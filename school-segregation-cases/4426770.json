Howell\n FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE\n ASSOCIATION d/b/a FANNIE MAE,\n\n                        Defendant.\n\n\n                                     MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n       The plaintiff, Ana Lapera, brings this lawsuit against her former employer, the Federal\n\nNational Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), alleging race discrimination in violation of the\n\nCivil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and age, race, and personal-appearance discrimination in\n\nviolation of the D.C. Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”), D.C. Code Ann. § 2-1401 et seq. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 1, 4, ECF No. 1-1. These claims are predicated on Ms. Lapera’s allegations that Fannie Mae\n\nimproperly classified her position’s salary grade (and rejected Ms. Lapera’s subsequent requests\n\nto relevel her salary grade), and declined to promote her on the basis of her race, age, and\n\nphysical appearance. Pending before the Court is Fannie Mae’s motion for summary judgment.\n\nDef.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Def.’s MSJ”), ECF No. 11. For the reasons set forth below, this motion\n\nis granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, while Ms. Lapera has shown no genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to whether Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her race or\n\npersonal appearance when it leveled her salary, she has adduced sufficient evidence to raise such\n\nan issue with respect to whether Fannie Mae’s proffered reason for passing over Ms. Lapera for\n\nthe position of Vice President of Planning and Alignment was pretextual.\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         The pertinent factual and procedural history for consideration of the pending motion for\n\nsummary judgment is summarized below.\n\n         A.       Facts\n\n         Ms. Lapera was born in Caracas, Venezuela, Plaintiff’s Arbitration Transcript (“Pl.’s\n\nArb. Tr.”) at 28, ECF No. 14-1, 1 and describes herself as having “a body size which may be\n\nperceived by some as being overweight,” Compl. ¶ 6. She holds a degree in systems engineering\n\nfrom a school in Venezuela as well as a master’s degree in engineering administration from\n\nGeorge Washington University. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 29. Ms. Lapera was employed by Fannie Mae,\n\n“a private, shareholder-owned company chartered by Congress,” Def.’s Statement of Undisputed\n\nFacts (“Def.’s SUF”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 11-1, in various positions for almost twenty years, from 1994\n\nthrough 2013, Pl.’s Arb Tr. at 29. Her career path at Fannie Mae is generally described below.\n\n                  1.       Ms. Lapera’s Early Career at Fannie Mae\n\n         Fannie Mae hired Ms. Lapera in 1994 to work as a manager in the advanced technology\n\ndivision of the IT department. Id. at 30. From there, Ms. Lapera transitioned to a development\n\nmanager position, and then to a position in which she helped coordinate a smooth technological\n\ntransition into the year 2000. Id. at 31. Thereafter, she was promoted to various Director-level\n\npositions. Id. at 41. For example, in 2008, Fannie Mae’s President selected Ms. Lapera to head\n\n\n\n\n1\n         Pursuant to Ms. Lapera’s employment contract, she initially brought the instant claims before an arbitrator\nin November 2014. Def.’s SUF ¶ 98. As described in more detail, infra Part I.B., the arbitration hearing involved\nthe examination of witnesses by both sides and resulted in an arbitral award in favor of Fannie Mae. Under the\nterms of the employment contract, the arbitral decision is in no way binding on this Court. See Fannie Mae Dispute\nResolution Policy (“DRP”) at ¶ 14, ECF No. 16-2 (“If the employee rejects the Award, it will not become binding\non the employee or the Company, and the employee may bring suit on the claim at his or her own expense.”). Both\nparties have submitted portions of the transcript from the arbitration hearing as factual support for their arguments in\nconnection with the pending summary judgment motion.\n\n                                                           2\n\fthe restructuring of operations and IT at Fannie Mae. Id. at 46. Then, in 2009, Ms. Lapera was\n\nselected to direct the new Lean Six Sigma team. 2 Id. at 49–50.\n\n                  2.       Ms. Lapera’s New Salary Grade\n\n         In June 2009, Fannie Mae adopted a new salary scale for employees. Whereas salary\n\ngrades had previously been on a numerical scale, the new scale was alphabetical, with letters\n\nlater in the alphabet corresponding to a higher salary. As the Director of Lean Six Sigma, Ms.\n\nLapera’s salary grade shifted from a “6” to an “M.” Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 524–25; Decl. of Ana\n\nLapera (“Lapera Decl.”) ¶ 7, ECF No. 14-2. At the same time, employees whom Ms. Lapera\n\nperceived to be her professional peers received higher salary grades of “N,” Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 85;\n\nher direct reports received salary grades of “M” and “L,” id. at 92; and several individuals who\n\nallegedly had less responsibility than Ms. Lapera received a salary grade of “N,” Decl. of Ana\n\nLapera ¶ 8. Moreover, Fannie Mae posted an available position that required less education and\n\nexperience than Ms. Lapera’s position and stated that the position would command an “N” grade\n\nsalary. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 93–97.\n\n         On July 18, 2009, Ms. Lapera emailed her manager, Claude Wade, to explain why she\n\nbelieved that her position was assigned an improperly low salary grade and to request an “N”\n\ngrade salary. 3 Id. at 86. In response, Mr. Wade advised Ms. Lapera that he had inquired with\n\nthe human resources department and was informed that the “M” salary grade for her position\n\nwould stand. Id. at 87. Ms. Lapera requested a salary upgrade to level “N” again in April 2011,\n\n\n\n2\n         As described by Ms. Lapera during arbitration, Lean Six Sigma is a “process improvement methodology.”\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 50. “Lean” refers to “reduc[ing] waste” and “looking at everything from the customer perspective.”\nId. “Six Sigma” refers to “us[ing] statistics to make sure that you always g[e]t the output that your customer wants.”\nId. “So when you combine the two methodologies, it can be very, very powerful to streamline a company, to\nstreamline operations, and to make sure that the output . . . is exactly [right].” Id.\n3\n         Ms. Lapera surmises, based on her employee compensation statements, that the “M” salary range was\n$112,000 to $194,000, and the “N” salary range was $129,000 to $222,000. Lapera Decl. ¶ 10; Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n\nDef.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), Ex. L at 2–3, ECF No. 14-12.\n\n                                                          3\n\fwhich request was also denied. Pl.’s Mem. Opp’n Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), Ex. K,\n\nECF No. 14-11. In 2012, Fannie Mae increased Ms. Lapera’s salary by $28,000, however, as\n\npart of the Promotion and Equity Process (“PEP”), which managers can use to that their\n\nsubordinates’ salaries be increased based on performance. Def.’s Arbitration Transcript (“Def.’s\n\nArb. Tr.”) at 571, ECF No. 11-3.\n\n                 3.       Fannie Mae’s Non-Selection of Ms. Lapera for Vice President\n\n        In September 2012, Anne Gehring, who at that time worked in the Financial Planning and\n\nAnalysis division, was selected to be Senior Vice President of the Enterprise Program\n\nManagement Office (“EPMO”). Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 102–03. 4 As relevant in this case, Ms. Gehring\n\nconsistently emphasized that employees in her department should have “executive presence,” see\n\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 714, a term she did not explicitly define. The parties dispute the meaning of the\n\nterm: Fannie Mae contends that the term “executive presence” “is widely used in business\n\ncircles to describe the ability to project mature self-confidence, a sense that you can take control\n\nof difficult, unpredictable situations; make tough decisions in a timely way and hold your own\n\nwith other talented and strong-willed members of the executive team.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot.\n\nDismiss (“Def.’s Mem.”) at 22, ECF 11-2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Ms. Lapera, on\n\nthe other hand, contends that Ms. Gehring used the term “to criticize the appearance of\n\noverweight, older, and minority Fannie Mae employees.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 2; id. at 12 (“[Ms.\n\nGehring] consistently characterized employees who were not Caucasian, young, and slender as\n\nlacking ‘executive presence.’”). One Fannie Mae employee, Jim Tomasello, testified during\n\narbitration as follows:\n\n             So the term “executive presence” was a theme that [Ms. Gehring] beat the\n             drum on regularly and, really, from the beginning of the time that she was\n\n4\n      The arbitrator opined that, “[b]y virtually all accounts, Ms. Gehring was a brash and unpopular executive.”\nJAMS Arbitration Award (“Arbitration Award”) at 3, ECF No. 11-41.\n\n                                                        4\n\f           over the EPMO. It was a bar that she never really explained but was\n           talked about, you know, being able to be put in front of executives and\n           basically evaluated people based off of that. We as a group were sent to\n           an image training session where a consultant was brought in to speak\n           specifically about what executive presence meant and what it would take\n           for individuals to, in addition to delivering results, would have to exude to\n           be able to be considered, you know, for promotion or a well-performing\n           employee.\n\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 714.\n\n       As for Ms. Gehring’s treatment of employees, Ms. Lapera’s describes a disconcerting\n\npattern of comments and behavior. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 14 (“Ms. Gehring began to regularly use\n\n[two co-workers] as examples of employees who did not ‘fit the team’s image’. . . and criticized\n\n‘the way they conduct[ed] themselves’, ‘the way they s[a]t’, and the way ‘their tummies\n\nsometimes show[ed].’”); Pl.’s Opp’n at 10, ECF No. 14. (“Ms. Gehring immediately began to\n\ntarget employees who did not meet her standard of an ideal personal appearance, which was\n\nCaucasian, young, and slender.”). Ms. Lapera testified during arbitration that, among other\n\nthings, Ms. Gehring (1) transferred a Hispanic female to a different group, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 105–\n\n08; (2) frequently criticized the personal appearance of her subordinates, id. at 110–13\n\n(explaining that Ms. Gehring chided one overweight employee for “waddling” in front of the\n\ndirectors and commented that another overweight woman had her midriff exposed at work), id. at\n\n137–39; (3) pressured staff to attend a class put on by an image consultant, id. at 118–29;\n\n(4) regularly commented that she ate only a yogurt and banana for breakfast to keep her weight\n\ndown and that other employees should do the same, id. at 139; and (5) in conducting employee\n\nreviews, took an employee’s appearances and another employee’s accent into account, id. at\n\n133–35.\n\n       Less than one year after Ms. Gehring became Senior Vice President, one of her\n\nsubordinates, Kathy Keller, who was Vice President of EPMO Planning and Alignment and Ms.\n\n                                                 5\n\fLapera’s direct supervisor, left her position after Ms. Gehring “communicated to Kathy that it\n\nwasn’t working out and instructed her to look for opportunities elsewhere in Fannie Mae.” Id. at\n\n142–43; id. at 606. 5 On June 3, 2013, Fannie Mae solicited applications to fill Ms. Keller’s\n\nposition. Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. M, ECF No. 14-13. Ms. Lapera applied. Id., Ex. O, ECF No. 14-15.\n\nBefore the job was posted, Ms. Gehring noted that Joe Hallet, a Caucasian male already\n\nemployed at Fannie Mae, might be a good candidate to fill the open position, and he applied for\n\nthe position. Id., Ex. N, ECF No. 14-14. 6 A third candidate, Nicola Fraser, did not initially\n\napply, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 426–27, but after the formal deadline to apply had expired, Ms. Fraser,\n\nwho was then a Vice President on maternity leave, Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 238, had dinner with Ms.\n\nGehring and discussed the opening. Id. at 332; Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 28, ECF No. 11-28. Ms. Fraser\n\nthen submitted her résumé to the Human Resources Department. Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 431; Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 30, ECF No. 11-30.\n\n         All three candidates were interviewed by Shandell Harris from the Human Resources\n\nDepartment, Mike Choi, a Vice President in EPMO, and Ms. Gehring. Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 34, ECF\n\nNo. 11-34. Ms. Fraser was ultimately selected to fill the Vice President of EPMO Planning and\n\nAlignment position. Lapera Decl. ¶ 24; Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 152. Ms. Gehring relayed Fannie Mae’s\n\nhiring decision to Ms. Lapera in a face-to-face meeting. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 152. Several months\n\nlater, Ms. Lapera left Fannie Mae and became a consultant. Def.’s SUF ¶ 96.\n\n\n\n\n5\n          A human resources employee testified that Ms. Keller was not asked to resign from her position. See Pl.’s\nArb. Tr. at 467 (“Q. Was Ms. Keller asked to resign from her position? A. No. Q. And how do you know Ms.\nKeller was not asked to resign from her position? A. Because Ms. Keller came to me and asked me for a package.”).\n6\n          Ms. Gehring flatly denied having pre-selected Mr. Hallet for the position during her arbitration testimony.\nSee Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 606-07 (“Q. [D]id you communicate to individuals in human resources that you wanted to place\nJoe Hallet in the position and you wanted to find out what was needed to get him through the process . . . ? A.\nNo.”).\n\n                                                         6\n\f       B.      Procedural History\n\n       Ms. Lapera pursued her claims in nonbinding arbitration as required by her employment\n\nagreement. See generally Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 40 (“Demand for Arbitration”), ECF No. 11-40.\n\nFollowing an opportunity for discovery, the parties participated in a four-day hearing before the\n\narbitrator, during which the parties presented witness testimony subject to cross-examination,\n\nsubmitted documentary evidence, and filed post-hearing briefs. See JAMS Arbitration Award\n\n(“Arbitration Award”) at 2, ECF No. 11-41. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Fannie Mae. Id. at\n\n6. As to Ms. Lapera’s racial discrimination claims, the arbitrator found that “no evidence [] of\n\nrace discrimination was adduced during the four days of trial.” Id. at 2. As for Ms. Lapera’s\n\nclaim that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on account of her personal appearance in\n\nrefusing to relevel her salary grade, the arbitrator concluded that “the . . . record demonstrates an\n\norderly and regular, if slow, process that ultimately resulted in a significant salary increase for\n\nMs. Lapera,” and that “[n]o evidence or even hint of discrimination appears [in the] record.” Id.\n\nat 3. Finally, the arbitrator rejected Ms. Lapera’s non-promotion claim, finding that Ms. Lapera\n\nhad not proven that Fannie Mae’s proffered non-discriminatory reason for selecting Ms. Fraser\n\nwas pretextual. Id. at 6 (“All of Ms[.] Lapera’s testimony about Ms[.] Gehring’s treatment of\n\nother employees was anecdotal, and most of it was either uncorroborated or disputed. Most\n\nimportantly, however: except for Ms[.] Lapera’s testimony about her own belief and her own\n\nself-image, there was no evidence in the record that anyone said, thought, or acted upon a\n\nperception that Ms[.] Lapera herself was overweight, or improperly dressed, or possessed of an\n\nunattractive body shape.”).\n\n       As allowed under Fannie Mae’s Dispute Resolution Policy, Ms. Lapera rejected the\n\narbitral award and filed a complaint in D.C. Superior Court on January 27, 2015. See Fannie\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fMae Dispute Resolution Policy (“DRP”) at ¶ 14, ECF No. 16-2 (“The employee may, within 30\n\ncalendar days of the date of issuance of the Award, reject it, in its entirety, by sending a\n\ncompleted ‘Rejection of Arbitration Award’ form to JAMS and [Fannie Mae’s Compliance and\n\nEthics Department].”); see also generally Compl. Fannie Mae removed the action to this Court\n\non March 27, 2015. See generally Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.\n\n       Ms. Lapera’s complaint asserts two claims against Fannie Mae under the DCHRA and\n\n§ 1981. In Count I, Ms. Lapera contends that Fannie Mae violated the DCHRA by “knowingly\n\nand intentionally engag[ing] in unlawful discrimination against [Ms. Lapera] based on her race,\n\nage and personal appearance” by, inter alia, assigning Ms. Lapera’s position of Director of Lean\n\nSix Sigma a salary grade of “M” and denying Ms. Lapera a promotion to the position of Vice\n\nPresident of EPMO Planning and Alignment. Compl. ¶ 30. Similarly, in Count II, Ms. Lapera\n\ncontends that Fannie Mae violated § 1981 by “knowingly and intentionally subject[ing] [Ms.\n\nLapera] to discrimination based on her race, Hispanic American, when [Fannie Mae] failed to\n\nreclassify her position properly form [sic] 2009 through 2012 . . . ; discriminated against her in\n\nthe evaluation of her performance . . . ; and denied Ms. Lapera a promotion to the position of\n\nVice President of Planning and Alignment . . . .” Id. ¶ 35. As relief, Ms. Lapera seeks a\n\ndeclaration that Fannie Mae violated the DCHRA and § 1981; a permanent injunction\n\nprohibiting Fannie Mae from engaging in any discriminatory employment practices; back pay\n\nand front pay in an amount to be determined at trial; an order prohibiting Fannie Mae from\n\nretaliating against Ms. Lapera or any other person for participating in this case; compensatory\n\nand punitive damages in amounts to be determined by an arbitrator; reasonable attorneys’ fees,\n\nexpert fees, and costs; and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. Id. at 11.\n\n       Fannie Mae’s motion for summary judgment is now ripe for consideration.\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 provides that summary judgment is appropriate “if the\n\nmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Summary judgment is properly granted\n\nagainst a party who, “after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, . . . fails to make a\n\nshowing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on\n\nwhich that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n\n322 (1986). The moving party bears the burden to demonstrate the “absence of a genuine issue\n\nof material fact” in dispute, id. at 323, while the nonmoving party must present specific facts\n\nsupported by materials in the record that would be admissible at trial and that could enable a\n\nreasonable jury to find in its favor, see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. (“Liberty Lobby”), 477\n\nU.S. 242, 248 (1986); Allen v. Johnson, 795 F.3d 34, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (noting that, on\n\nsummary judgment, the appropriate inquiry is “whether, on the evidence so viewed, a reasonable\n\njury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party”) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) and (e)(2)–(3).\n\n       “Evaluating whether evidence offered at summary judgment is sufficient to send a case to\n\nthe jury is as much art as science.” Estate of Parsons v. Palestinian Auth., 651 F.3d 118, 123\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2011). This evaluation is guided by the related principles that “courts may not resolve\n\ngenuine disputes of fact in favor of the party seeking summary judgment,” Tolan v. Cotton, 134\n\nS.Ct. 1861, 1866 (2014), and “[t]he evidence of the nonmovant is to be believed, and all\n\njustifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor,” id. at 1863 (quoting Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S.\n\nat 255). Courts must avoid making “credibility determinations or weigh[ing] the evidence,”\n\nsince “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\finferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge.” Reeves v.

The Court is required to\n\nconsider only the materials explicitly cited by the parties, but may on its own accord consider\n\n“other materials in the record.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3).\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       Ms. Lapera asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her age,\n\nrace, and personal appearance by leveling her salary at the “M” level and by selecting a different\n\ncandidate for the Vice President of Planning and Alignment position. These claims are\n\naddressed seriatim below after first explaining the applicable legal framework.\n\n       A.      Statutory Overview\n\n               1.      Section 1981\n\n       Section 1981 guarantees the rights of all persons, regardless of their race, to “make and\n\nenforce contracts.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). The statute defines the phrase “make and enforce\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fcontracts” as “including the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts,\n\nand the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual\n\nrelationship.” Id. § 1981(b). A plaintiff asserting an employment discrimination claim under\n\n§ 1981 “must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the actions taken by the\n\nemployer were ‘more likely than not based on the consideration of . . . race.’” Pollard v. Quest\n\nDiagnostics, 610 F. Supp. 2d 1, 18 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\n\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981)). “[T]he plaintiff may either prove his claim with direct\n\nevidence of discrimination or he may indirectly prove discrimination under the familiar burden-\n\nshifting analysis of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973).” Olatunji v.\n\nDist. of Columbia, 958 F. Supp. 2d 27, 31 (D.D.C. 2013); accord Walker v. McCarthy, No. 14-\n\n266, 2016 WL 1118252, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 22, 2016).\n\n       Under McDonnell Douglas, discrimination claims are analyzed according to a three-step\n\nframework:\n\n           First, the plaintiff has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the\n           evidence a prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff\n           succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the\n           defendant “to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the\n           [action in question].” Third, should the defendant carry this burden, the\n           plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the\n           evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its\n           true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\n\nTex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252–53 (1981) (quoting McDonnell\n\nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802).\n\n       “While this framework generally requires the plaintiff to bear the initial burden of\n\nmaking out a prima facie case of discrimination, the D.C. Circuit has clarified that courts ‘need\n\nnot—and should not—decide whether the plaintiff actually made out a prima facie case under\n\nMcDonnell Douglas,’ where (1) ‘an employee has suffered an adverse employment action’ and\n\n                                                11\n\f(2) ‘an employer has asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision.’” Walker,\n\n2016 WL 1118252, at *6 (quoting Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2008) (emphasis in original)). In such cases, Brady instructs the Court to bypass McDonnell\n\nDouglas and instead consider “one central question: Has the employee produced sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted non-discriminatory reason was\n\nnot the actual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee on\n\nthe basis of race . . . ?” Brady, 520 F.3d at 494. To answer this question, the Court will consider\n\n“all the evidence, including ‘(1) the plaintiff’s prima facie case; (2) any evidence the plaintiff\n\npresents to attack the employer’s proffered explanation for its action; and (3) any further\n\nevidence of discrimination that may be available to the plaintiff (such as independent evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer).’” Carter v. George Wash.\n\nUniv., 387 F.3d 872, 878 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Waterhouse v. Dist. of Columbia, 298 F.3d\n\n989, 992–93 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).\n\n               2.      DCHRA\n\n       The DCHRA prohibits discrimination on the basis of, among other things, “race, . . . age,\n\n[and] personal appearance.” D.C. Code § 2-1401.01. As relevant here, the DCHRA expressly\n\nprovides that an employer may not “fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge, any individual; or\n\notherwise to discriminate against any individual, with respect to his compensation, terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment, including promotion; or to limit, segregate, or classify\n\nhis employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.” D.C. Code § 2-1402.11.\n\nDCHRA claims are evaluated under the same framework as § 1981 claims. See Pitts v. Howard\n\nUniv., 111 F. Supp. 3d 9, 24 (D.D.C. 2015) (citing Ayissi–Etoh v. Fannie Mae, 712 F.3d 572,\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f576 (D.C. Cir. 2013)). That is, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the Court\n\nemploys McDonnell Douglas to decide whether a plaintiff has marshaled enough evidence to\n\ntake her claims to a jury. Olatunji, 958 F. Supp. 2d at 31.\n\n        B.        Ms. Lapera’s Age Discrimination Claims\n\n        Ms. Lapera’s complaint asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of\n\nher age in violation of the DCHRA by (1) classifying her position at the “M” salary grade and\n\ndenying her subsequent requests to relevel her salary grade, and (2) failing to promote her to the\n\nposition of Vice President of EPMO Planning and Alignment. Compl. ¶¶ 11–12, 23. Fannie\n\nMae contends that it is “entitled to judgment as a matter of law on [Ms. Lapera’s] age\n\ndiscrimination claims brought under the DCHRA because they were not first arbitrated as\n\nrequired by Fannie Mae’s Dispute Resolution Policy (the ‘DRP’).” Def.’s Mem. at 4. Fannie\n\nMae is correct.\n\n        The arbitration policy governing Ms. Lapera’s employment relationship with Fannie Mae\n\nunambiguously provides that an employee “must arbitrate” “all claims . . . against Fannie Mae\n\n. . . involving a legally-protected right, that directly or indirectly relate to . . . employment”\n\n“before bringing suit . . . in court.” DRP ¶¶ 1–2. Among the claims that an employee must\n\narbitrate before proceeding to court are “claims involving rights protected by . . . federal[] [and]\n\nstate . . . law.” Id. ¶ 2. Consequently, if, as Fannie Mae asserts, Ms. Lapera did not first arbitrate\n\nher age-discrimination claims, then this Court is not empowered to adjudicate such claims. See\n\nNat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston & Maine Corp., 850 F.2d 756, 759 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (“It is\n\na necessary corollary of the principle that ‘arbitration is a matter of contract’ that when the\n\nparties have provided that a particular type of dispute should be settled in arbitration, rather than\n\n\n\n\n                                                   13\n\fin litigation, a court may not override that agreement by itself deciding such a dispute.”\n\n(emphasis omitted)).\n\n       Ms. Lapera’s Demand for Arbitration failed to reference age discrimination in its\n\nintroductory section and alleged only that “Fannie Mae engaged in discrimination against Ms.\n\nLapera on the basis of race and personal appearance in compensation, evaluation of\n\nperformance, and promotions.” Demand for Arbitration at 6. Indeed, all three counts asserted in\n\nher Demand for Arbitration “sounded in race or personal appearance discrimination.” Def.’s\n\nReply Supp. Mot. Dismiss (“Def.’s Reply”) at 4, ECF 16-1; see Demand for Arbitration at 13\n\n(alleging that Fannie Mae “engaged in unlawful discrimination against [Ms. Lapera] [in violation\n\nof the DCHRA] based on her race and personal appearance”); id. at 14 (alleging that Fannie Mae\n\n“engaged in unlawful discrimination against Ms. Lapera [in violation of Title VII] based on her\n\nrace”); id. at 15 (alleging that Fannie Mae “subjected [Ms. Lapera] to discrimination based on\n\nher race, Hispanic American”).\n\n       Ms. Lapera advances two arguments to overcome her apparent failure to raise any claim\n\nof age discrimination in arbitration. See Pl.’s Opp’n at 38–41. First, she contends that she\n\nadequately alleged age discrimination because her Demand for Arbitration referenced her age as\n\nwell as the age of the selectee, Ms. Fraser. Id. at 38–39. Mere reference to age does not,\n\nhowever, amount to an actual assertion of a cause of action for age discrimination for purposes\n\nof exhaustion. Cf. Coleman v. Johnson, 19 F. Supp. 3d 126, 139 (D.D.C. 2014) (dismissing the\n\nplaintiff’s race and age discrimination claims notwithstanding the complaint’s\n\n“fleeting reference to his allegedly ‘being subject to harassment because of age and race’”); Allen\n\nv. Henifin, No. 80-1418, 1980 WL 281, *3 (D.D.C. Dec. 10, 1980) (unpublished) (dismissing age\n\ndiscrimination claim for failure to administratively exhaust when plaintiff’s references to\n\n\n\n                                                14\n\finstituting litigation “never referred to an age discrimination claim” and therefore “can in no way\n\nbe construed to allege age discrimination or to constitute notice of intent to file such a suit”).\n\n        Second, Ms. Lapera argues that Fannie Mae’s Dispute Resolution Policy, which requires\n\nemployees to arbitrate their claims against Fannie Mae before proceeding to court, is\n\n“unconscionable and unfairly lopsided.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 39. In support of this argument, Ms.\n\nLapera supplies an unadorned citation to a nonbinding, non-federal, out-of-circuit unpublished\n\ndecision by a California Court of Appeal, Cecelia Carter v. Fannie Mae, Cal. Super. Ct. No. 30-\n\n2013-00647896 (Cal. Sup. Ct. Aug. 26, 2014). Rather than follow a California State Court\n\ndecision, this Court instead adheres to the decisions by other Judges from this Court that enforce\n\nthe DPR’s arbitration requirement. See, e.g., Skrynnikov v. Fed. Nat’l Mortg. Ass’n, 943 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 172, 177–78 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that the DPR’s “broad and inclusive language”\n\ndoes not render the agreement unenforceable). Accordingly, Ms. Lapera’s conceded failure to\n\npursue any age-discrimination claims in arbitration forecloses her attempt to do so here. 7\n\n        C.       Ms. Lapera’s Race and Personal-Appearance Discrimination Claims\n\n        As for her remaining discrimination claims, which are properly before this Court, Ms.\n\nLapera contends that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her race and personal\n\nappearance by (1) classifying her position at the “M” salary grade, and (2) failing to promote her\n\nto the position of Vice President of EPMO Planning and Alignment. 8 Before turning to Ms.\n\nLapera’s claims arising out of each incident, the parties’ arguments as to whether Ms. Lapera’s\n\nHispanic identity qualifies as race within the meaning of § 1981 are addressed first.\n\n\n\n\n7\n          Thus Fannie Mae’s alternative argument that Ms. Lapera’s age-discrimination claims are barred by the\nDCHRA’s statute of limitations, see Def.’s Mem. at 10; Def.’s Reply at 7–8, need not be addressed.\n8\n          Ms. Lapera’s DCHRA and § 1981 racial discrimination claims are addressed together since, as noted, supra\nPart III.A., the same standard applies.\n\n                                                       15\n\f                  1.        Hispanic Ethnicity is a Race for Purposes of § 1981\n\n         Section 1981 “forbid[s] all ‘racial’ discrimination in the making of private as well as\n\npublic contracts.” Saint Francis College v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S. 604, 609 (1987); accord\n\nCBOCS W., Inc. v. Humphries, 553 U.S. 442, 459 n.1 (2008). Fannie Mae argues that § 1981\n\n“does not provide a cause of action for [Ms. Lapera’s] theories of discrimination based on her\n\n. . . alleged Hispanic national origin.” Def.’s Mem. at 6 (emphasis added). Ms. Lapera responds\n\nthat “District of Columbia courts have overwhelmingly recognized claims of race, ethnic and\n\nnational origin discrimination under Section 1981 based on a plaintiff’s Hispanic identity.” Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n at 35 (collecting cases). While not entirely clear whether Fannie Mae’s position is that\n\nHispanic ethnicity is not a race for purposes of § 1981 or that Ms. Lapera’s racial discrimination\n\nclaims rely on her country of origin rather than her race, either way, Fannie Mae’s argument\n\nfails.\n\n         After the parties submitted their briefing in this case, the Second Circuit addressed the\n\nissue whether Hispanic is a race under § 1981. See Village of Freeport v. Barrella, 814 F.3d\n\n594, 600–10 (2d Cir. 2016). In Village of Freeport, the defendant–employer defended against\n\nthe plaintiff–employee’s § 1981 and Title VII claims on the ground that Hispanic is not a distinct\n\nrace from Caucasian and, accordingly, the Hispanic plaintiff and his Caucasian coworker “are\n\nboth white in the estimation of federal antidiscrimination statutes, and [the government\n\nofficial’s] decision to promote one white candidate rather than another could not have constituted\n\nracial discrimination.” 9 Id. at 601. The Second Circuit roundly rejected that argument, finding\n\nthat “it has been clear since the Reagan Administration that § 1981 bars employers from\n\n\n9\n         Village of Freeport had a slightly different posture than this case, as the plaintiff there was an Italian-\nAmerican (i.e., Caucasian) and argued that the defendant had hired a less qualified Hispanic for the position of\npolice chief. Id. at 598. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit plainly held that “discrimination based on Hispanic\nancestry or lack thereof constitutes racial discrimination under that statute.” Id.\n\n                                                           16\n\fdiscriminating based on Hispanic ethnicity or lack thereof.” Id. at 609; see also id. at 598 (“[W]e\n\nreiterate that ‘race’ includes ethnicity for purposes of § 1981, so that discrimination based on\n\nHispanic ancestry or lack thereof constitutes racial discrimination under that statute.”); Pavon v.\n\nSwift Transp. Co., Inc.,192 F.3d 902, 908 (9th Cir. 1999) (rejecting the argument that\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of being Hispanic is not actionable under § 1981 and upholding the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling in favor of the Hispanic plaintiff).\n\n        The Second Circuit’s decision is persuasive and has unequivocal support in the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Saint Francis College, 481 U.S. at 613. There, the Supreme Court addressed\n\nthe question “whether a person of Arabian ancestry was protected from racial discrimination\n\nunder § 1981.” Id. at 607. In so doing, the Court considered the common understanding of race\n\nat the time that § 1981 was enacted (as found in dictionaries and encyclopedias) as well as the\n\nlegislative history of § 1981, “which . . . had its source in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 [and] the\n\nVoting Rights Act of 1870.” Id. at 610–13. The Court found that “dictionaries commonly\n\nreferred to race as a ‘continued series of descendants from a parent who is called the stock,” id. at\n\n610 (quoting N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 666 (New York\n\n1860) (emphasis in original)), and that “[e]ncyclopedias of the 19th century also described race\n\nin terms of ethnic groups,” id. at 611 (providing as examples “Finns,” “gypsies,” “Basques,”\n\n“Hebrews,” and many others). The legislative history “reflect[ed] this [] understanding” of race.\n\nId. at 612. “Based on the history of § 1981,” the Court had “little trouble in concluding that\n\nCongress intended to protect from discrimination identifiable classes of persons who are\n\nsubjected to intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). Accordingly, no legitimate dispute remains that Hispanic ethnicity is a\n\nrace for purposes of § 1981.\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f         Likewise, any argument by Fannie Mae that Ms. Lapera has alleged discrimination on the\n\nbasis of her country of origin, rather than her Hispanic race, fails. No reasonable reading of Ms.\n\nLapera’s complaint or papers suggests that she believes she was discriminated against on account\n\nof her Venezuelan national origin. Ms. Lapera has consistently stated that she was discriminated\n\nagainst based on her Hispanic ethnicity. Thus, because Hispanic is a race for purposes of § 1981\n\nand because Ms. Lapera’s complaint alleges that she was discriminated against based upon her\n\nHispanic ethnicity, her racial discrimination claims are legally cognizable.\n\n                  2.        Salary Leveling Claims\n\n         Ms. Lapera asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her race and\n\npersonal appearance when the company releveled salaries and assigned her position, Director of\n\nLean Six Sigma, the salary grade of “M” rather than “N,” and then rejected her requests to\n\nchange her salary grade to an “N.” Fannie Mae contends that Ms. Lapera fails to make out a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination with this claim but that even if she had, Fannie Mae had\n\n“legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons” for declining to relevel Ms. Lapera’s position’s salary.\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 10.\n\n         In opposing summary judgment on her salary leveling claim, Ms. Lapera focuses\n\nexclusively on her prima facie case, arguing that several facts give rise to an inference of\n\ndiscrimination. 10 See Pl.’s Opp’n at 32–34. Problematically for Ms. Lapera, however, Fannie\n\nMae has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation as to why it initially assigned her\n\nposition an “M” salary grade and why her subsequent requests for releveling were denied. See\n\n\n\n\n10\n          Ms. Lapera points to the fact that “Fannie Mae employees with similar qualifications and duties outside her\nprotected classes were classified at level ‘N’” and that her peers with “significantly less responsibility . . . were also\nclassified under an ‘N’ salary grade.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 33. Furthermore, one of Ms. Lapera’s direct reports received\nher same salary grade of “M.” Id. at 34. Finally, postings for positions with “fewer responsibilities and\nqualification requirements than Ms. Lapera’s position were also posted at higher levels than her position.” Id.\n\n                                                           18\n\fAdeyemi v. Dist. of Columbia, 525 F.3d 1222, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (explaining that a plaintiff’s\n\nprima facie case is an “‘unnecessary sideshow’” where the defendant proffers a legitimate\n\nrationale for its decision and admonishing the parties for devoting much of their briefing to the\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case (quoting St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. V. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 510–11\n\n(1993))). In particular, Fannie Mae has asserted that its Compensation Department assigned all\n\npositions’ salary grades by looking at market wages for a given job description and then slotting\n\nthat position into the appropriate salary grade. 11 See Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 525 (“[T]he structure was\n\nbuilt based on available market data. There are companies that produce compensation surveys\n\nand that’s how we get our market data. . . . We use market data for positions to determine the\n\ngrade level . . . .”). Critically, the Compensation Department did not consider in any way the\n\ncharacteristics or performance of the individual who occupied a given position. Id. at 531\n\n(explaining that the leveling “wasn’t related to performance in any way . . . [and it] didn’t\n\nconsider the individual”); id. at 558–59 (“[W]hen we’re levelling positions, we are not looking at\n\nindividuals. We are looking at the position itself.”); id. at 566 (“The position levelling work that\n\nwe do isn’t based on the individual person.”). 12\n\n         Fannie Mae likewise offered a nondiscriminatory explanation as to why Ms. Lapera’s\n\nsubsequent requests to relevel her position’s salary grade were denied. As for her first request in\n\nApril 2009, Ms. Lapera consulted her supervisor, Claude Wade, to ask whether her position was\n\neligible for a salary upgrade. Mr. Wade inquired with the Compensation Department, and the\n\nCompensation Department determined that a change was not appropriate, apparently because the\n\n\n\n11\n          It is true that Fannie Mae supervisors interfaced with the Compensation Department to help the individual\ntasked with leveling a position understand the responsibilities and nature of that position, see Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 532–\n33, but Ms. Lapera does not assert that her job description was inaccurate.\n12\n          Ms. Lapera summarily takes issue with these statements in her Statement of Disputed Material Facts, see\nPl.’s Statement of Disputed Material Facts (“SDMF”) at 4–5, ECF No. 14-21, but points to no evidence in the record\nto refute the evidence showing that the salary grades were assigned based on objective markers and data.\n\n                                                          19\n\fsalary grade had just been leveled and there was no obvious reason to change it. See Pl.’s Arb.\n\nTr. at 535–36. 13 As for the second request, Shandell Harris (“Ms. Harris”), a human resources\n\nbusiness partner, id. at 462, emailed the Director of Compensation, Nicole Harris Westwood\n\n(“Ms. Westwood” 14), in the spring of 2011 asking Ms. Westwood to “look at [the Director of\n\nLean Six Sigma position] and level it.” Id. at 538. The request contained no additional context,\n\nid., 15 and Ms. Westwood did not construe Ms. Harris’s inquiry as a challenge, id. at 539.\n\nApparently, Ms. Westwood thought that Ms. Harris was asking her to determine what the salary\n\ngrade would be for a position with the position description that mirrored the description for\n\nDirector of Lean Six Sigma. In considering Ms. Harris’s inquiry, Ms. Westwood discovered that\n\nthe job already existed and that the salary grade for the position was “M.” She relayed that\n\ninformation to Ms. Harris, evidently ending the inquiry. Id. (“[The request] came to me as\n\n[‘C]an you look at this and level it[?’] And so my translation was, oh, we have this job, and it’s\n\nthe job that Ms. Lapera is in and it’s an M.”).\n\n         Finally, in May or June of 2011, Ms. Harris submitted a request as part of the Promotion\n\nand Equity Process (“PEP”). Under PEP, a manager can submit, on behalf of his or her\n\nsubordinates, a request for a salary increase. Unlike the leveling process, the PEP process\n\naccounts for the employee’s performance and personal characteristics. Id. at 573. A member of\n\nthe Compensation Department, Sonia Matza, reviewed Ms. Lapera’s PEP request along with Ms.\n\n\n\n\n13\n          Notably, the individual who responded to the reclassification request, Mauricio Aguilar, is a member of\nMs. Lapera’s racial class, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 566, which “further undermines any inference of discrimination.” Glass\nv. Lahood, 786 F. Supp. 2d 189, 216 (D.D.C. 2011).\n14\n          Ms. Harris Westwood stated during her testimony that she goes by “Ms. Harris,” Arb. Tr. at 523, but to\navoid confusion, she is referred to as “Ms. Westwood.”\n15\n          Ms. Harris did attach a job description for the Director of Lean Six Sigma position to her email along with\na job description for a different position that had been assigned an “N” salary grade. Id. at 540-41. Ms. Westwood\ntestified that she did not recall seeing the second job description and that, in any event, she did not perceive Ms.\nHarris to be challenging the salary grade for the Director of Lean Six Sigma position. Id.\n\n                                                         20\n\fHarris, id. at 548, and ultimately increased Ms. Lapera’s salary by $28,000 to create a 17%\n\ndifferential between Ms. Lapera’s salary and her direct report’s salary, id. at 571.\n\n         In sum, then, Fannie Mae has amply proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for\n\nits salary leveling decisions at issue in this case. Thus, this Court need not analyze whether Ms.\n\nLapera has made out a prima facie case of discrimination on this ground. See Walker, 2016 WL\n\n1118252, at *6. The only question is whether, based on all the evidence, a reasonable jury could\n\nfind that Fannie Mae’s stated reason is pretexual, and that the classification decision was\n\nmotivated by racial or personal-appearance animus. See Brady, 520 F.3d at 594; Primas v. Dist.\n\nof Columbia, 719 F.3d 693, 697 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“Without overt evidence of discriminatory\n\nintent, [the plaintiff’s] case turns on her attempts to show ‘that the defendant’s explanation is\n\nunworthy of credence’ and that a jury could ‘reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation\n\nthat the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.’” (quoting Reeves, 530\n\nU.S. at 147)). As noted, in addressing her salary leveling claims, Ms. Lapera does not so much\n\nas mention pretext, let alone point to evidence in the record that creates as a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether the Compensation Department acted with a discriminatory motive in\n\nleveling Ms. Lapera’s salary or in later declining to adjust her salary grade. Accordingly, Fannie\n\nMae is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Lapera’s salary leveling claims. 16\n\n                  3.       Non-Selection Claims\n\n         Ms. Lapera’s complaint asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of\n\nher race and personal appearance when Fannie Mae passed over Ms. Lapera for the position of\n\nVice President of Planning and Alignment and instead hired Ms. Fraser. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 35. In\n\n\n16\n        Ms. Lapera’s salary leveling claims are obviously unmeritorious given her failure to address pretext.\nAccordingly, this Court need not address Fannie Mae’s alternative argument that the statute of limitations ran on\nMs. Lapera’s claim arising out of her 2009 request for reclassification of her position’s salary grade. See Def.’s\nMem. at 10; Def.’s Reply at 12.\n\n                                                         21\n\fparticular, Ms. Lapera argues that Ms. Gehring declined to promote Ms. Lapera because she was\n\nHispanic and overweight and that Ms. Gehring chose Ms. Fraser for the position because she was\n\nCaucasian and slender. 17 Pl.’s Opp’n at 24. “Where, as here, the employer claims a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory explanation for its decision to promote one employee over another, the ‘one\n\ncentral inquiry’ on summary judgment is ‘whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for\n\na reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the\n\nactual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a\n\nprohibited basis.’” Hamilton v. Geithner, 666 F.3d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (quoting\n\nAdeyemi, 525 F.3d at 1226). In addressing this question, the Court considers “‘the total\n\ncircumstances of the case,’ asking ‘whether the jury could infer discrimination from the\n\ncombination of (1) the plaintiff’s prima facie case; (2) any evidence the plaintiff presents to\n\nattack the employer’s proffered explanation for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of\n\ndiscrimination that may be available to the plaintiff . . . or any contrary evidence that may be\n\navailable to the employer.” Hamilton, 666 F.3d at 1351 (quoting Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr., 156\n\nF.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc)).\n\n         Ms. Lapera contends that (1) she was significantly more qualified for the position than\n\nMs. Fraser, Pl.’s Opp’n at 27–29; (2) no evidence suggests that she had any communication\n\n\n17\n          Ms. Lapera contends that she has adduced direct evidence of discrimination as to her non-selection claims.\nPl.’s Opp’n at 24–25. In fact, however, the “direct evidence” that Ms. Lapera points to is indirect evidence of\ndiscrimination rather than direct evidence. The evidence that Ms. Lapera relies on suggests more broadly that Ms.\nGehring exhibited discriminatory attitudes toward Hispanic employees and overweight employees. None of the\ncited evidence, however, proves that Fannie Mae’s selection of Ms. Fraser over Ms. Lapera for the Vice President of\nEPMO Planning position was the result of discrimination. See Ayissi-Etoh, 712 F.3d at 576 (explaining that direct\nevidence of discrimination is, for example, a “‘statement that itself showed racial or gender bias in the [employment]\ndecision’” (emphasis added) (quoting Vatel v. All. of Auto. Mfrs., 627 F.3d 1245, 1247 (D.C. Cir. 2011))); Sims v.\nDist. of Columbia, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1, 9 (D.D.C. 2014) (“[D]irect evidence is ‘a smoking gun showing that the\ndecisionmaker relied upon a protected characteristic in taking an employment action.’” (emphasis in original)\n(quoting PowerComm, LLC v. Holyoke Gas & Elec. Dep’t, 657 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks\nomitted))); Sykes v. Napolitano, 710 F. Supp. 2d 122, 148 (D.D.C. 2010) (“Mr. Sykes fails to demonstrate any nexus\nbetween [an] email [containing a racially derogatory joke] and his own reassignment.”). Accordingly, Ms. Lapera’s\nevidence of discrimination is properly analyzed as only indirect and circumstantial.\n\n                                                         22\n\fissues, which was the sole alleged basis for her non-selection, id. at 29; (3) the hiring process\n\nsuffered so many procedural irregularities as to suggest a discriminatory motive, id. at 29–31;\n\nand (4) Ms. Gehring, who drove the selection decision, harbored significant biases against\n\nHispanic and overweight employees, id. at 10–15, 24–25. These contentions, and the evidence\n\nunderlying them, are reviewed below.\n\n                       a.      The Candidates’ Relative Qualifications\n\n       One way in which a plaintiff can establish pretext is by demonstrating that she was\n\nsignificantly more qualified than the selected applicant. See Hamilton 666, F.3d at 1352;\n\nLathram v. Snow, 336 F.3d 1085, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“There was in fact evidence from\n\nwhich a reasonable juror could conclude that there was a wide and inexplicable gulf between the\n\nqualifications of Boyd and Lathram, and in such circumstances the jury could infer\n\ndiscrimination from the agency’s choice of Boyd over Lathram.”). Here, the parties spill\n\nsignificant ink arguing over whether Ms. Lapera was significantly more qualified for the Vice\n\nPresident of Planning and Alignment position. The position description informs the Court’s\n\nanalysis of the candidates’ relative qualifications.\n\n       The first section of the position description, labeled “Overview of Job,” states that the\n\nVice President of Planning and Alignment is responsible for “facilitat[ing] consensus around a\n\nlong term, integrated execution plan for the restructuring of Fannie Mae and the housing\n\nindustry.” Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. R at 1, ECF No. 14-18. The job overview further states that “this\n\nrole demands intensive interaction with the company’s senior management team, initiative\n\nleaders, [Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”)] and other key stakeholders throughout the\n\ncompany.” Id. The next section of the position description, titled “Key Job Functions and\n\nDuties,” sets out the responsibilities of the Vice President of Planning and Alignment, including:\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f(1) “acting as a trusted advisor” to the SVP of the EPMO and the CFO; (2) “[c]ommunicat[ing]\n\neffectively” about the Multi-Year Investment Plan, in writing and verbally, to the CFO, the\n\nManagement Committee, regulators, and the Fannie Mae Board of Directors by “taking very\n\ncomplex concepts and explaining them in a simple and concise manner;” (3) “manag[ing] the\n\nEPMO’s relationship with key external stakeholders, including FHFA;” (4) “support[ing] the\n\ngoals and objectives of the [] EPMO” and “[b]uild[ing] very strong relationships with the leaders\n\nof each pillar;” (5) “[p]rovid[ing] expert advice and interpretation of corporate governance\n\nactivities.” Id. at 1–2.\n\n        The third section of the job description details the requisite qualifications, including 10\n\nyears of experience (required); 5 years of managerial experience (preferred); expertise in\n\nprogram/project management or related areas; a bachelor’s degree (required); a master’s degree\n\n(preferred); the ability to communicate verbally and in writing with various levels of\n\nmanagement; demonstrated cross-function collaboration; an ability to anticipate and proactively\n\nsolve problems; an ability to influence people to get things done; an ability to apply techniques\n\nfor planning, monitoring, and control programs; and an ability to drive results in a swift and\n\nconstructive manner. Id. at 2. The final section of the job description sets out the broad\n\ncompetencies that applicants should have, essentially repeating, in vaguer terms, the requisite\n\nqualifications outlined in the previous section of the job description. Id.\n\n        Fannie Mae has effectively conceded that Ms. Lapera had “better knowledge and\n\nexperience than Ms. Fraser” as to the substantive areas within the position’s purview. Def.’s\n\nMem. at 21; see also Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 36 at 2, ECF No. 11-36 (interview notes of Mr. Choi,\n\nstating that Ms. Lapera possessed a “working knowledge of the EPMO, specifically the\n\n[Planning and Alignment] team; deep process expertise[;] [and] extensive Fannie Mae\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fexperience and work”). Indeed, Ms. Lapera had long been a member of the EPMO team, Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 31 at 1–2, whereas Ms. Fraser had most recently worked as Vice President for\n\nCorporate Financial Planning and Analysis, Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 30 at 2, ECF No. 11-30. Ms.\n\nLapera reported to the Vice President for Planning and Alignment (Ms. Keller) before she\n\napplied for that position, and at that time she was “performing the vast majority of the duties of\n\nthe VP position” and already managed 24 of the 30 employees on Ms. Keller’s team. Pl.’s\n\nStatement of Disputed Material Facts (“SDMF”) at 10, ECF 14-21. Ms. Lapera also had directed\n\nteams as large as 35 people, see Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 31 at 2, and had mentored and groomed other\n\nemployees, see id. In addition, Ms. Lapera had experience with “cross-function collaboration,”\n\nsee, e.g., id. at 1 (listing in her résumé that she had “[c]reat[ed] partnerships with business and\n\ncorporate support functions (Finance, HR, Business Architecture, and Risk) to deliver results”).\n\nFinally, Ms. Lapera possessed the requisite and preferred educational credentials. Id. at 2.\n\n       Set against this background, Ms. Lapera contends that she was significantly more\n\nqualified for the position of Vice President of Planning and Alignment than the selectee, Ms.\n\nFraser. As for Ms. Fraser’s qualifications, she was already serving as a vice president at Fannie\n\nMae when she was selected for the Vice President of Planning and Alignment position. Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 31 at 2. Like Ms. Lapera, Ms. Fraser had experience with cross-function collaboration\n\nand had groomed her team members for growth. Id. The undisputed evidence indicates that Ms.\n\nFraser had coordinated effectively and extensively with relevant stakeholders, including\n\nregulators, the Board of Directors, and the CEO and CFO. See id.; Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 638–39\n\n(noting Ms. Fraser’s strong relationships with the Fannie Mae CEO and CFO). The evidence\n\nsuggests that Ms. Fraser also possessed many of the “soft” skills listed in the position\n\ndescription. In particular, Ms. Gehring testified that Ms. Fraser possessed strong communication\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fskills and had successfully presented to the regulators and Fannie Mae executives on numerous\n\noccasions. See Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 638–39. Mr. Choi echoed that sentiment in his interview notes,\n\ncommenting that Ms. Fraser “has strong interpersonal and communication skills, which is\n\nimperative.” Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 36 at 2.\n\n       It is ultimately a close question whether a reasonable jury could find that Ms. Lapera was\n\nsignificantly more qualified for the position than Ms. Fraser. Among other things, Ms. Lapera\n\nappears to have had significantly more expertise in the relevant subject matter, more experience\n\nmanaging a large team, and more relevant education than Ms. Fraser. See Hamilton, 666 F.3d at\n\n1356 (“[D]rawing all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiff’s] favor, we believe that a reasonable\n\njury could find that, by comparison to [the selected applicant], [the plaintiff] had much greater\n\ntechnical expertise, more [relevant] experience . . . , and far more formal training.”).\n\nAccordingly, this Court proceeds to consider the other evidence that Ms. Lapera marshals to\n\ndemonstrate that Fannie Mae’s stated reason for selecting Ms. Fraser was pretextual. See id. at\n\n1352 (explaining that it was a “close question” whether the jury would find that the plaintiff was\n\nsignificantly or markedly more qualified than the selected applicant, and therefore proceeding to\n\n“‘review the record taken as a whole’” (quoting Reeves, 530 U.S. at 150)).\n\n                       b.      Whether Ms. Lapera Had Communication Issues\n\n       Ms. Lapera contends that “the evidence in the record and the testimony elicited at\n\narbitration provided no basis upon which a reasonable factfinders could conclude that Ms.\n\nGehring honestly believed Ms. Lapera lacked executive presence” or had communication issues.\n\nPl.’s Opp’n at 29. Fannie Mae disagrees, noting that both Ms. Gehring and another interviewer,\n\nShandell Harris, testified that Ms. Lapera would not be effective in communicating to Fannie\n\nMae executives. During arbitration, when asked why Ms. Lapera was not selected for the\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fposition, Ms. Gehring stated that Ms. Lapera “has difficulties communicating at an executive\n\nlevel. Her written communications are inappropriate and her verbal communications are\n\nsomewhat crass and unpredictable.” Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 613. When pressed for more information,\n\nMs. Gehring explained that Ms. Lapera’s “written communications were somewhat juvenile and\n\ncartoonish and her verbal communications were very unpredictable and she had a negative way\n\nof talking about the organization and its objectives.” Id. at 614–15. Ms. Gehring provided\n\nexamples, noting that Ms. Lapera had second-guessed Fannie Mae’s President’s judgment in a\n\nmeeting with more junior staff and that she “interrupted every single staff meeting” with a\n\n“negative comment.” Id. at 617. Ms. Gehring described Ms. Lapera’s written work product as\n\n“somewhat preachy, juvenile and cartoonish.” Id. at 619 (explaining that Ms. Lapera used clip\n\nart, “and that’s just not appropriate at the executive level”).\n\n       Ms. Harris expressed similar concerns with Ms. Lapera’s communication skills. In her\n\nnotes from Ms. Lapera’s interview, Ms. Harris reported that Ms. Lapera’s “real area of focus\n\nwould be her executive presence and communicating with the OC and MC. I think this area of\n\ndevelopment . . . is critical given this role, so I would not see her as the best candidate.” Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 37 at 1, ECF. No. 11-37. During arbitration, Ms. Harris stated that she told Ms. Lapera\n\nthat her only reservation in selecting Ms. Lapera was her executive presence. Def.’s Arb. Tr. at\n\n478. When asked what she meant by that, Ms. Harris confirmed: “It was a communication style.\n\nSometimes I observed that [Ms. Lapera] could ramble, kind of not be on point. I think it’s\n\nimportant in communicating with executives that you are crisp and to the point and provide\n\ndetail as requested.” Id. Ms. Harris stated that she developed concerns about Ms. Lapera’s\n\ncommunication skills by observing her in staff meetings, where “she tended to be sometimes\n\nemotional in the delivery of her message.” Id. at 479. In sum, then, evidence from two persons\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\finvolved in the selection process indicates that they did not view Ms. Lapera as an effective\n\ncommunicator for senior executives at the company.\n\n       Ms. Lapera, however, disputes Fannie Mae’s evidence with evidence of her own,\n\ncontending that Fannie Mae’s stated rationale that Ms. Lapera had poor communication skills, is\n\nfalse. See Lathram, 336 F.3d at 1089–90 (“In ‘appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can\n\nreasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up\n\na discriminatory purpose.’” (quoting Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147)). First, Ms. Lapera cites her own\n\ntestimony that when she worked for the then-President of Fannie Mae, Mike Williams, around\n\n2008, he “never expressed any concerns with [her] communications.” Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 49. Such\n\nself-serving testimony regarding her own assessment of her superior’s view of her\n\ncommunication skills, standing alone, without corroboration, is not sufficient to raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Fannie Mae decisionmakers actually believed that Ms.\n\nLapera had communication problems. See Burley, 801 F.3d at 298 (“[While] a plaintiff’s own\n\nfirsthand observations of relevant facts are probative evidence[] that [] must not [be] set [] aside\n\nmerely because they come from a party who necessarily has a stake in the outcome,” where\n\ncontrary evidence is present, “the plausibility of those differing observations and inferences is\n\nnot, without more,” sufficient “grounds on which a factfinder reasonably could conclude that”\n\nthe employer’s stated reason “was a pretext for racial discrimination.”); Steele v. Carter, ___ F.\n\nSupp. 3d ___, 2016 WL 3620722, at *16 (D.D.C. June 29, 2016) (“Plaintiff’s own self-\n\nperception of why he was hired—standing alone without corroboration—does not offer any\n\ncredible evidence of discriminatory intent.”); Lawrence v. Lew, 156 F. Supp. 3d 149, 169\n\n(D.D.C. 2015) (“Plaintiff’s self-serving statement that she had the qualifications for GS-11 pay\n\n. . . cannot alone support a genuine dispute as to that fact.”). There is more, however.\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f       First, Ms. Lapera’s coworker, Mr. Tomasello, flatly contradicted Ms. Gehring’s\n\ntestimony that Ms. Lapera was disruptive during staff meetings. Mr. Tomasello testified during\n\narbitration that Ms. Lapera’s comments during meetings were “absolutely” appropriate for the\n\naudience and responded “yes” when asked if Ms. Lapera’s comments were clear. Pl.’s Arb. Tr.\n\nat 711–12. Next, Ms. Lapera notes that her 2012 year-end performance review says nothing\n\nabout communication difficulties. See generally Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. T, ECF No. 11-20. Instead,\n\nthe general tenor of the review is high praise for Ms. Lapera’s work and leadership. See\n\ngenerally id. Although Ms. Gehring testified that she typically does not read performance\n\nreviews and does not recall reading Ms. Lapera’s 2012 review, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 614, the fact\n\nremains that Ms. Lapera’s supervisor did not raise any issues with Ms. Lapera’s communication\n\nskills. Cf. Hamilton, 666 F.3d at 1355 (noting that the absence of contemporaneous evidence in\n\nsupport of the proffered explanation is potentially probative of pretext). In sum, then, it remains\n\nan open question whether Fannie Mae decisionmakers genuinely believed that Ms. Lapera had\n\npoor communication skills. The issue ultimately hinges on a credibility determination—whether\n\nto believe Ms. Gehring and Ms. Harris in light of the competing evidence. This question is\n\nsquarely within the province of a jury.\n\n                       c.     Irregularities in the Hiring Process\n\n       Under certain circumstances, procedural irregularities can support a finding of pretext.\n\nSee Evans v. Sebelius, 716 F.3d 617, 620 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“Employees may cast doubt on the\n\nemployer’s proffered reason by, among other things, pointing to . . . ‘the employer’s failure to\n\nfollow established procedures or criteria . . . .”); Lathram, 336 F.3d at 1093–94 (holding that the\n\nemployer’s decision to open the position to applicants outside the employer’s workforce when it\n\ndid not always do so was evidence of pretext). Here, Ms. Lapera notes that “Ms. Gehring\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fpermitted Ms. Fraser to apply for the vice president position one month after the posting closed,\n\nscheduled her for an interview before she had applied for the position or sent in her resume, and\n\nscheduled her for an hour long interview with Ms. Gehring over lunch, while the other\n\ncandidates were scheduled for half hour interviews in Ms. Gehring’s office.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 30–\n\n31. The evidence on these points is murky.\n\n       Regarding Fannie Mae’s decision to accept Ms. Fraser’s application after the closing date\n\nfor the job posting, Ms. Westwood, the Director of Compensation, was asked during her\n\narbitration testimony whether her office “would typically investigate[] an interview for a vacant\n\nposition where you have a closing date and people are added after that closing date.” Pl.’s Arb.\n\nTr. at 692. Ms. Westwood answered, “No, absolutely not. That happens all the time.” Id.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Werner, who headed the recruitment process for the position, testified that she\n\nmight accept a late application “for any number of reasons, somebody was on vacation, they\n\nmissed a deadline.” Id. at 436 (explaining that Fannie Mae’s practice is to accept applications\n\nvia an online portal but that the formal policy is not so stringent). Ms. Lapera did not introduce\n\nany evidence to call this testimony into question. Thus, it appears that accepting a belated\n\napplication from Ms. Fraser was not actually irregular.\n\n       Another irregularity cited by Ms. Lapera was scheduling Ms. Fraser for an interview\n\nbefore receiving her application, but evidence regarding whether this chronology was unusual is\n\nminimal. See Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 440 (discussing who decided to interview Ms. Fraser before she\n\nsubmitted her application but not stating whether that was atypical). Fannie Mae posits that the\n\nevidence is inconclusive as to whether it was inappropriate for Ms. Gehring to conduct Ms.\n\nFraser’s interview over lunch and for a longer period of time than the other interviews, which\n\nwere conducted in Ms. Gehring’s office. Def.’s Reply Mem. at 19. Ms. Werner initially testified\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fthat she was not sure whether an interviewer would typically take only one candidate to lunch\n\nbut thought that such activity might vary based on schedule and availability. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at\n\n444. Shortly thereafter though, Ms. Werner was asked, “Would [it] be improper for a lunch\n\ninterview for just one applicant and not the other applicants?” Id. at 445. Ms. Werner responded\n\n“[y]es” and also stated that when she had conducted a lunch interview in the past, she did so for\n\nall applicants. Id. She further stated that interviews should be the same length of time, while\n\nalso testifying that “there could be many factors that influence why interviews go long.” Id. at\n\n445–46.\n\n       Consideration of all this evidence indicates that at least some of the cited “irregularities”\n\nare, in fact, not uncommon at Fannie Mae and therefore not probative of pretext. Nevertheless, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude, based on Ms. Werner’s shifting responses to the questions about\n\nlunch interviews and interview durations, that something was amiss, which adds at least\n\nmarginally to the evidence supporting a finding of pretext.\n\n                      d.      Ms. Gehring’s Biases\n\n       Finally, Ms. Lapera points to evidence suggesting that Ms. Gehring was biased against\n\nHispanic and overweight employees. Pl.’s Opp’n at 10–15, 24–25. Such evidence, if believed\n\nby a jury, can be probative of pretext. Evans, 716 F.3d at 620 (explaining that pretext can be\n\nshown by, among other things, “‘[an] employer’s general treatment of minority employees; or\n\ndiscriminatory statements by the decisionmaker’” (quoting Brady, 520 F.3d at 495)).\n\n       According to Ms. Lapera’s testimony, Ms. Gehring targeted overweight employees and\n\nHispanic employees from the beginning of her tenure as Senior Vice President. In September of\n\n2012, when Ms. Gehring first became Senior Vice President, she called a town hall meeting.\n\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 110–11. After the meeting, Ms. Gehring called Ms. Lapera and said that the\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fbusiness architecture team managed by Ms. Lapera is “going to have a long way to go to be able\n\nto represent EPMO the way I want it represented.” Id. at 111. According to Ms. Lapera, Ms.\n\nGehring specifically mentioned Blythe Neumiller, Patricia Brumbaugh, and Dina Purcell, all\n\nthree of whom to varying degrees are overweight. Id. at 112–13. Ms. Neumiller was the largest\n\nmember of the team and was so overweight that she had trouble walking, id. at 112, and, during a\n\nstaff meeting, Ms. Gehring commented to a group of employees that Ms. Neumiller “waddles”\n\nwhile she walks, id. When Ms. Neumiller later left the team, evidently due to concern about her\n\ncareer prospects under Ms. Gehring’s leadership, Ms. Gehring allegedly “congratulated [Ms.\n\nLapera] on getting [Ms. Neumiller] to move voluntarily to the other team,” notwithstanding the\n\nlack of issues with Ms. Neumiller’s performance. Id. at 115–16.\n\n       Also after the town hall meeting, Ms. Gehring allegedly told Ms. Lapera that she “could\n\nsee [Ms. Brumbaugh’s] tummy from where [she] was sitting” and then instructed Ms. Lapera\n\nthat her team needed to start “dressing up better.” Id. at 113. In December of 2012, Ms. Lapera\n\nconducted her semi-annual performance ratings of her staff and recommended that Ms.\n\nBrumbaugh receive a rating of a “2” 18 to reflect “the amazing deliverables that she produced that\n\nparticular year.” Id. at 132–33. Although Ms. Gehring agreed that Ms. Brumbaugh’s work was\n\nstrong, she stated that Ms. Brumbaugh lacked “executive presence” and did not have the “look”\n\nthat team members should have. Id. at 133–34. Accordingly, Ms. Gehring downgraded Ms.\n\nBrumbaugh’s rating to a “3.” Id. 135.\n\n       Ms. Lapera also cites Ms. Gehring’s treatment of Ms. Keller. Ms. Lapera testified that, in\n\nApril 2013 at a staff meeting, Ms. Gehring told Ms. Keller that she too used to be overweight\n\nand could help Ms. Keller achieve her weight loss goals. Id. at 138. Ms. Gehring then turned to\n\n\n\n18\n       A rating of “2” equated to “exceeds expectations.” Id. at 132.\n\n                                                       32\n\fMs. Lapera and told Ms. Lapera that she “could look better too.” Id. Ms. Keller left her position\n\nshortly after the April 2013 staff meeting. Id. at 140. Finally, Ms. Lapera points out that Ms.\n\nGehring arranged for an image consultant to come to Fannie Mae to speak with her subordinates\n\nabout image improvement. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 118–29. Ms. Lapera and Mr. Tomasello testified\n\nthat Ms. Gehring pressured the EPMO staff to attend the class, where the consultant told the\n\nwomen that they should wear make-up and avoid wearing colors that clash with their skin and\n\ncolor their gray hair. Id. at 122–24; id. at 714 (“Q. And what was the emphasis on at that image\n\nconsulting session? A. Aesthetics. Mostly, you know, not delivering results, but, you know,\n\nwear a coat, wear a suit and tie if you’re a man, make sure you have well-pressed clothes, your\n\nhair combed, wear the proper level of make-up.”).\n\n       Ms. Lapera’s evidence of Ms. Gehring’s bias against Hispanic employees is less robust,\n\nbut it is there. Ms. Lapera relies on her own testimony that Ms. Gehring commented that a\n\nHispanic employee, Shirley Cruz Rodriguez, would “need to work on [her] accent because there\n\nis no way she’s going to progress with an accent like the one she has.” Id. at 137. Ms. Lapera\n\ntestified that Ms. Rodriguez’s accent did not affect her performance evaluation but that Ms.\n\nGehring made clear that “unless [Ms. Rodriguez’s] accent changed, she [would] not have any []\n\nopportunities for promotion.” Id.\n\n       To be sure, the testimony about Ms. Gehring’s statements about Hispanic and overweight\n\nemployees is disputed. Ms. Gehring denies having made the comments, see Def.’s Reply Mem.\n\nat 18 & n.3, and even if she did, some are susceptible of innocent interpretations, such as Ms.\n\nGehring’s offer to help Ms. Keller lose weight. If believed, however, this testimony permits the\n\ninference that Ms. Gehring held negative views of Hispanic and overweight employees, and a\n\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fjury could infer that Ms. Gehring acted upon those views in declining to select Ms. Lapera for\n\nthe Vice President of Planning and Alignment position.\n\n                                                     ***\n\n       Although a close call, reviewing the record as a whole, Ms. Lapera has produced\n\nsufficient evidence to create a genuine issue as to whether Fannie Mae’s rationale for selecting\n\nMs. Fraser for the Vice President of Planning and Alignment position was pretextual. “In the\n\nend, the record supports two plausible interpretations of what happened.” Evans, 716 F.3d at\n\n622. One view is that Ms. Gehring, who drove the hiring process, harbored biases toward\n\nHispanic and overweight employees and selected Ms. Fraser not because she was more qualified\n\nbut because she fit the mold in terms of demographics and personal appearance that Ms. Gerhing\n\npreferred. The other view is that, notwithstanding her subject matter expertise, Ms. Lapera\n\nsimply lacked the requisite communication skills to be effective in the Vice President of\n\nPlanning and Alignment role. Ultimately, a jury will get to choose between these “competing\n\nviews.” Id.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Fannie Mae’s motion for summary judgment is granted in part\n\nand denied in part. Specifically, this motion is granted as to all of Ms. Lapera’s age\n\ndiscrimination claims as well as her salary leveling claims. The motion is denied as to Ms.\n\nLapera’s non-selection claims alleging racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and racial\n\nand personal-appearance discrimination under the DCHRA.

Human Rights Act (“DCHRA”), D.C. Code Ann. § 2-1401 et seq. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 1, 4, ECF No. 1-1. These claims are predicated on Ms. Lapera’s allegations that Fannie Mae\n\nimproperly classified her position’s salary grade (and rejected Ms. Lapera’s subsequent requests\n\nto relevel her salary grade), and declined to promote her on the basis of her race, age, and\n\nphysical appearance. Pending before the Court is Fannie Mae’s motion for summary judgment.\n\nDef.’s Mot. Summ. J. (“Def.’s MSJ”), ECF No. 11. For the reasons set forth below, this motion\n\nis granted in part and denied in part. Specifically, while Ms. Lapera has shown no genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to whether Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her race or\n\npersonal appearance when it leveled her salary, she has adduced sufficient evidence to raise such\n\nan issue with respect to whether Fannie Mae’s proffered reason for passing over Ms. Lapera for\n\nthe position of Vice President of Planning and Alignment was pretextual.\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fI.       BACKGROUND\n\n         The pertinent factual and procedural history for consideration of the pending motion for\n\nsummary judgment is summarized below.\n\n         A.       Facts\n\n         Ms. Lapera was born in Caracas, Venezuela, Plaintiff’s Arbitration Transcript (“Pl.’s\n\nArb. Tr.”) at 28, ECF No. 14-1, 1 and describes herself as having “a body size which may be\n\nperceived by some as being overweight,” Compl. ¶ 6. She holds a degree in systems engineering\n\nfrom a school in Venezuela as well as a master’s degree in engineering administration from\n\nGeorge Washington University. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 29. Ms. Lapera was employed by Fannie Mae,\n\n“a private, shareholder-owned company chartered by Congress,” Def.’s Statement of Undisputed\n\nFacts (“Def.’s SUF”) ¶ 1, ECF No. 11-1, in various positions for almost twenty years, from 1994\n\nthrough 2013, Pl.’s Arb Tr. at 29. Her career path at Fannie Mae is generally described below.\n\n                  1.       Ms. Lapera’s Early Career at Fannie Mae\n\n         Fannie Mae hired Ms. Lapera in 1994 to work as a manager in the advanced technology\n\ndivision of the IT department. Id. at 30. From there, Ms. Lapera transitioned to a development\n\nmanager position, and then to a position in which she helped coordinate a smooth technological\n\ntransition into the year 2000. Id. at 31. Thereafter, she was promoted to various Director-level\n\npositions. Id. at 41. For example, in 2008, Fannie Mae’s President selected Ms. Lapera to head\n\n\n\n\n1\n         Pursuant to Ms. Lapera’s employment contract, she initially brought the instant claims before an arbitrator\nin November 2014. Def.’s SUF ¶ 98. As described in more detail, infra Part I.B., the arbitration hearing involved\nthe examination of witnesses by both sides and resulted in an arbitral award in favor of Fannie Mae. Under the\nterms of the employment contract, the arbitral decision is in no way binding on this Court. See Fannie Mae Dispute\nResolution Policy (“DRP”) at ¶ 14, ECF No. 16-2 (“If the employee rejects the Award, it will not become binding\non the employee or the Company, and the employee may bring suit on the claim at his or her own expense.”). Both\nparties have submitted portions of the transcript from the arbitration hearing as factual support for their arguments in\nconnection with the pending summary judgment motion.\n\n                                                           2\n\fthe restructuring of operations and IT at Fannie Mae. Id. at 46. Then, in 2009, Ms. Lapera was\n\nselected to direct the new Lean Six Sigma team. 2 Id. at 49–50.\n\n                  2.       Ms. Lapera’s New Salary Grade\n\n         In June 2009, Fannie Mae adopted a new salary scale for employees. Whereas salary\n\ngrades had previously been on a numerical scale, the new scale was alphabetical, with letters\n\nlater in the alphabet corresponding to a higher salary. As the Director of Lean Six Sigma, Ms.\n\nLapera’s salary grade shifted from a “6” to an “M.” Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 524–25; Decl. of Ana\n\nLapera (“Lapera Decl.”) ¶ 7, ECF No. 14-2. At the same time, employees whom Ms. Lapera\n\nperceived to be her professional peers received higher salary grades of “N,” Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 85;\n\nher direct reports received salary grades of “M” and “L,” id. at 92; and several individuals who\n\nallegedly had less responsibility than Ms. Lapera received a salary grade of “N,” Decl. of Ana\n\nLapera ¶ 8. Moreover, Fannie Mae posted an available position that required less education and\n\nexperience than Ms. Lapera’s position and stated that the position would command an “N” grade\n\nsalary. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 93–97.\n\n         On July 18, 2009, Ms. Lapera emailed her manager, Claude Wade, to explain why she\n\nbelieved that her position was assigned an improperly low salary grade and to request an “N”\n\ngrade salary. 3 Id. at 86. In response, Mr. Wade advised Ms. Lapera that he had inquired with\n\nthe human resources department and was informed that the “M” salary grade for her position\n\nwould stand. Id. at 87. Ms. Lapera requested a salary upgrade to level “N” again in April 2011,\n\n\n\n2\n         As described by Ms. Lapera during arbitration, Lean Six Sigma is a “process improvement methodology.”\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 50. “Lean” refers to “reduc[ing] waste” and “looking at everything from the customer perspective.”\nId. “Six Sigma” refers to “us[ing] statistics to make sure that you always g[e]t the output that your customer wants.”\nId. “So when you combine the two methodologies, it can be very, very powerful to streamline a company, to\nstreamline operations, and to make sure that the output . . . is exactly [right].” Id.\n3\n         Ms. Lapera surmises, based on her employee compensation statements, that the “M” salary range was\n$112,000 to $194,000, and the “N” salary range was $129,000 to $222,000.

K,\n\nECF No. 14-11. In 2012, Fannie Mae increased Ms. Lapera’s salary by $28,000, however, as\n\npart of the Promotion and Equity Process (“PEP”), which managers can use to that their\n\nsubordinates’ salaries be increased based on performance. Def.’s Arbitration Transcript (“Def.’s\n\nArb. Tr.”) at 571, ECF No. 11-3.\n\n                 3.       Fannie Mae’s Non-Selection of Ms. Lapera for Vice President\n\n        In September 2012, Anne Gehring, who at that time worked in the Financial Planning and\n\nAnalysis division, was selected to be Senior Vice President of the Enterprise Program\n\nManagement Office (“EPMO”). Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 102–03. 4 As relevant in this case, Ms. Gehring\n\nconsistently emphasized that employees in her department should have “executive presence,” see\n\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 714, a term she did not explicitly define. The parties dispute the meaning of the\n\nterm: Fannie Mae contends that the term “executive presence” “is widely used in business\n\ncircles to describe the ability to project mature self-confidence, a sense that you can take control\n\nof difficult, unpredictable situations; make tough decisions in a timely way and hold your own\n\nwith other talented and strong-willed members of the executive team.” Def.’s Mem. Supp. Mot.\n\nDismiss (“Def.’s Mem.”) at 22, ECF 11-2 (internal quotation marks omitted). Ms. Lapera, on\n\nthe other hand, contends that Ms. Gehring used the term “to criticize the appearance of\n\noverweight, older, and minority Fannie Mae employees.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 2; id. at 12 (“[Ms.\n\nGehring] consistently characterized employees who were not Caucasian, young, and slender as\n\nlacking ‘executive presence.’”). One Fannie Mae employee, Jim Tomasello, testified during\n\narbitration as follows:\n\n             So the term “executive presence” was a theme that [Ms. Gehring] beat the\n             drum on regularly and, really, from the beginning of the time that she was\n\n4\n      The arbitrator opined that, “[b]y virtually all accounts, Ms. Gehring was a brash and unpopular executive.”\nJAMS Arbitration Award (“Arbitration Award”) at 3, ECF No. 11-41.\n\n                                                        4\n\f           over the EPMO. It was a bar that she never really explained but was\n           talked about, you know, being able to be put in front of executives and\n           basically evaluated people based off of that. We as a group were sent to\n           an image training session where a consultant was brought in to speak\n           specifically about what executive presence meant and what it would take\n           for individuals to, in addition to delivering results, would have to exude to\n           be able to be considered, you know, for promotion or a well-performing\n           employee.\n\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 714.\n\n       As for Ms. Gehring’s treatment of employees, Ms. Lapera’s describes a disconcerting\n\npattern of comments and behavior. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 14 (“Ms. Gehring began to regularly use\n\n[two co-workers] as examples of employees who did not ‘fit the team’s image’. . . and criticized\n\n‘the way they conduct[ed] themselves’, ‘the way they s[a]t’, and the way ‘their tummies\n\nsometimes show[ed].’”); Pl.’s Opp’n at 10, ECF No. 14. (“Ms. Gehring immediately began to\n\ntarget employees who did not meet her standard of an ideal personal appearance, which was\n\nCaucasian, young, and slender.”). Ms. Lapera testified during arbitration that, among other\n\nthings, Ms. Gehring (1) transferred a Hispanic female to a different group, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 105–\n\n08; (2) frequently criticized the personal appearance of her subordinates, id. at 110–13\n\n(explaining that Ms. Gehring chided one overweight employee for “waddling” in front of the\n\ndirectors and commented that another overweight woman had her midriff exposed at work), id. at\n\n137–39; (3) pressured staff to attend a class put on by an image consultant, id. at 118–29;\n\n(4) regularly commented that she ate only a yogurt and banana for breakfast to keep her weight\n\ndown and that other employees should do the same, id. at 139; and (5) in conducting employee\n\nreviews, took an employee’s appearances and another employee’s accent into account, id. at\n\n133–35.\n\n       Less than one year after Ms. Gehring became Senior Vice President, one of her\n\nsubordinates, Kathy Keller, who was Vice President of EPMO Planning and Alignment and Ms.\n\n                                                 5\n\fLapera’s direct supervisor, left her position after Ms. Gehring “communicated to Kathy that it\n\nwasn’t working out and instructed her to look for opportunities elsewhere in Fannie Mae.” Id. at\n\n142–43; id. at 606. 5 On June 3, 2013, Fannie Mae solicited applications to fill Ms. Keller’s\n\nposition. Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. M, ECF No. 14-13. Ms. Lapera applied. Id., Ex. O, ECF No. 14-15.\n\nBefore the job was posted, Ms. Gehring noted that Joe Hallet, a Caucasian male already\n\nemployed at Fannie Mae, might be a good candidate to fill the open position, and he applied for\n\nthe position. Id., Ex. N, ECF No. 14-14. 6 A third candidate, Nicola Fraser, did not initially\n\napply, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 426–27, but after the formal deadline to apply had expired, Ms. Fraser,\n\nwho was then a Vice President on maternity leave, Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 238, had dinner with Ms.\n\nGehring and discussed the opening. Id. at 332; Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 28, ECF No. 11-28. Ms. Fraser\n\nthen submitted her résumé to the Human Resources Department. Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 431; Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 30, ECF No. 11-30.\n\n         All three candidates were interviewed by Shandell Harris from the Human Resources\n\nDepartment, Mike Choi, a Vice President in EPMO, and Ms. Gehring. Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 34, ECF\n\nNo. 11-34. Ms. Fraser was ultimately selected to fill the Vice President of EPMO Planning and\n\nAlignment position. Lapera Decl. ¶ 24; Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 152. Ms. Gehring relayed Fannie Mae’s\n\nhiring decision to Ms. Lapera in a face-to-face meeting. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 152. Several months\n\nlater, Ms. Lapera left Fannie Mae and became a consultant. Def.’s SUF ¶ 96.\n\n\n\n\n5\n          A human resources employee testified that Ms. Keller was not asked to resign from her position. See Pl.’s\nArb. Tr. at 467 (“Q. Was Ms. Keller asked to resign from her position? A. No. Q. And how do you know Ms.\nKeller was not asked to resign from her position? A. Because Ms. Keller came to me and asked me for a package.”).\n6\n          Ms. Gehring flatly denied having pre-selected Mr. Hallet for the position during her arbitration testimony.\nSee Pl.’s Arb.

[D]id you communicate to individuals in human resources that you wanted to place\nJoe Hallet in the position and you wanted to find out what was needed to get him through the process . . . ?

Procedural History\n\n       Ms. Lapera pursued her claims in nonbinding arbitration as required by her employment\n\nagreement. See generally Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 40 (“Demand for Arbitration”), ECF No. 11-40.\n\nFollowing an opportunity for discovery, the parties participated in a four-day hearing before the\n\narbitrator, during which the parties presented witness testimony subject to cross-examination,\n\nsubmitted documentary evidence, and filed post-hearing briefs. See JAMS Arbitration Award\n\n(“Arbitration Award”) at 2, ECF No. 11-41. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Fannie Mae. Id. at\n\n6. As to Ms. Lapera’s racial discrimination claims, the arbitrator found that “no evidence [] of\n\nrace discrimination was adduced during the four days of trial.” Id. at 2. As for Ms. Lapera’s\n\nclaim that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on account of her personal appearance in\n\nrefusing to relevel her salary grade, the arbitrator concluded that “the . . . record demonstrates an\n\norderly and regular, if slow, process that ultimately resulted in a significant salary increase for\n\nMs. Lapera,” and that “[n]o evidence or even hint of discrimination appears [in the] record.” Id.\n\nat 3. Finally, the arbitrator rejected Ms. Lapera’s non-promotion claim, finding that Ms. Lapera\n\nhad not proven that Fannie Mae’s proffered non-discriminatory reason for selecting Ms. Fraser\n\nwas pretextual. Id. at 6 (“All of Ms[.] Lapera’s testimony about Ms[.] Gehring’s treatment of\n\nother employees was anecdotal, and most of it was either uncorroborated or disputed. Most\n\nimportantly, however: except for Ms[.] Lapera’s testimony about her own belief and her own\n\nself-image, there was no evidence in the record that anyone said, thought, or acted upon a\n\nperception that Ms[.] Lapera herself was overweight, or improperly dressed, or possessed of an\n\nunattractive body shape.”).\n\n       As allowed under Fannie Mae’s Dispute Resolution Policy, Ms. Lapera rejected the\n\narbitral award and filed a complaint in D.C. Superior Court on January 27, 2015. See Fannie\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fMae Dispute Resolution Policy (“DRP”) at ¶ 14, ECF No. 16-2 (“The employee may, within 30\n\ncalendar days of the date of issuance of the Award, reject it, in its entirety, by sending a\n\ncompleted ‘Rejection of Arbitration Award’ form to JAMS and [Fannie Mae’s Compliance and\n\nEthics Department].”); see also generally Compl. Fannie Mae removed the action to this Court\n\non March 27, 2015. See generally Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.\n\n       Ms. Lapera’s complaint asserts two claims against Fannie Mae under the DCHRA and\n\n§ 1981. In Count I, Ms. Lapera contends that Fannie Mae violated the DCHRA by “knowingly\n\nand intentionally engag[ing] in unlawful discrimination against [Ms. Lapera] based on her race,\n\nage and personal appearance” by, inter alia, assigning Ms. Lapera’s position of Director of Lean\n\nSix Sigma a salary grade of “M” and denying Ms. Lapera a promotion to the position of Vice\n\nPresident of EPMO Planning and Alignment. Compl. ¶ 30. Similarly, in Count II, Ms. Lapera\n\ncontends that Fannie Mae violated § 1981 by “knowingly and intentionally subject[ing] [Ms.\n\nLapera] to discrimination based on her race, Hispanic American, when [Fannie Mae] failed to\n\nreclassify her position properly form [sic] 2009 through 2012 . . . ; discriminated against her in\n\nthe evaluation of her performance . . . ; and denied Ms. Lapera a promotion to the position of\n\nVice President of Planning and Alignment . . . .” Id. ¶ 35. As relief, Ms. Lapera seeks a\n\ndeclaration that Fannie Mae violated the DCHRA and § 1981; a permanent injunction\n\nprohibiting Fannie Mae from engaging in any discriminatory employment practices; back pay\n\nand front pay in an amount to be determined at trial; an order prohibiting Fannie Mae from\n\nretaliating against Ms. Lapera or any other person for participating in this case; compensatory\n\nand punitive damages in amounts to be determined by an arbitrator; reasonable attorneys’ fees,\n\nexpert fees, and costs; and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.

DISCUSSION\n\n       Ms. Lapera asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her age,\n\nrace, and personal appearance by leveling her salary at the “M” level and by selecting a different\n\ncandidate for the Vice President of Planning and Alignment position. These claims are\n\naddressed seriatim below after first explaining the applicable legal framework.\n\n       A.      Statutory Overview\n\n               1.      Section 1981\n\n       Section 1981 guarantees the rights of all persons, regardless of their race, to “make and\n\nenforce contracts.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). The statute defines the phrase “make and enforce\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fcontracts” as “including the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts,\n\nand the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual\n\nrelationship.” Id. § 1981(b). A plaintiff asserting an employment discrimination claim under\n\n§ 1981 “must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the actions taken by the\n\nemployer were ‘more likely than not based on the consideration of . . . race.’” Pollard v.

As relevant here, the DCHRA expressly\n\nprovides that an employer may not “fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge, any individual; or\n\notherwise to discriminate against any individual, with respect to his compensation, terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment, including promotion; or to limit, segregate, or classify\n\nhis employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities, or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.” D.C.

That is, in the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, the Court\n\nemploys McDonnell Douglas to decide whether a plaintiff has marshaled enough evidence to\n\ntake her claims to a jury. Olatunji, 958 F. Supp. 2d at 31.\n\n        B.        Ms. Lapera’s Age Discrimination Claims\n\n        Ms. Lapera’s complaint asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of\n\nher age in violation of the DCHRA by (1) classifying her position at the “M” salary grade and\n\ndenying her subsequent requests to relevel her salary grade, and (2) failing to promote her to the\n\nposition of Vice President of EPMO Planning and Alignment. Compl. ¶¶ 11–12, 23. Fannie\n\nMae contends that it is “entitled to judgment as a matter of law on [Ms. Lapera’s] age\n\ndiscrimination claims brought under the DCHRA because they were not first arbitrated as\n\nrequired by Fannie Mae’s Dispute Resolution Policy (the ‘DRP’).” Def.’s Mem. at 4. Fannie\n\nMae is correct.\n\n        The arbitration policy governing Ms. Lapera’s employment relationship with Fannie Mae\n\nunambiguously provides that an employee “must arbitrate” “all claims . . . against Fannie Mae\n\n. . . involving a legally-protected right, that directly or indirectly relate to . . . employment”\n\n“before bringing suit . . . in court.” DRP ¶¶ 1–2. Among the claims that an employee must\n\narbitrate before proceeding to court are “claims involving rights protected by . . . federal[] [and]\n\nstate . . . law.” Id. ¶ 2. Consequently, if, as Fannie Mae asserts, Ms. Lapera did not first arbitrate\n\nher age-discrimination claims, then this Court is not empowered to adjudicate such claims. See\n\nNat’l R.R.

Indeed, all three counts asserted in\n\nher Demand for Arbitration “sounded in race or personal appearance discrimination.” Def.’s\n\nReply Supp. Mot.

See Pl.’s Opp’n at 38–41. First, she contends that she\n\nadequately alleged age discrimination because her Demand for Arbitration referenced her age as\n\nwell as the age of the selectee, Ms. Fraser. Id. at 38–39.

See, e.g., Skrynnikov v. Fed. Nat’l Mortg. Ass’n, 943 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 172, 177–78 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that the DPR’s “broad and inclusive language”\n\ndoes not render the agreement unenforceable). Accordingly, Ms. Lapera’s conceded failure to\n\npursue any age-discrimination claims in arbitration forecloses her attempt to do so here. 7\n\n        C.       Ms. Lapera’s Race and Personal-Appearance Discrimination Claims\n\n        As for her remaining discrimination claims, which are properly before this Court, Ms.\n\nLapera contends that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her race and personal\n\nappearance by (1) classifying her position at the “M” salary grade, and (2) failing to promote her\n\nto the position of Vice President of EPMO Planning and Alignment. 8 Before turning to Ms.\n\nLapera’s claims arising out of each incident, the parties’ arguments as to whether Ms. Lapera’s\n\nHispanic identity qualifies as race within the meaning of § 1981 are addressed first.\n\n\n\n\n7\n          Thus Fannie Mae’s alternative argument that Ms. Lapera’s age-discrimination claims are barred by the\nDCHRA’s statute of limitations, see Def.’s Mem. at 10; Def.’s Reply at 7–8, need not be addressed.\n8\n          Ms. Lapera’s DCHRA and § 1981 racial discrimination claims are addressed together since, as noted, supra\nPart III.A., the same standard applies.\n\n                                                       15\n\f                  1.        Hispanic Ethnicity is a Race for Purposes of § 1981\n\n         Section 1981 “forbid[s] all ‘racial’ discrimination in the making of private as well as\n\npublic contracts.” Saint Francis College v.

Humphries, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145806\"><a href=\"/opinion/145806/cbocs-west-inc-v-humphries/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 459 n.1 (2008). Fannie Mae argues that § 1981\n\n“does not provide a cause of action for [Ms. Lapera’s] theories of discrimination based on her\n\n. . . alleged Hispanic national origin.” Def.’s Mem. at 6 (emphasis added). Ms. Lapera responds\n\nthat “District of Columbia courts have overwhelmingly recognized claims of race, ethnic and\n\nnational origin discrimination under Section 1981 based on a plaintiff’s Hispanic identity.” Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n at 35 (collecting cases). While not entirely clear whether Fannie Mae’s position is that\n\nHispanic ethnicity is not a race for purposes of § 1981 or that Ms. Lapera’s racial discrimination\n\nclaims rely on her country of origin rather than her race, either way, Fannie Mae’s argument\n\nfails.\n\n         After the parties submitted their briefing in this case, the Second Circuit addressed the\n\nissue whether Hispanic is a race under § 1981. See Village of Freeport v. Barrella, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">594</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600–10 (2d Cir. 2016). In Village of Freeport, the defendant–employer defended against\n\nthe plaintiff–employee’s § 1981 and Title VII claims on the ground that Hispanic is not a distinct\n\nrace from Caucasian and, accordingly, the Hispanic plaintiff and his Caucasian coworker “are\n\nboth white in the estimation of federal antidiscrimination statutes, and [the government\n\nofficial’s] decision to promote one white candidate rather than another could not have constituted\n\nracial discrimination.” 9 Id. at 601. The Second Circuit roundly rejected that argument, finding\n\nthat “it has been clear since the Reagan Administration that § 1981 bars employers from\n\n\n9\n         Village of Freeport had a slightly different posture than this case, as the plaintiff there was an Italian-\nAmerican (i.e., Caucasian) and argued that the defendant had hired a less qualified Hispanic for the position of\npolice chief. Id. at 598. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit plainly held that “discrimination based on Hispanic\nancestry or lack thereof constitutes racial discrimination under that statute.” Id.\n\n                                                           16\n\fdiscriminating based on Hispanic ethnicity or lack thereof.” Id. at 609; see also id. at 598 (“[W]e\n\nreiterate that ‘race’ includes ethnicity for purposes of § 1981, so that discrimination based on\n\nHispanic ancestry or lack thereof constitutes racial discrimination under that statute.”); Pavon v.\n\nSwift Transp. Co., Inc.,192 F.3d 902, 908 (9th Cir. 1999) (rejecting the argument that\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of being Hispanic is not actionable under § 1981 and upholding the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling in favor of the Hispanic plaintiff).\n\n        The Second Circuit’s decision is persuasive and has unequivocal support in the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decision in Saint Francis College, 481 U.S. at 613. There, the Supreme Court addressed\n\nthe question “whether a person of Arabian ancestry was protected from racial discrimination\n\nunder § 1981.” Id. at 607. In so doing, the Court considered the common understanding of race\n\nat the time that § 1981 was enacted (as found in dictionaries and encyclopedias) as well as the\n\nlegislative history of § 1981, “which . . . had its source in the Civil Rights Act of 1866 [and] the\n\nVoting Rights Act of 1870.” Id. at 610–13. The Court found that “dictionaries commonly\n\nreferred to race as a ‘continued series of descendants from a parent who is called the stock,” id. at\n\n610 (quoting N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 666 (New York\n\n1860) (emphasis in original)), and that “[e]ncyclopedias of the 19th century also described race\n\nin terms of ethnic groups,” id. at 611 (providing as examples “Finns,” “gypsies,” “Basques,”\n\n“Hebrews,” and many others). The legislative history “reflect[ed] this [] understanding” of race.\n\nId. at 612. “Based on the history of § 1981,” the Court had “little trouble in concluding that\n\nCongress intended to protect from discrimination identifiable classes of persons who are\n\nsubjected to intentional discrimination solely because of their ancestry or ethnic characteristics.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). Accordingly, no legitimate dispute remains that Hispanic ethnicity is a\n\nrace for purposes of § 1981.\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f         Likewise, any argument by Fannie Mae that Ms. Lapera has alleged discrimination on the\n\nbasis of her country of origin, rather than her Hispanic race, fails. No reasonable reading of Ms.\n\nLapera’s complaint or papers suggests that she believes she was discriminated against on account\n\nof her Venezuelan national origin. Ms. Lapera has consistently stated that she was discriminated\n\nagainst based on her Hispanic ethnicity. Thus, because Hispanic is a race for purposes of § 1981\n\nand because Ms. Lapera’s complaint alleges that she was discriminated against based upon her\n\nHispanic ethnicity, her racial discrimination claims are legally cognizable.\n\n                  2.        Salary Leveling Claims\n\n         Ms. Lapera asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of her race and\n\npersonal appearance when the company releveled salaries and assigned her position, Director of\n\nLean Six Sigma, the salary grade of “M” rather than “N,” and then rejected her requests to\n\nchange her salary grade to an “N.” Fannie Mae contends that Ms. Lapera fails to make out a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination with this claim but that even if she had, Fannie Mae had\n\n“legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons” for declining to relevel Ms. Lapera’s position’s salary.\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 10.\n\n         In opposing summary judgment on her salary leveling claim, Ms. Lapera focuses\n\nexclusively on her prima facie case, arguing that several facts give rise to an inference of\n\ndiscrimination. 10 See Pl.’s Opp’n at 32–34. Problematically for Ms. Lapera, however, Fannie\n\nMae has proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation as to why it initially assigned her\n\nposition an “M” salary grade and why her subsequent requests for releveling were denied. See\n\n\n\n\n10\n          Ms. Lapera points to the fact that “Fannie Mae employees with similar qualifications and duties outside her\nprotected classes were classified at level ‘N’” and that her peers with “significantly less responsibility . . . were also\nclassified under an ‘N’ salary grade.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 33. Furthermore, one of Ms. Lapera’s direct reports received\nher same salary grade of “M.” Id. at 34. Finally, postings for positions with “fewer responsibilities and\nqualification requirements than Ms. Lapera’s position were also posted at higher levels than her position.” Id.\n\n                                                           18\n\fAdeyemi v.

In particular, Fannie Mae has asserted that its Compensation Department assigned all\n\npositions’ salary grades by looking at market wages for a given job description and then slotting\n\nthat position into the appropriate salary grade. 11 See Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 525 (“[T]he structure was\n\nbuilt based on available market data. There are companies that produce compensation surveys\n\nand that’s how we get our market data. . . . We use market data for positions to determine the\n\ngrade level . . . .”). Critically, the Compensation Department did not consider in any way the\n\ncharacteristics or performance of the individual who occupied a given position. Id. at 531\n\n(explaining that the leveling “wasn’t related to performance in any way . . . [and it] didn’t\n\nconsider the individual”); id. at 558–59 (“[W]hen we’re levelling positions, we are not looking at\n\nindividuals. We are looking at the position itself.”); id. at 566 (“The position levelling work that\n\nwe do isn’t based on the individual person.”). 12\n\n         Fannie Mae likewise offered a nondiscriminatory explanation as to why Ms. Lapera’s\n\nsubsequent requests to relevel her position’s salary grade were denied. As for her first request in\n\nApril 2009, Ms. Lapera consulted her supervisor, Claude Wade, to ask whether her position was\n\neligible for a salary upgrade. Mr. Wade inquired with the Compensation Department, and the\n\nCompensation Department determined that a change was not appropriate, apparently because the\n\n\n\n11\n          It is true that Fannie Mae supervisors interfaced with the Compensation Department to help the individual\ntasked with leveling a position understand the responsibilities and nature of that position, see Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 532–\n33, but Ms. Lapera does not assert that her job description was inaccurate.\n12\n          Ms. Lapera summarily takes issue with these statements in her Statement of Disputed Material Facts, see\nPl.’s Statement of Disputed Material Facts (“SDMF”) at 4–5, ECF No. 14-21, but points to no evidence in the record\nto refute the evidence showing that the salary grades were assigned based on objective markers and data.\n\n                                                          19\n\fsalary grade had just been leveled and there was no obvious reason to change it. See Pl.’s Arb.\n\nTr. at 535–36. 13 As for the second request, Shandell Harris (“Ms. Harris”), a human resources\n\nbusiness partner, id. at 462, emailed the Director of Compensation, Nicole Harris Westwood\n\n(“Ms. Westwood” 14), in the spring of 2011 asking Ms. Westwood to “look at [the Director of\n\nLean Six Sigma position] and level it.” Id. at 538. The request contained no additional context,\n\nid., 15 and Ms. Westwood did not construe Ms. Harris’s inquiry as a challenge, id. at 539.\n\nApparently, Ms. Westwood thought that Ms. Harris was asking her to determine what the salary\n\ngrade would be for a position with the position description that mirrored the description for\n\nDirector of Lean Six Sigma. In considering Ms. Harris’s inquiry, Ms. Westwood discovered that\n\nthe job already existed and that the salary grade for the position was “M.” She relayed that\n\ninformation to Ms. Harris, evidently ending the inquiry. Id. (“[The request] came to me as\n\n[‘C]an you look at this and level it[?’] And so my translation was, oh, we have this job, and it’s\n\nthe job that Ms. Lapera is in and it’s an M.”).\n\n         Finally, in May or June of 2011, Ms. Harris submitted a request as part of the Promotion\n\nand Equity Process (“PEP”). Under PEP, a manager can submit, on behalf of his or her\n\nsubordinates, a request for a salary increase. Unlike the leveling process, the PEP process\n\naccounts for the employee’s performance and personal characteristics. Id. at 573. A member of\n\nthe Compensation Department, Sonia Matza, reviewed Ms. Lapera’s PEP request along with Ms.\n\n\n\n\n13\n          Notably, the individual who responded to the reclassification request, Mauricio Aguilar, is a member of\nMs. Lapera’s racial class, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 566, which “further undermines any inference of discrimination.” Glass\nv. Lahood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2144788\"><a href=\"/opinion/2144788/glass-v-lahood/\"><span class=\"volume\">786</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Tr. at 523, but to\navoid confusion, she is referred to as “Ms. Westwood.”\n15\n          Ms. Harris did attach a job description for the Director of Lean Six Sigma position to her email along with\na job description for a different position that had been assigned an “N” salary grade. Id. at 540-41. Ms. Westwood\ntestified that she did not recall seeing the second job description and that, in any event, she did not perceive Ms.\nHarris to be challenging the salary grade for the Director of Lean Six Sigma position. Id.\n\n                                                         20\n\fHarris, id. at 548, and ultimately increased Ms. Lapera’s salary by $28,000 to create a 17%\n\ndifferential between Ms. Lapera’s salary and her direct report’s salary, id. at 571.\n\n         In sum, then, Fannie Mae has amply proffered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for\n\nits salary leveling decisions at issue in this case. Thus, this Court need not analyze whether Ms.\n\nLapera has made out a prima facie case of discrimination on this ground. See Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1118252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. The only question is whether, based on all the evidence, a reasonable jury could\n\nfind that Fannie Mae’s stated reason is pretexual, and that the classification decision was\n\nmotivated by racial or personal-appearance animus. See Brady, 520 F.3d at 594; Primas v. Dist.\n\nof Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“Without overt evidence of discriminatory\n\nintent, [the plaintiff’s] case turns on her attempts to show ‘that the defendant’s explanation is\n\nunworthy of credence’ and that a jury could ‘reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation\n\nthat the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.’” (quoting Reeves, 530\n\nU.S. at 147)). As noted, in addressing her salary leveling claims, Ms. Lapera does not so much\n\nas mention pretext, let alone point to evidence in the record that creates as a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to whether the Compensation Department acted with a discriminatory motive in\n\nleveling Ms. Lapera’s salary or in later declining to adjust her salary grade. Accordingly, Fannie\n\nMae is entitled to summary judgment on Ms. Lapera’s salary leveling claims. 16\n\n                  3.       Non-Selection Claims\n\n         Ms. Lapera’s complaint asserts that Fannie Mae discriminated against her on the basis of\n\nher race and personal appearance when Fannie Mae passed over Ms. Lapera for the position of\n\nVice President of Planning and Alignment and instead hired Ms. Fraser. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 35. In\n\n\n16\n        Ms. Lapera’s salary leveling claims are obviously unmeritorious given her failure to address pretext.\nAccordingly, this Court need not address Fannie Mae’s alternative argument that the statute of limitations ran on\nMs. Lapera’s claim arising out of her 2009 request for reclassification of her position’s salary grade. See Def.’s\nMem. at 10; Def.’s Reply at 12.\n\n                                                         21\n\fparticular, Ms. Lapera argues that Ms. Gehring declined to promote Ms. Lapera because she was\n\nHispanic and overweight and that Ms. Gehring chose Ms. Fraser for the position because she was\n\nCaucasian and slender. 17 Pl.’s Opp’n at 24. “Where, as here, the employer claims a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory explanation for its decision to promote one employee over another, the ‘one\n\ncentral inquiry’ on summary judgment is ‘whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for\n\na reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the\n\nactual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a\n\nprohibited basis.’” Hamilton v.

In fact, however, the “direct evidence” that Ms. Lapera points to is indirect evidence of\ndiscrimination rather than direct evidence. The evidence that Ms. Lapera relies on suggests more broadly that Ms.\nGehring exhibited discriminatory attitudes toward Hispanic employees and overweight employees.

The Candidates’ Relative Qualifications\n\n       One way in which a plaintiff can establish pretext is by demonstrating that she was\n\nsignificantly more qualified than the selected applicant.

Here, the parties spill\n\nsignificant ink arguing over whether Ms. Lapera was significantly more qualified for the Vice\n\nPresident of Planning and Alignment position. The position description informs the Court’s\n\nanalysis of the candidates’ relative qualifications.\n\n       The first section of the position description, labeled “Overview of Job,” states that the\n\nVice President of Planning and Alignment is responsible for “facilitat[ing] consensus around a\n\nlong term, integrated execution plan for the restructuring of Fannie Mae and the housing\n\nindustry.” Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex.

The next section of the position description, titled “Key Job Functions and\n\nDuties,” sets out the responsibilities of the Vice President of Planning and Alignment, including:\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f(1) “acting as a trusted advisor” to the SVP of the EPMO and the CFO; (2) “[c]ommunicat[ing]\n\neffectively” about the Multi-Year Investment Plan, in writing and verbally, to the CFO, the\n\nManagement Committee, regulators, and the Fannie Mae Board of Directors by “taking very\n\ncomplex concepts and explaining them in a simple and concise manner;” (3) “manag[ing] the\n\nEPMO’s relationship with key external stakeholders, including FHFA;” (4) “support[ing] the\n\ngoals and objectives of the [] EPMO” and “[b]uild[ing] very strong relationships with the leaders\n\nof each pillar;” (5) “[p]rovid[ing] expert advice and interpretation of corporate governance\n\nactivities.” Id. at 1–2.\n\n        The third section of the job description details the requisite qualifications, including 10\n\nyears of experience (required); 5 years of managerial experience (preferred); expertise in\n\nprogram/project management or related areas; a bachelor’s degree (required); a master’s degree\n\n(preferred); the ability to communicate verbally and in writing with various levels of\n\nmanagement; demonstrated cross-function collaboration; an ability to anticipate and proactively\n\nsolve problems; an ability to influence people to get things done; an ability to apply techniques\n\nfor planning, monitoring, and control programs; and an ability to drive results in a swift and\n\nconstructive manner. Id. at 2. The final section of the job description sets out the broad\n\ncompetencies that applicants should have, essentially repeating, in vaguer terms, the requisite\n\nqualifications outlined in the previous section of the job description. Id.\n\n        Fannie Mae has effectively conceded that Ms. Lapera had “better knowledge and\n\nexperience than Ms. Fraser” as to the substantive areas within the position’s purview. Def.’s\n\nMem. at 21; see also Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 36 at 2, ECF No. 11-36 (interview notes of Mr. Choi,\n\nstating that Ms. Lapera possessed a “working knowledge of the EPMO, specifically the\n\n[Planning and Alignment] team; deep process expertise[;] [and] extensive Fannie Mae\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fexperience and work”). Indeed, Ms. Lapera had long been a member of the EPMO team, Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 31 at 1–2, whereas Ms. Fraser had most recently worked as Vice President for\n\nCorporate Financial Planning and Analysis, Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 30 at 2, ECF No. 11-30. Ms.\n\nLapera reported to the Vice President for Planning and Alignment (Ms. Keller) before she\n\napplied for that position, and at that time she was “performing the vast majority of the duties of\n\nthe VP position” and already managed 24 of the 30 employees on Ms. Keller’s team. Pl.’s\n\nStatement of Disputed Material Facts (“SDMF”) at 10, ECF 14-21. Ms. Lapera also had directed\n\nteams as large as 35 people, see Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 31 at 2, and had mentored and groomed other\n\nemployees, see id. In addition, Ms. Lapera had experience with “cross-function collaboration,”\n\nsee, e.g., id. at 1 (listing in her résumé that she had “[c]reat[ed] partnerships with business and\n\ncorporate support functions (Finance, HR, Business Architecture, and Risk) to deliver results”).\n\nFinally, Ms. Lapera possessed the requisite and preferred educational credentials. Id. at 2.\n\n       Set against this background, Ms. Lapera contends that she was significantly more\n\nqualified for the position of Vice President of Planning and Alignment than the selectee, Ms.\n\nFraser. As for Ms. Fraser’s qualifications, she was already serving as a vice president at Fannie\n\nMae when she was selected for the Vice President of Planning and Alignment position. Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 31 at 2. Like Ms. Lapera, Ms. Fraser had experience with cross-function collaboration\n\nand had groomed her team members for growth. Id. The undisputed evidence indicates that Ms.\n\nFraser had coordinated effectively and extensively with relevant stakeholders, including\n\nregulators, the Board of Directors, and the CEO and CFO. See id.; Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 638–39\n\n(noting Ms. Fraser’s strong relationships with the Fannie Mae CEO and CFO). The evidence\n\nsuggests that Ms. Fraser also possessed many of the “soft” skills listed in the position\n\ndescription. In particular, Ms. Gehring testified that Ms. Fraser possessed strong communication\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fskills and had successfully presented to the regulators and Fannie Mae executives on numerous\n\noccasions. See Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 638–39. Mr. Choi echoed that sentiment in his interview notes,\n\ncommenting that Ms. Fraser “has strong interpersonal and communication skills, which is\n\nimperative.” Def.’s MSJ, Ex. 36 at 2.\n\n       It is ultimately a close question whether a reasonable jury could find that Ms. Lapera was\n\nsignificantly more qualified for the position than Ms. Fraser. Among other things, Ms. Lapera\n\nappears to have had significantly more expertise in the relevant subject matter, more experience\n\nmanaging a large team, and more relevant education than Ms. Fraser. See Hamilton, 666 F.3d at\n\n1356 (“[D]rawing all reasonable inferences in [the plaintiff’s] favor, we believe that a reasonable\n\njury could find that, by comparison to [the selected applicant], [the plaintiff] had much greater\n\ntechnical expertise, more [relevant] experience . . . , and far more formal training.”).\n\nAccordingly, this Court proceeds to consider the other evidence that Ms. Lapera marshals to\n\ndemonstrate that Fannie Mae’s stated reason for selecting Ms. Fraser was pretextual. See id. at\n\n1352 (explaining that it was a “close question” whether the jury would find that the plaintiff was\n\nsignificantly or markedly more qualified than the selected applicant, and therefore proceeding to\n\n“‘review the record taken as a whole’” (quoting Reeves, 530 U.S. at 150)).\n\n                       b.      Whether Ms. Lapera Had Communication Issues\n\n       Ms. Lapera contends that “the evidence in the record and the testimony elicited at\n\narbitration provided no basis upon which a reasonable factfinders could conclude that Ms.\n\nGehring honestly believed Ms. Lapera lacked executive presence” or had communication issues.\n\nPl.’s Opp’n at 29. Fannie Mae disagrees, noting that both Ms. Gehring and another interviewer,\n\nShandell Harris, testified that Ms. Lapera would not be effective in communicating to Fannie\n\nMae executives. During arbitration, when asked why Ms. Lapera was not selected for the\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\fposition, Ms. Gehring stated that Ms. Lapera “has difficulties communicating at an executive\n\nlevel. Her written communications are inappropriate and her verbal communications are\n\nsomewhat crass and unpredictable.” Def.’s Arb. Tr. at 613. When pressed for more information,\n\nMs. Gehring explained that Ms. Lapera’s “written communications were somewhat juvenile and\n\ncartoonish and her verbal communications were very unpredictable and she had a negative way\n\nof talking about the organization and its objectives.” Id. at 614–15. Ms. Gehring provided\n\nexamples, noting that Ms. Lapera had second-guessed Fannie Mae’s President’s judgment in a\n\nmeeting with more junior staff and that she “interrupted every single staff meeting” with a\n\n“negative comment.” Id. at 617. Ms. Gehring described Ms. Lapera’s written work product as\n\n“somewhat preachy, juvenile and cartoonish.” Id. at 619 (explaining that Ms. Lapera used clip\n\nart, “and that’s just not appropriate at the executive level”).\n\n       Ms. Harris expressed similar concerns with Ms. Lapera’s communication skills. In her\n\nnotes from Ms. Lapera’s interview, Ms. Harris reported that Ms. Lapera’s “real area of focus\n\nwould be her executive presence and communicating with the OC and MC. I think this area of\n\ndevelopment . . . is critical given this role, so I would not see her as the best candidate.” Def.’s\n\nMSJ, Ex. 37 at 1, ECF. No. 11-37. During arbitration, Ms. Harris stated that she told Ms. Lapera\n\nthat her only reservation in selecting Ms. Lapera was her executive presence. Def.’s Arb. Tr. at\n\n478. When asked what she meant by that, Ms. Harris confirmed: “It was a communication style.\n\nSometimes I observed that [Ms. Lapera] could ramble, kind of not be on point. I think it’s\n\nimportant in communicating with executives that you are crisp and to the point and provide\n\ndetail as requested.” Id. Ms. Harris stated that she developed concerns about Ms. Lapera’s\n\ncommunication skills by observing her in staff meetings, where “she tended to be sometimes\n\nemotional in the delivery of her message.” Id. at 479. In sum, then, evidence from two persons\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\finvolved in the selection process indicates that they did not view Ms. Lapera as an effective\n\ncommunicator for senior executives at the company.\n\n       Ms. Lapera, however, disputes Fannie Mae’s evidence with evidence of her own,\n\ncontending that Fannie Mae’s stated rationale that Ms. Lapera had poor communication skills, is\n\nfalse. See Lathram, 336 F.3d at 1089–90 (“In ‘appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can\n\nreasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up\n\na discriminatory purpose.’” (quoting Reeves, 530 U.S. at 147)). First, Ms. Lapera cites her own\n\ntestimony that when she worked for the then-President of Fannie Mae, Mike Williams, around\n\n2008, he “never expressed any concerns with [her] communications.” Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 49. Such\n\nself-serving testimony regarding her own assessment of her superior’s view of her\n\ncommunication skills, standing alone, without corroboration, is not sufficient to raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether Fannie Mae decisionmakers actually believed that Ms.\n\nLapera had communication problems. See Burley, 801 F.3d at 298 (“[While] a plaintiff’s own\n\nfirsthand observations of relevant facts are probative evidence[] that [] must not [be] set [] aside\n\nmerely because they come from a party who necessarily has a stake in the outcome,” where\n\ncontrary evidence is present, “the plausibility of those differing observations and inferences is\n\nnot, without more,” sufficient “grounds on which a factfinder reasonably could conclude that”\n\nthe employer’s stated reason “was a pretext for racial discrimination.”); Steele v. Carter, ___ F.\n\nSupp. 3d ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3620722</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16 (D.D.C. June 29, 2016) (“Plaintiff’s own self-\n\nperception of why he was hired—standing alone without corroboration—does not offer any\n\ncredible evidence of discriminatory intent.”); Lawrence v.

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 169\n\n(D.D.C. 2015) (“Plaintiff’s self-serving statement that she had the qualifications for GS-11 pay\n\n. . . cannot alone support a genuine dispute as to that fact.”). There is more, however.\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\f       First, Ms. Lapera’s coworker, Mr. Tomasello, flatly contradicted Ms. Gehring’s\n\ntestimony that Ms. Lapera was disruptive during staff meetings. Mr. Tomasello testified during\n\narbitration that Ms. Lapera’s comments during meetings were “absolutely” appropriate for the\n\naudience and responded “yes” when asked if Ms. Lapera’s comments were clear. Pl.’s Arb. Tr.\n\nat 711–12. Next, Ms. Lapera notes that her 2012 year-end performance review says nothing\n\nabout communication difficulties. See generally Pl.’s Opp’n, Ex. T, ECF No. 11-20. Instead,\n\nthe general tenor of the review is high praise for Ms. Lapera’s work and leadership. See\n\ngenerally id. Although Ms. Gehring testified that she typically does not read performance\n\nreviews and does not recall reading Ms. Lapera’s 2012 review, Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 614, the fact\n\nremains that Ms. Lapera’s supervisor did not raise any issues with Ms. Lapera’s communication\n\nskills. Cf. Hamilton, 666 F.3d at 1355 (noting that the absence of contemporaneous evidence in\n\nsupport of the proffered explanation is potentially probative of pretext). In sum, then, it remains\n\nan open question whether Fannie Mae decisionmakers genuinely believed that Ms. Lapera had\n\npoor communication skills. The issue ultimately hinges on a credibility determination—whether\n\nto believe Ms. Gehring and Ms. Harris in light of the competing evidence. This question is\n\nsquarely within the province of a jury.\n\n                       c.     Irregularities in the Hiring Process\n\n       Under certain circumstances, procedural irregularities can support a finding of pretext.\n\nSee Evans v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 620 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“Employees may cast doubt on the\n\nemployer’s proffered reason by, among other things, pointing to . . . ‘the employer’s failure to\n\nfollow established procedures or criteria . . . .”); Lathram, 336 F.3d at 1093–94 (holding that the\n\nemployer’s decision to open the position to applicants outside the employer’s workforce when it\n\ndid not always do so was evidence of pretext). Here, Ms. Lapera notes that “Ms. Gehring\n\n\n\n                                                29\n\fpermitted Ms. Fraser to apply for the vice president position one month after the posting closed,\n\nscheduled her for an interview before she had applied for the position or sent in her resume, and\n\nscheduled her for an hour long interview with Ms. Gehring over lunch, while the other\n\ncandidates were scheduled for half hour interviews in Ms. Gehring’s office.” Pl.’s Opp’n at 30–\n\n31. The evidence on these points is murky.\n\n       Regarding Fannie Mae’s decision to accept Ms. Fraser’s application after the closing date\n\nfor the job posting, Ms. Westwood, the Director of Compensation, was asked during her\n\narbitration testimony whether her office “would typically investigate[] an interview for a vacant\n\nposition where you have a closing date and people are added after that closing date.” Pl.’s Arb.\n\nTr. at 692. Ms. Westwood answered, “No, absolutely not. That happens all the time.” Id.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Werner, who headed the recruitment process for the position, testified that she\n\nmight accept a late application “for any number of reasons, somebody was on vacation, they\n\nmissed a deadline.” Id. at 436 (explaining that Fannie Mae’s practice is to accept applications\n\nvia an online portal but that the formal policy is not so stringent). Ms. Lapera did not introduce\n\nany evidence to call this testimony into question. Thus, it appears that accepting a belated\n\napplication from Ms. Fraser was not actually irregular.\n\n       Another irregularity cited by Ms. Lapera was scheduling Ms. Fraser for an interview\n\nbefore receiving her application, but evidence regarding whether this chronology was unusual is\n\nminimal. See Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 440 (discussing who decided to interview Ms. Fraser before she\n\nsubmitted her application but not stating whether that was atypical). Fannie Mae posits that the\n\nevidence is inconclusive as to whether it was inappropriate for Ms. Gehring to conduct Ms.\n\nFraser’s interview over lunch and for a longer period of time than the other interviews, which\n\nwere conducted in Ms. Gehring’s office. Def.’s Reply Mem. at 19. Ms. Werner initially testified\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fthat she was not sure whether an interviewer would typically take only one candidate to lunch\n\nbut thought that such activity might vary based on schedule and availability. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at\n\n444. Shortly thereafter though, Ms. Werner was asked, “Would [it] be improper for a lunch\n\ninterview for just one applicant and not the other applicants?” Id. at 445. Ms. Werner responded\n\n“[y]es” and also stated that when she had conducted a lunch interview in the past, she did so for\n\nall applicants. Id. She further stated that interviews should be the same length of time, while\n\nalso testifying that “there could be many factors that influence why interviews go long.” Id. at\n\n445–46.\n\n       Consideration of all this evidence indicates that at least some of the cited “irregularities”\n\nare, in fact, not uncommon at Fannie Mae and therefore not probative of pretext. Nevertheless, a\n\nreasonable jury could conclude, based on Ms. Werner’s shifting responses to the questions about\n\nlunch interviews and interview durations, that something was amiss, which adds at least\n\nmarginally to the evidence supporting a finding of pretext.\n\n                      d.      Ms. Gehring’s Biases\n\n       Finally, Ms. Lapera points to evidence suggesting that Ms. Gehring was biased against\n\nHispanic and overweight employees. Pl.’s Opp’n at 10–15, 24–25. Such evidence, if believed\n\nby a jury, can be probative of pretext. Evans, 716 F.3d at 620 (explaining that pretext can be\n\nshown by, among other things, “‘[an] employer’s general treatment of minority employees; or\n\ndiscriminatory statements by the decisionmaker’” (quoting Brady, 520 F.3d at 495)).\n\n       According to Ms. Lapera’s testimony, Ms. Gehring targeted overweight employees and\n\nHispanic employees from the beginning of her tenure as Senior Vice President. In September of\n\n2012, when Ms. Gehring first became Senior Vice President, she called a town hall meeting.\n\nPl.’s Arb. Tr. at 110–11. After the meeting, Ms. Gehring called Ms. Lapera and said that the\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fbusiness architecture team managed by Ms. Lapera is “going to have a long way to go to be able\n\nto represent EPMO the way I want it represented.” Id. at 111. According to Ms. Lapera, Ms.\n\nGehring specifically mentioned Blythe Neumiller, Patricia Brumbaugh, and Dina Purcell, all\n\nthree of whom to varying degrees are overweight. Id. at 112–13. Ms. Neumiller was the largest\n\nmember of the team and was so overweight that she had trouble walking, id. at 112, and, during a\n\nstaff meeting, Ms. Gehring commented to a group of employees that Ms. Neumiller “waddles”\n\nwhile she walks, id. When Ms. Neumiller later left the team, evidently due to concern about her\n\ncareer prospects under Ms. Gehring’s leadership, Ms. Gehring allegedly “congratulated [Ms.\n\nLapera] on getting [Ms. Neumiller] to move voluntarily to the other team,” notwithstanding the\n\nlack of issues with Ms. Neumiller’s performance. Id. at 115–16.\n\n       Also after the town hall meeting, Ms. Gehring allegedly told Ms. Lapera that she “could\n\nsee [Ms. Brumbaugh’s] tummy from where [she] was sitting” and then instructed Ms. Lapera\n\nthat her team needed to start “dressing up better.” Id. at 113. In December of 2012, Ms. Lapera\n\nconducted her semi-annual performance ratings of her staff and recommended that Ms.\n\nBrumbaugh receive a rating of a “2” 18 to reflect “the amazing deliverables that she produced that\n\nparticular year.” Id. at 132–33. Although Ms. Gehring agreed that Ms. Brumbaugh’s work was\n\nstrong, she stated that Ms. Brumbaugh lacked “executive presence” and did not have the “look”\n\nthat team members should have. Id. at 133–34. Accordingly, Ms. Gehring downgraded Ms.\n\nBrumbaugh’s rating to a “3.” Id. 135.\n\n       Ms. Lapera also cites Ms. Gehring’s treatment of Ms. Keller. Ms. Lapera testified that, in\n\nApril 2013 at a staff meeting, Ms. Gehring told Ms. Keller that she too used to be overweight\n\nand could help Ms. Keller achieve her weight loss goals. Id. at 138. Ms. Gehring then turned to\n\n\n\n18\n       A rating of “2” equated to “exceeds expectations.” Id. at 132.\n\n                                                       32\n\fMs. Lapera and told Ms. Lapera that she “could look better too.” Id. Ms. Keller left her position\n\nshortly after the April 2013 staff meeting. Id. at 140. Finally, Ms. Lapera points out that Ms.\n\nGehring arranged for an image consultant to come to Fannie Mae to speak with her subordinates\n\nabout image improvement. Pl.’s Arb. Tr. at 118–29. Ms. Lapera and Mr. Tomasello testified\n\nthat Ms. Gehring pressured the EPMO staff to attend the class, where the consultant told the\n\nwomen that they should wear make-up and avoid wearing colors that clash with their skin and\n\ncolor their gray hair. Id. at 122–24; id. at 714 (“Q. And what was the emphasis on at that image\n\nconsulting session? A. Aesthetics. Mostly, you know, not delivering results, but, you know,\n\nwear a coat, wear a suit and tie if you’re a man, make sure you have well-pressed clothes, your\n\nhair combed, wear the proper level of make-up.”).\n\n       Ms. Lapera’s evidence of Ms. Gehring’s bias against Hispanic employees is less robust,\n\nbut it is there. Ms. Lapera relies on her own testimony that Ms. Gehring commented that a\n\nHispanic employee, Shirley Cruz Rodriguez, would “need to work on [her] accent because there\n\nis no way she’s going to progress with an accent like the one she has.” Id. at 137. Ms. Lapera\n\ntestified that Ms. Rodriguez’s accent did not affect her performance evaluation but that Ms.\n\nGehring made clear that “unless [Ms. Rodriguez’s] accent changed, she [would] not have any []\n\nopportunities for promotion.” Id.\n\n       To be sure, the testimony about Ms. Gehring’s statements about Hispanic and overweight\n\nemployees is disputed. Ms. Gehring denies having made the comments, see Def.’s Reply Mem.\n\nat 18 & n.3, and even if she did, some are susceptible of innocent interpretations, such as Ms.\n\nGehring’s offer to help Ms. Keller lose weight. If believed, however, this testimony permits the\n\ninference that Ms. Gehring held negative views of Hispanic and overweight employees, and a\n\n\n\n\n                                                33\n\fjury could infer that Ms. Gehring acted upon those views in declining to select Ms. Lapera for\n\nthe Vice President of Planning and Alignment position.\n\n                                                     ***\n\n       Although a close call, reviewing the record as a whole, Ms. Lapera has produced\n\nsufficient evidence to create a genuine issue as to whether Fannie Mae’s rationale for selecting\n\nMs. Fraser for the Vice President of Planning and Alignment position was pretextual. “In the\n\nend, the record supports two plausible interpretations of what happened.” Evans, 716 F.3d at\n\n622. One view is that Ms. Gehring, who drove the hiring process, harbored biases toward\n\nHispanic and overweight employees and selected Ms. Fraser not because she was more qualified\n\nbut because she fit the mold in terms of demographics and personal appearance that Ms. Gerhing\n\npreferred. The other view is that, notwithstanding her subject matter expertise, Ms. Lapera\n\nsimply lacked the requisite communication skills to be effective in the Vice President of\n\nPlanning and Alignment role. Ultimately, a jury will get to choose between these “competing\n\nviews.” Id.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, Fannie Mae’s motion for summary judgment is granted in part\n\nand denied in part. Specifically, this motion is granted as to all of Ms. Lapera’s age\n\ndiscrimination claims as well as her salary leveling claims. The motion is denied as to Ms.\n\nLapera’s non-selection claims alleging racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and racial\n\nand personal-appearance discrimination under the DCHRA. The parties are directed to jointly\n\nsubmit, by October 19, 2016, three proposed dates for trial on the claims remaining in this\n\ncase.
