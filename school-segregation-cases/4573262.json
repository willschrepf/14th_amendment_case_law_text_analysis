HOUGH,\n     Respondent-Appellee/Cross-Appellant.\n________________________________________________________________\n\n\n      Appeal from the Iowa District Court for Linn County, Fae E. Hoover\n\nGrinde, Judge.\n\n\n\n      Both parties appeal the economic provisions of the decree dissolving their\n\nmarriage. AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n      Kyle A. Sounheim of Lynch Dallas, P.C., Cedar Rapids, for appellant.\n\n      Jacob R. Koller of Simmons Perrine Moyer Bergman P.L.C., Cedar\n\nRapids, for appellee.\n\n\n\n      Considered by Potterfield, P.J., and Doyle and Tabor, JJ.\n\f                                              2\n\n\nTABOR, Judge.\n\n         Brian Smith appeals and Bonnie Hough1 cross-appeals the economic\n\nprovisions of the decree dissolving their marriage. We affirm the district court’s\n\norder that Brian compensate Bonnie for an equal share of the increase in the\n\nvalue of the marital home. But we modify the decree in several ways, including\n\nchanges to the division of Brian’s retirement assets and a recalculation of the\n\nequalization payment. We remand for the district court to modify the decree in\n\naccordance with this decision.\n\n         I.      Facts and Prior Proceedings\n\n         Brian and Bonnie met in the summer of 1998. At that time, Bonnie and\n\nher two sons were living in Tennessee. They moved to Iowa the next summer to\n\nlive with Brian. Bonnie and Brian were married on September 28, 2002; they had\n\nno children together. Bonnie’s children graduated from high school and left the\n\nmarital home by 2008.\n\n         Brian is fifty-eight years old. He has a community-college degree and\n\nworks as a senior mechanical engineer at Rockwell Collins. He has been a full-\n\ntime employee there for thirty-six years, earning more than $105,000 per year.\n\n         Bonnie is fifty-one years old. In 1986, she graduated with a bachelor’s\n\ndegree in secondary education—physical education and health. In 2002, Bonnie\n\nstarted online classes toward her masters of health administration degree, but\n\nshe had not completed the program by the time of trial.                When Bonnie left\n\nTennessee in 1999, she was earning $65,000 per year; she found a job in Iowa\n\npaying $20,000 less per year. It took her about ten years in Iowa to obtain a\n\n1\n    The district court granted Bonnie’s request to return to using her maiden name.\n\f                                        3\n\n\nsalary level somewhat equivalent to her Tennessee income, despite the fact she\n\nconsistently maintained full-time employment. She now earns $90,200 per year\n\nas a senior administrator overseeing seventy staff members in two Unity Point\n\nClinics.\n\n       In January 1989, Brian paid $55,498 to purchase the home that became\n\nthe marital residence. Thus, Brian owned the home for a decade before Bonnie\n\nmoved to Iowa. The home was assessed at $119,585 when the parties married,\n\nand in June 2003 the mortgage principal was $39,539. In 2004, Brian and a\n\nfriend completed a major addition on the home, with Brian utilizing his\n\nexceptional woodworking skills.    Brian testified the addition was intended to\n\naccommodate the whole family—the boys had separate bedrooms, he and\n\nBonnie had a larger master bedroom, and a bigger living room allowed them “to\n\nspread out.” Brian also updated existing areas, and the parties purchased new\n\nappliances. Bonnie had input on the project’s design and planning. She also\n\ncleaned up construction debris and landscaped the property. At the time of trial,\n\nthe home’s assessed value had increased from its 2003 value by $54,915—to\n\n$174,500, and the joint mortgage’s principal balance had been reduced to\n\n$31,057, i.e., an $8482 pay down of mortgage debt during the marriage.\n\n       During the parties’ marriage, they agreed to keep separate accounts for\n\ntheir banking and credit cards. Bonnie covered her children’s health insurance\n\nfor two years during the marriage; thereafter, Brian covered them under his\n\nRockwell Collins health insurance.2 The parties agreed Bonnie would pay all the\n\n\n2\n Bonnie explained her ex-husband’s employment was sporadic; thus, he was unable to\nprovide consistent health insurance for their sons.\n\f                                            4\n\n\nchildren’s expenses—school, clothing, and medical.             Sometimes she worked\n\npart-time jobs, in addition to her full-time job, to meet her expenses.3 Brian\n\nbought birthday and Christmas presents for the children; “gave them money\n\nevery so often”; and when their high school graduations approached, Brian\n\nvoluntarily started a 529 college savings plan for them.4 See 26 U.S.C. § 529\n\n(allowing states to establish qualified tuition programs where person may\n\ncontribute for designated beneficiaries). At trial, Bonnie admitted Brian had no\n\nlegal obligation to support her sons.\n\n       The parties also agreed to a specific plan to divide their living expenses.\n\nAs of 2003, any loans secured by the real estate were joint loans. But Brian\n\nwould pay for the mortgage, tax, and insurance on the house, while Bonnie paid\n\nfor the utilities (electric, water, sewer), the home telephone—until it was\n\ndiscontinued—everyone’s cell phones, cable television, and groceries. Bonnie\n\npaid for landscaping materials and provided the majority of the landscaping labor.\n\nInitially, Bonnie and Brian each paid for their own car insurance. But when they\n\nmarried in 2002, Brian added Bonnie to his car insurance. Bonnie also provided\n\nnon-economic contributions to the family such as cooking and cleaning. After\n\nBrian hurt his shoulder, Bonnie also shoveled the snow.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Bonnie explained Brian had a better cash flow than she did during the marriage: “[Brian\nhad fewer] bills coming out monthly. Again, he was making double my salary at several\nportions of the marriage. And I had more expenses going out of my pocket for my\nchildren.”\n4\n  At the time of trial, Bonnie’s two sons were ages twenty-six and twenty-eight, and the\ntotal balance in Brian’s 529 accounts had been reduced to around $1500. Brian has a\nclose relationship with the son living in the Cedar Rapids area, who has graduated from\ncollege. Brian considers that son’s child to be Brian’s grandchild. Brian plans to roll his\ncurrent 529 balances into a new 529 plan for the benefit of this grandchild.\n\f                                        5\n\n\n      Brian filed a dissolution petition on December 11, 2013, and trial\n\ncommenced on August 20, 2015. The parties presented financial information to\n\nthe court, including the value of various retirement accounts and the marital\n\nhome. Brian proposed Bonnie “should receive zero of the equity in the marital\n\nresidence” because he had made all the mortgage payments and because the\n\nparties “have always had separate accounts.” He also asked to be awarded his\n\nhealth savings account, his defined-benefit plan, and his 401(k)—valued at over\n\n$1 million.   Brian agreed Bonnie should retain her $73,000 in retirement\n\naccounts, and he urged the court to hold each party responsible for their own\n\ndebts—Brian ($32,238) and Bonnie ($79,426).\n\n      In contrast, Bonnie asked the court to award her a marital portion of both\n\nBrian’s 401(k) and his defined-benefit plan by the entry of qualified domestic\n\nrelations orders (QDROs). She requested a portion of the marital home’s equity\n\nand appreciation, pointing out the mortgage was joint debt. Bonnie sought a\n\nproperty-equalization payment and trial attorney fees.\n\n      The district court entered its decree dissolving the marriage and dividing\n\nthe parties’ assets on February 14, 2016. The court ordered each party to pay\n\nhis or her attorney fees and required Bonnie to pay the remaining court costs.\n\nBoth parties filed post-trial motions, which the court summarily denied. Brian\n\nnow appeals, and Bonnie cross-appeals.\n\n      II.     Scope and Standards of Review\n\n      We review the decree de novo. See In re Marriage of McDermott, 827\n\nN.W.2d 671, 676 (Iowa 2013). After examining the entire record, we adjudicate\n\nanew the property-distribution issues. See id. We give weight to the district\n\f                                          6\n\n\ncourt’s findings of fact, particularly with regard to witness credibility, though such\n\nfindings are not binding. See id.\n\n       III.     Division of Property\n\n       When a couple divorces, Iowa law requires an equitable division of marital\n\nproperty. Iowa Code § 598.21(5) (2013); see also In re Marriage of Hansen, 733\n\nN.W.2d 683, 702 (Iowa 2007). First, we determine what property held by the\n\nparties is subject to division. See In re Marriage of Fennelly, 737 N.W.2d 97, 102\n\n(Iowa 2007). Second, considering the factors in Iowa Code section 598.21(5),\n\nwe decide how to equitably divide that property. See id. The property division\n\ndoes not need to be equal or follow a certain percentage; rather, this court makes\n\nan equitable award under the circumstances. See In re Marriage of Hoak, 364\n\nN.W.2d 185, 194 (Iowa 1985). “[W]e will disturb a district court determination\n\nonly when there has been a failure to do equity.” In re Marriage of Mauer, 874\n\nN.W.2d 103, 106 (Iowa 2016); see also In re Marriage of Vieth, 591 N.W.2d 639,\n\n641 (Iowa Ct. App. 1999) (“[W]e give strong deference to the trial court which,\n\nafter sorting through the economic details of the parties, made a fair division\n\nsupported by the record.”).\n\n       We, like the district court, consider the parties’ property in three broad\n\ncategories—retirement assets, home appreciation, and equalization payment.\n\n       A.       Retirement Assets\n\n       The district court awarded Bonnie her three retirement accounts totaling\n\n$73,211.      The parties do not challenge that award.      It is the district court’s\n\ncalculation and distribution of Brian’s more substantial retirement assets that the\n\nparties debate on appeal.\n\f                                         7\n\n\n      Generally, a property division involving retirement benefits evolves in two\n\nsteps. In re Marriage of Heath-Clark, No. 15-0525, 2016 WL 2753779, at *3\n\n(Iowa Ct. App. May 11, 2016). First, the district court enters a dissolution decree,\n\nwhich is a substantive order equitably dividing and assigning the parties’\n\nproperty. Id. (citing In re Marriage of Brown, 776 N.W.2d 644, 647-48 (Iowa\n\n2009) (discussing finality of decrees, property division, and qualified domestic\n\nrelations orders (QDROs)).       Second, to implement the court’s division of\n\nretirement benefits, a QDRO is entered that directs the plan administrator to\n\nmake specified payments to the non-employee ex-spouse. Id. Thus, “a QDRO\n\nis characterized properly as a procedural device required by federal law and\n\nentered to effectuate the property division made in the dissolution decree.” Id.\n\n      Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings Plan—401(k). Brian’s 401(k) was\n\nworth $138,983 when the parties married in September 2002. The district court\n\nfound, as of the August 2015 trial date, the value of this account was $1,061,238.\n\nThe court set aside Brian’s premarital value of $138,983 and ordered the asset\n\n“divided by way of a QDRO. Bonnie shall be awarded $387,916.50.” On appeal,\n\nBonnie claims the court should not have set aside the premarital value to Brian,\n\nasserting her numerous contributions to the marriage require that amount to be\n\nincluded. Bonnie also points out she “worked over a ten-year period to return to\n\nher previous earning capacity,” which she claims limited her ability to save for\n\nretirement.   But Brian testified Bonnie’s limited savings is a result of her\n\ninappropriate spending on vehicles and other items during the marriage.\n\n      Premarital property is not automatically excluded from the marital estate\n\nlike gifted or inherited property.   See Iowa Code § 598.21(5)(b).         Instead,\n\f                                         8\n\n\npremarital property is subject to division, and its “premarital” status is just one\n\nfactor to be considered along with other circumstances. McDermott, 827 N.W.2d\n\nat 678; see also In re Marriage of Miller, 552 N.W.2d 460, 465 (Iowa Ct. App.\n\n1996) (explaining fact property is premarital “may” justify a set off). After our de\n\nnovo review, we agree with the district court’s finding that under the\n\ncircumstances of this marriage, where both parties were gainfully employed\n\nbefore they married and each retained some financial independence during the\n\nmarriage, equity requires the premarital value to be set aside to Brian. Thus, the\n\nmarital value of Brian’s 401(k) is $922,255, as specifically found by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n         Next, Brian and Bonnie both request an adjustment to the $922,255\n\nmarital value. Brian asks us to reduce the value before calculating a distribution\n\namount to Bonnie, claiming a fixed dollar amount is inequitable where the gross\n\nvalue allegedly decreased after the trial and before entry of the decree. We are\n\nnot persuaded. First, no evidence in the record supports his argument. Second,\n\nthe trial date is a reasonable time to set the value. See In re Marriage of Nelson,\n\nNo. 15-0492, 2016 WL 3269573, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Jun. 15, 2016) (“Assets\n\nshould be given their value as of the date of trial.”); In re Marriage of Ranard, No.\n\n09-0607, 2010 WL 625013, at *4 (Iowa Ct. App. Feb. 24, 2010) (declining\n\nrequest to decrease retirement asset’s value where value declined between trial\n\nand decree).\n\n         In a separate cross-appeal argument, Bonnie asserts the portion of 401(k)\n\nfunds awarded to her “should be subject to gains and losses between the date of\n\nthe decree and the distribution of funds into her name,” citing as support several\n\f                                            9\n\ncases from other jurisdictions and In re Marriage of Madsen, No. 09-1061, 2010\n\nWL 786201, at *3 (Iowa Ct. App. Mar. 10, 2010) (granting order nunc pro tunc\n\nwhere decree was silent as to valuation date).             Because we find Madsen\n\ndistinguishable from the circumstances here5 and because Bonnie does not cite\n\nany Iowa Supreme Court case so holding, we decline her requested\n\nmodification.6 See, e.g., In re Marriage of Muehlhaupt, 439 N.W.2d 656, 661\n\n(Iowa 1989) (“It is the net worth of the parties at the time of trial which is relevant\n\nin adjusting their property rights.”); Spencer v. Philipp, No. 13-1887, 2014 WL\n\n4230223, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 27, 2014) (“As a general rule, the task of\n\nmaterially altering substantive or procedural rights is best left to the General\n\nAssembly or the Supreme Court of Iowa.”).\n\n       As a final matter, we conclude equity requires each party in this thirteen-\n\nyear marriage to leave with an equal share of marital retirement assets. See In\n\nre Marriage of White, 537 N.W.2d 744, 746 (Iowa 1995) (stating appreciation in\n\nthe value of assets during the marriage is a marital asset). Accordingly, we\n\nmodify the court’s calculation, as requested by Bonnie, to provide that her marital\n\nshare of Brian’s 401(k) is $424,522, which results in both parties receiving\n\n$497,733 in marital retirement assets.7 On remand, a QDRO consistent with this\n\nmodification shall be entered.\n\n\n5\n  The Madsen court explained its ruling did not involve “a request to change the\n‘valuation date’ set forth in the dissolution decree . . . . The decree was silent as to\nvaluation date, it simply provided for equal division.” See 2010 WL 786201, at *3.\nUnlike the district court in Madsen, the district court in this case specified a valuation\ndate, stating: “The value of the 401(k) nearest the time of trial is $1,061,238.”\n6\n  Neither party asked for this case to be retained by our supreme court. Our court\napplies “existing legal principles.” See Iowa R. App. P. 6.1101(3).\n7\n  Brian’s 401(k) has a marital value of $922,255, and Bonnie will keep her $73,211 in\nmarital retirement assets, which makes the difference in the parties’ marital retirement\n\f                                           10\n\n\n       Defined-Benefit Pension. In Iowa, pension benefits are marital property\n\nsubject to an equitable distribution. In re Marriage of Branstetter, 508 N.W.2d\n\n638, 641-42 (Iowa 1993). Our courts have recognized two methods of dividing\n\npension benefits: the present value payable immediately or a percentage payable\n\nwhen the benefits become matured. See In re Marriage of Benson, 545 N.W.2d\n\n252, 255 (Iowa 1996). Further, “there are two main types of pension plans:\n\ndefined-benefit plans and defined-contribution plans.” In re Marriage of Sullins,\n\n715 N.W.2d 242, 248 (Iowa 2006). Brian’s pension is a defined-benefit plan.8\n\nGenerally, it is “desirable to divide a defined-benefit plan by using the percentage\n\nmethod,” which is the method the district court used here. See id. Under the\n\npercentage method, an award is effectuated by a QDRO, “which is paid if and\n\nwhen the benefits mature.” Id. at 250; see also Faber v. Herman, 731 N.W.2d 1,\n\n7 (Iowa 2007) (stating non-member spouse receives “a share of the pension\n\nbenefits at some point in the future when they become payable to the\n\npensioner”).\n\n       The district court ordered Brian’s pension to be “divided using the Benson\n                                             [ ]\nformula, (Bonnie shall receive one-half 9 of the fractional portion of the plan\n\ncalculated by using [thirteen] years as the numerator, and the years of\n\nassets $849,044. One-half of this difference is $424,522. When we deduct $424,522\nfrom $922,255, Brian’s remaining marital 401(k) is $497,733. When we add $424,522 to\nBonnie’s existing $73,211 in marital retirement assets, her marital retirement assets now\nlikewise total $497,733. We note Brian’s total 401(k) assets are $636,716 after the\npremarital set off is included.\n8\n   Depending on the formula used by Rockwell Collins for its pension plan, the future\nbenefit payable to Brian may contain two variables: (1) years of service and (2) earnings.\nSee Benson, 545 N.W.2d at 255.\n9\n   “Absent agreement to the contrary, and there is none, [Bonnie] should receive half of\nthe marital share” of Brian’s defined-benefit plan. See In re Marriage of Kasik, No. 15-\n1713, 2016 WL 4543981, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2016). As found by the district\ncourt, Bonnie’s share is 50%.\n\f                                          11\n\n\ncontribution as the denominator).” Thus, although the decree made no provision\n\nfor the entry of a QDRO as to this asset, the district court used the “service factor\n\npercentage method,” which “divides the pension according to a percentage\n\nmultiplied by a factor based on the member’s service during the marriage and the\n\nmember’s total service.” See Faber, 731 N.W.2d at 8.\n\n       On appeal, Brian argues for revision of both the numerator and the\n\ndenominator. Before addressing his specific arguments, we turn to the analysis\n\nin Benson. In that case, our supreme court discussed the valuation and division\n\nof a defined-benefit plan in the context of a marital property settlement. 545\n\nN.W.2d at 255-57. Benson instructed: “[T]he numerator [is] the number of years\n\nduring the marriage [the employee] accrued benefits under the pension plan . . .\n\nand the denominator [is] the total number of year’s [the employee’s] benefits\n\naccrued prior to maturity (i.e., receipt of payments upon retirement.)” See id. at\n\n255 (stating this fraction recognizes the percentage of the employee’s pension\n\n“attributable to the parties’ joint marital efforts”). In other words, this fraction is\n\n“based on the member’s service during the marriage and the member’s total\n\nservice.” Faber, 731 N.W.2d at 8.\n\n       Brian asks us to reduce the numerator from thirteen years to 3.75 years—\n\nthe time he was both married and contributing to the plan. We are not persuaded\n\nto do so. Brian and Bonnie were married at the end of September 2002, and as\n\nof December 31, 2002, Brian had credited service in his pension of 23.58 years.\n\nRockwell Collins discontinued employee contributions on September 30, 2006.\n\nBrian’s credited service from December 31, 2002, to September 30, 2006, was\n\n3.75 years.   Thus, at the date Brian’s contributions ended, his total credited\n\f                                        12\n\n\nservice was 27.33 years. Nevertheless, Brian was “covered” by the plan during\n\nhis entire marriage, as shown by the fact Brian’s credited service when he\n\nreaches age sixty-two will be 39.9167 years.         See Heath-Clark, 2016 WL\n\n2753779, at *5 (stating Benson formula is correctly set forth by using a numerator\n\nof “the number of quarters covered during the marriage period,” i.e., the date of\n\nmarriage through the date of the dissolution decree). We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s numerator—thirteen years.\n\n      As to the denominator, Brian faults the court’s description, claiming the\n\ndenominator includes the period of time after he stopped contributing to the plan\n\nand until the plan matures in the future. We agree the district court did not fully\n\ndefine the denominator portion of the fraction, and therefore, we modify the\n\ndecree to conform to the Benson formula. See id. at *9 (Danilson, J., dissenting)\n\n(stating confusion as to the correct denominator under Benson “is compounded\n\nby other [supreme court cases] using different terminology to describe the\n\ndenominator”).\n\n      Under Benson, the denominator is the number of years Brian was\n\n“covered” by the plan “prior to conclusion (maturity)).” See 545 N.W.2d at 255;\n\nsee also Faber, 731 N.W.2d at 8 (stating Benson denominator is “the member’s\n\ntotal service”); Heath-Clark, 2016 WL 2753779, at *8 (majority opinion)\n\n(upholding, under Benson, a provision stating “the denominator is the Member’s\n\ntotal quarters of service covered by [the employer’s pension plan] and used in\n\ncalculating the Member’s benefit”). Further, “the value of the pension benefit\n\nshould be determined at the time of [the covered employee’s] retirement.” In re\n\nMarriage of Colarusso, 2015 WL 8464727, at *8 (Iowa Ct. App. Dec. 9, 2015).\n\f                                           13\n\n\nAccordingly, we modify the decree and remand for the entry of a QDRO10 to\n\ndivide Brian’s monthly pension benefits, if and when received, 11 under the\n\nfollowing formula:\n\n       Bonnie’s Share        X     Thirteen Years              X          Monthly\n       = 50%                       Brian’s Credited Service at            Benefit\n                                   Retirement, i.e., Maturity\n\nSee Benson, 545 N.W.2d at 255 (stating denominator is “the total years of\n\nbenefits accrued at maturity”); Heath-Clark, 2016 WL 2753779, at *6 (“The\n\nBenson formula is used to value and divide the portion of the defined benefit\n\naccrued during the parties’ marriage ‘in relation to the total years of benefits\n\naccrued at maturity.’” (emphasis added) (citation omitted)).\n\n       B.      Appreciation of Marital Home\n\n       During the marriage, the home’s assessed value appreciated by $54,915.\n\nThe district court divided the appreciation equally, ordering Brian to pay Bonnie\n\n$27,457.50.     Brian appeals the court’s “equal division” of the home’s marital\n\nappreciation in value. He seeks a pre-division setoff for his “extraordinary efforts\n\nmade for the increase of an asset,” i.e., the value of his work, or “sweat equity,”\n\nhe expended to remodel the home during the marriage.\n\n       Bonnie responds such a setoff would be contrary to Fennelly, which the\n\ndistrict court quoted: “It is important to remember marriage does not come with a\n\nledger.     Spouses agree to accept one another ‘for better or worse.’              Each\n10\n   Providing for the entry of a QDRO on remand is sufficient relief as to Bonnie’s request\nher award should be designated “as a separate interest in the defined-benefit plan.” In\nBenson, the court stated the “actual earnings attributable to [Bonnie’s] separate\nretirement interest cannot be awarded to [her] as a separate value, because they are\nneeded to generate the value of the ultimate ‘defined’ benefit.” See 545 N.W.2d at 257.\n11\n   We decline Bonnie’s request we modify to “require that she be designated as a\nsurviving spouse.” The Benson court stated the percentage formula “properly allocates\nthe risk between the parties.” See 545 N.W.2d at 255.\n\f                                           14\n\n\nperson’s total contributions to the marriage cannot be reduced to a dollar\n\namount. Many contributions are incapable of calculation, such as love, support,\n\nand companionship.”       737 N.W.2d at 97.         We find Bonnie’s position more\n\npersuasive. The parties shared the residence for about fourteen years. Bonnie\n\ncontributed to its upkeep, paid the cable and utilities bills, and participated in the\n\ndesign and implementation of the remodeling projects, especially the landscaping\n\nportion.     During the marriage the parties shared “love, support, and\n\ncompanionship.” See id. Accordingly, we affirm the court’s equal division of the\n\nmarital home’s appreciation in value. See In re Marriage of Terry, No. 11-1903,\n\n2012 WL 2819333, at *5 (Iowa Ct. App. July 11, 2012) (recognizing “it does not\n\nmatter whether the property has appreciated fortuitously or by the efforts of the\n\nparties”).\n\n        C.    Equalization Payment\n\n       The court ordered Brian to pay Bonnie $30,477 “for equalization of the\n\ndebts and assets acquired during the marriage, valued at the time of trial.” Both\n\nparties seek an adjustment of this payment on appeal.12\n\n       We agree with Brian that a correction of the court’s mathematical error\n\nshows an equalization payment of $15,238.50 was intended by the court to\n\nachieve “equalization of the debts and assets acquired during the marriage.”13\n\n\n12\n   In her cross-appeal, Bonnie claims the equalization payment “should be increased by\n$10,000 to at least reduce the disparity resulting from the division of household contents\naccumulated during the marriage.” The district court rejected this assertion, finding:\n“The record does not contain detail on the value of household items.” Based on this\nfinding, the court ruled “the parties have equitably divided the household items” and did\nnot adjust the equalization payment. On de novo review, we agree with the district court.\n13\n    Using the court’s valuations, we find Brian’s $15,819 in assets and $32,238 in debts\nresults in a preliminary net worth of -$16,419.00. Bonnie’s $32,520 in assets and\n$79,426 in debts results in a preliminary net worth of -$46,896. Brian paying Bonnie\n\f                                           15\n\n\n       Brian also argues the court incorrectly assigned two categories within\n\nBonnie’s debt as marital debt. First, he claims Bonnie’s credit-card debt solely\n\nfor her attorney fees is not marital debt. We agree. The trial court ordered\n\nBonnie to pay her own attorney fees, and attorney fees “incurred in dissolution\n\nproceedings are not marital debt.”14 Hansen, 733 N.W.2d at 703 (stating it was\n\nerror to characterize attorney fees as marital debt and adjusting equalization\n\npayment accordingly). Thus, in the chart below we use the court’s valuations but\n\ndisallow the $15,200 debt for Bonnie’s attorney fees.\n\n       Additionally, Brian challenges the student-loan debt for Bonnie’s son and\n\nBonnie’s own student-loan debt, claiming those amounts are not marital debts.\n\nAt trial, Bonnie admitted Brian had no obligation to support her children; thus, this\n\ncase differs from cases where the student’s own parents are divorcing. The\n\ncollege debt for Bonnie’s son—as can be separated out on the record before\n\nus—is not marital debt.         Bonnie testified a $2297 student-loan bill was\n\n“exclusively related” to her son’s college education. Therefore, we disallow that\n\namount in the chart below.\n\n       Brian also seeks to remove $19,355.50—Bonnie’s personal loan. Bonnie\n\ntestified the loan went toward her son’s education, her pursuit of a master’s\n\ndegree, and family expenses, such as her son’s wedding. Because the record\n\ndoes not segregate the total into separate categories and because we believe\n\n\n\n$15,238.50 to equalize the parties’ assets and debts would result in both parties leaving\nthe marriage with an ending net worth of -$31,657.50.\n14\n   On cross-appeal, Bonnie claims the district court erred in denying her request for an\naward of trial attorney fees. District courts have considerable discretion in awarding\nattorney fees in dissolution cases. In re Marriage of Giles, 338 N.W.2d 544, 546 (Iowa\nCt. App. 1983). We find no abuse of discretion and affirm the district court. See id.\n\f                                        16\n\n\nthe debt Bonnie incurred during the marriage for her own education is a marital\n\nexpense, we decline Brian’s request to further reduce Bonnie’s debt.\n\n      For her part, Bonnie claims the court failed to account for the additional\n\nequity in the home—$8482—created as the parties paid down the mortgage over\n\nthe course of the marriage. Because Brian is keeping the home and is also\n\ntaking over the existing mortgage debt—a debt that decreases his overall net\n\nworth—we agree equity requires Brian to include the $8482 in principal reduction\n\nduring the marriage as his marital asset.\n\n      Based on the above revisions, we modify Brian’s equalization payment to\n\nBonnie to $10,731, as shown below:\n\n                                              Brian       Bonnie\n                Parties’ Assets             $15,819.00   $32,530.00\n                Reduced Mortgage             $8,482.00\n                Parties’ Debts          -$32,238.00 -$79,426.00\n                Attorney Fee Debt                        $15,200.00\n                Son’s Education Debt                      $2,297.00\n                Net Worth                   -$7,937.00 -$29,399.00\n                Equalization            -$10,731.00      $10,731.00\n                Ending Net Worth        -$18,668.00 -$18,668.00\n\nD.    Summary\n\n      To recap, as to Brian’s 401(k)—the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings\n\nPlan—we modify the decree and remand for entry of a QDRO directing Rockwell\n\nCollins to pay benefits to Bonnie as a marital property settlement in the amount\n\nof $424,522. Next, we modify the decree and remand for the entry of a QDRO\n\ndirecting Rockwell Collins to pay pension benefits to Bonnie as a marital property\n\f                                         17\n\n\nsettlement under the following formula: 50% of the gross monthly or lump-sum\n\nbenefit payable at the date of distribution to Brian multiplied by the “service\n\nfactor.” The numerator of the service factor is thirteen, and the denominator is\n\nBrian’s total credited service at retirement as used in calculating Brian’s benefit.\n\nWe affirm the district court’s order requiring Brian to pay Bonnie $27,457.50 for\n\nher share of the marital home’s increase in value during the marriage.            We\n\nmodify the decree and remand for entry of an order requiring Brian to pay Bonnie\n\n$10,731.00 to equalize the parties’ assets and debts.\n\n       IV.    Appellate Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Both parties request attorney fees on appeal. An award of attorney fees is\n\nnot a matter of right but rests in our discretion. See McDermott, 827 N.W.2d at 687.\n\nIn exercising our discretion, “we consider ‘the needs of the party seeking the award,\n\nthe ability of the other party to pay, and the relative merits of the appeal.’”    Id.\n\n(citation omitted).   Here, both parties were partially successful on appeal.\n\nAdditionally, their yearly earnings are roughly equivalent. Considering these factors,\n\nwe decline to award appellate attorney fees and split the costs equally.\n\n       AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\n\f",

We affirm the district court’s\n\norder that Brian compensate Bonnie for an equal share of the increase in the\n\nvalue of the marital home. But we modify the decree in several ways, including\n\nchanges to the division of Brian’s retirement assets and a recalculation of the\n\nequalization payment. We remand for the district court to modify the decree in\n\naccordance with this decision.\n\n         I.      Facts and Prior Proceedings\n\n         Brian and Bonnie met in the summer of 1998. At that time, Bonnie and\n\nher two sons were living in Tennessee. They moved to Iowa the next summer to\n\nlive with Brian. Bonnie and Brian were married on September 28, 2002; they had\n\nno children together. Bonnie’s children graduated from high school and left the\n\nmarital home by 2008.\n\n         Brian is fifty-eight years old. He has a community-college degree and\n\nworks as a senior mechanical engineer at Rockwell Collins. He has been a full-\n\ntime employee there for thirty-six years, earning more than $105,000 per year.\n\n         Bonnie is fifty-one years old. In 1986, she graduated with a bachelor’s\n\ndegree in secondary education—physical education and health. In 2002, Bonnie\n\nstarted online classes toward her masters of health administration degree, but\n\nshe had not completed the program by the time of trial.                When Bonnie left\n\nTennessee in 1999, she was earning $65,000 per year; she found a job in Iowa\n\npaying $20,000 less per year. It took her about ten years in Iowa to obtain a\n\n1\n    The district court granted Bonnie’s request to return to using her maiden name.\n\f                                        3\n\n\nsalary level somewhat equivalent to her Tennessee income, despite the fact she\n\nconsistently maintained full-time employment. She now earns $90,200 per year\n\nas a senior administrator overseeing seventy staff members in two Unity Point\n\nClinics.\n\n       In January 1989, Brian paid $55,498 to purchase the home that became\n\nthe marital residence. Thus, Brian owned the home for a decade before Bonnie\n\nmoved to Iowa. The home was assessed at $119,585 when the parties married,\n\nand in June 2003 the mortgage principal was $39,539. In 2004, Brian and a\n\nfriend completed a major addition on the home, with Brian utilizing his\n\nexceptional woodworking skills.    Brian testified the addition was intended to\n\naccommodate the whole family—the boys had separate bedrooms, he and\n\nBonnie had a larger master bedroom, and a bigger living room allowed them “to\n\nspread out.” Brian also updated existing areas, and the parties purchased new\n\nappliances. Bonnie had input on the project’s design and planning. She also\n\ncleaned up construction debris and landscaped the property. At the time of trial,\n\nthe home’s assessed value had increased from its 2003 value by $54,915—to\n\n$174,500, and the joint mortgage’s principal balance had been reduced to\n\n$31,057, i.e., an $8482 pay down of mortgage debt during the marriage.\n\n       During the parties’ marriage, they agreed to keep separate accounts for\n\ntheir banking and credit cards. Bonnie covered her children’s health insurance\n\nfor two years during the marriage; thereafter, Brian covered them under his\n\nRockwell Collins health insurance.2 The parties agreed Bonnie would pay all the\n\n\n2\n Bonnie explained her ex-husband’s employment was sporadic; thus, he was unable to\nprovide consistent health insurance for their sons.\n\f                                            4\n\n\nchildren’s expenses—school, clothing, and medical.             Sometimes she worked\n\npart-time jobs, in addition to her full-time job, to meet her expenses.3 Brian\n\nbought birthday and Christmas presents for the children; “gave them money\n\nevery so often”; and when their high school graduations approached, Brian\n\nvoluntarily started a 529 college savings plan for them.4 See 26 U.S.C. § 529\n\n(allowing states to establish qualified tuition programs where person may\n\ncontribute for designated beneficiaries). At trial, Bonnie admitted Brian had no\n\nlegal obligation to support her sons.\n\n       The parties also agreed to a specific plan to divide their living expenses.\n\nAs of 2003, any loans secured by the real estate were joint loans. But Brian\n\nwould pay for the mortgage, tax, and insurance on the house, while Bonnie paid\n\nfor the utilities (electric, water, sewer), the home telephone—until it was\n\ndiscontinued—everyone’s cell phones, cable television, and groceries. Bonnie\n\npaid for landscaping materials and provided the majority of the landscaping labor.\n\nInitially, Bonnie and Brian each paid for their own car insurance. But when they\n\nmarried in 2002, Brian added Bonnie to his car insurance. Bonnie also provided\n\nnon-economic contributions to the family such as cooking and cleaning. After\n\nBrian hurt his shoulder, Bonnie also shoveled the snow.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Bonnie explained Brian had a better cash flow than she did during the marriage: “[Brian\nhad fewer] bills coming out monthly. Again, he was making double my salary at several\nportions of the marriage. And I had more expenses going out of my pocket for my\nchildren.”\n4\n  At the time of trial, Bonnie’s two sons were ages twenty-six and twenty-eight, and the\ntotal balance in Brian’s 529 accounts had been reduced to around $1500. Brian has a\nclose relationship with the son living in the Cedar Rapids area, who has graduated from\ncollege. Brian considers that son’s child to be Brian’s grandchild. Brian plans to roll his\ncurrent 529 balances into a new 529 plan for the benefit of this grandchild.\n\f                                        5\n\n\n      Brian filed a dissolution petition on December 11, 2013, and trial\n\ncommenced on August 20, 2015. The parties presented financial information to\n\nthe court, including the value of various retirement accounts and the marital\n\nhome. Brian proposed Bonnie “should receive zero of the equity in the marital\n\nresidence” because he had made all the mortgage payments and because the\n\nparties “have always had separate accounts.” He also asked to be awarded his\n\nhealth savings account, his defined-benefit plan, and his 401(k)—valued at over\n\n$1 million.   Brian agreed Bonnie should retain her $73,000 in retirement\n\naccounts, and he urged the court to hold each party responsible for their own\n\ndebts—Brian ($32,238) and Bonnie ($79,426).\n\n      In contrast, Bonnie asked the court to award her a marital portion of both\n\nBrian’s 401(k) and his defined-benefit plan by the entry of qualified domestic\n\nrelations orders (QDROs). She requested a portion of the marital home’s equity\n\nand appreciation, pointing out the mortgage was joint debt. Bonnie sought a\n\nproperty-equalization payment and trial attorney fees.\n\n      The district court entered its decree dissolving the marriage and dividing\n\nthe parties’ assets on February 14, 2016. The court ordered each party to pay\n\nhis or her attorney fees and required Bonnie to pay the remaining court costs.\n\nBoth parties filed post-trial motions, which the court summarily denied. Brian\n\nnow appeals, and Bonnie cross-appeals.\n\n      II.     Scope and Standards of Review\n\n      We review the decree de novo. See In re Marriage of McDermott, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676 (Iowa 2013). After examining the entire record, we adjudicate\n\nanew the property-distribution issues. See id. We give weight to the district\n\f                                          6\n\n\ncourt’s findings of fact, particularly with regard to witness credibility, though such\n\nfindings are not binding. See id.\n\n       III.     Division of Property\n\n       When a couple divorces, Iowa law requires an equitable division of marital\n\nproperty. Iowa Code § 598.21(5) (2013); see also In re Marriage of Hansen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1832878\"><a href=\"/opinion/1832878/in-re-marriage-of-hansen/\"><span class=\"volume\">733</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (Iowa 2007). First, we determine what property held by the\n\nparties is subject to division. See In re Marriage of Fennelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1705431\"><a href=\"/opinion/1705431/in-re-marriage-of-fennelly-breckenfelder/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102\n\n(Iowa 2007). Second, considering the factors in Iowa Code section 598.21(5),\n\nwe decide how to equitably divide that property. See id. The property division\n\ndoes not need to be equal or follow a certain percentage; rather, this court makes\n\nan equitable award under the circumstances. See In re Marriage of Hoak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233783\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233783/in-re-marriage-of-hoak/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (Iowa 1985). “[W]e will disturb a district court determination\n\nonly when there has been a failure to do equity.” In re Marriage of Mauer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (Iowa 2016); see also In re Marriage of Vieth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1313112\"><a href=\"/opinion/1313112/in-re-marriage-of-vieth/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n641 (Iowa Ct. App. 1999) (“[W]e give strong deference to the trial court which,\n\nafter sorting through the economic details of the parties, made a fair division\n\nsupported by the record.”).\n\n       We, like the district court, consider the parties’ property in three broad\n\ncategories—retirement assets, home appreciation, and equalization payment.\n\n       A.       Retirement Assets\n\n       The district court awarded Bonnie her three retirement accounts totaling\n\n$73,211.      The parties do not challenge that award.      It is the district court’s\n\ncalculation and distribution of Brian’s more substantial retirement assets that the\n\nparties debate on appeal.\n\f                                         7\n\n\n      Generally, a property division involving retirement benefits evolves in two\n\nsteps.

Brian’s 401(k) was\n\nworth $138,983 when the parties married in September 2002. The district court\n\nfound, as of the August 2015 trial date, the value of this account was $1,061,238.\n\nThe court set aside Brian’s premarital value of $138,983 and ordered the asset\n\n“divided by way of a QDRO. Bonnie shall be awarded $387,916.50.” On appeal,\n\nBonnie claims the court should not have set aside the premarital value to Brian,\n\nasserting her numerous contributions to the marriage require that amount to be\n\nincluded. Bonnie also points out she “worked over a ten-year period to return to\n\nher previous earning capacity,” which she claims limited her ability to save for\n\nretirement.   But Brian testified Bonnie’s limited savings is a result of her\n\ninappropriate spending on vehicles and other items during the marriage.\n\n      Premarital property is not automatically excluded from the marital estate\n\nlike gifted or inherited property.

After our de\n\nnovo review, we agree with the district court’s finding that under the\n\ncircumstances of this marriage, where both parties were gainfully employed\n\nbefore they married and each retained some financial independence during the\n\nmarriage, equity requires the premarital value to be set aside to Brian. Thus, the\n\nmarital value of Brian’s 401(k) is $922,255, as specifically found by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n         Next, Brian and Bonnie both request an adjustment to the $922,255\n\nmarital value. Brian asks us to reduce the value before calculating a distribution\n\namount to Bonnie, claiming a fixed dollar amount is inequitable where the gross\n\nvalue allegedly decreased after the trial and before entry of the decree. We are\n\nnot persuaded. First, no evidence in the record supports his argument. Second,\n\nthe trial date is a reasonable time to set the value.

Brian’s pension is a defined-benefit plan.8\n\nGenerally, it is “desirable to divide a defined-benefit plan by using the percentage\n\nmethod,” which is the method the district court used here. See id. Under the\n\npercentage method, an award is effectuated by a QDRO, “which is paid if and\n\nwhen the benefits mature.” Id. at 250; see also Faber v. Herman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2077676\"><a href=\"/opinion/2077676/faber-v-herman/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n7 (Iowa 2007) (stating non-member spouse receives “a share of the pension\n\nbenefits at some point in the future when they become payable to the\n\npensioner”).\n\n       The district court ordered Brian’s pension to be “divided using the Benson\n                                             [ ]\nformula, (Bonnie shall receive one-half 9 of the fractional portion of the plan\n\ncalculated by using [thirteen] years as the numerator, and the years of\n\nassets $849,044. One-half of this difference is $424,522. When we deduct $424,522\nfrom $922,255, Brian’s remaining marital 401(k) is $497,733. When we add $424,522 to\nBonnie’s existing $73,211 in marital retirement assets, her marital retirement assets now\nlikewise total $497,733. We note Brian’s total 401(k) assets are $636,716 after the\npremarital set off is included.\n8\n   Depending on the formula used by Rockwell Collins for its pension plan, the future\nbenefit payable to Brian may contain two variables: (1) years of service and (2) earnings.\nSee Benson, 545 N.W.2d at 255.\n9\n   “Absent agreement to the contrary, and there is none, [Bonnie] should receive half of\nthe marital share” of Brian’s defined-benefit plan. See In re Marriage of Kasik, No. 15-\n1713, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4543981</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. Aug. 31, 2016). As found by the district\ncourt, Bonnie’s share is 50%.\n\f                                          11\n\n\ncontribution as the denominator).” Thus, although the decree made no provision\n\nfor the entry of a QDRO as to this asset, the district court used the “service factor\n\npercentage method,” which “divides the pension according to a percentage\n\nmultiplied by a factor based on the member’s service during the marriage and the\n\nmember’s total service.” See Faber, 731 N.W.2d at 8.\n\n       On appeal, Brian argues for revision of both the numerator and the\n\ndenominator. Before addressing his specific arguments, we turn to the analysis\n\nin Benson. In that case, our supreme court discussed the valuation and division\n\nof a defined-benefit plan in the context of a marital property settlement. 545\n\nN.W.2d at 255-57. Benson instructed: “[T]he numerator [is] the number of years\n\nduring the marriage [the employee] accrued benefits under the pension plan . . .\n\nand the denominator [is] the total number of year’s [the employee’s] benefits\n\naccrued prior to maturity (i.e., receipt of payments upon retirement.)” See id. at\n\n255 (stating this fraction recognizes the percentage of the employee’s pension\n\n“attributable to the parties’ joint marital efforts”). In other words, this fraction is\n\n“based on the member’s service during the marriage and the member’s total\n\nservice.” Faber, 731 N.W.2d at 8.\n\n       Brian asks us to reduce the numerator from thirteen years to 3.75 years—\n\nthe time he was both married and contributing to the plan. We are not persuaded\n\nto do so. Brian and Bonnie were married at the end of September 2002, and as\n\nof December 31, 2002, Brian had credited service in his pension of 23.58 years.\n\nRockwell Collins discontinued employee contributions on September 30, 2006.\n\nBrian’s credited service from December 31, 2002, to September 30, 2006, was\n\n3.75 years.   Thus, at the date Brian’s contributions ended, his total credited\n\f                                        12\n\n\nservice was 27.33 years. Nevertheless, Brian was “covered” by the plan during\n\nhis entire marriage, as shown by the fact Brian’s credited service when he\n\nreaches age sixty-two will be 39.9167 years.         See Heath-Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2753779</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (stating Benson formula is correctly set forth by using a numerator\n\nof “the number of quarters covered during the marriage period,” i.e., the date of\n\nmarriage through the date of the dissolution decree). We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s numerator—thirteen years.\n\n      As to the denominator, Brian faults the court’s description, claiming the\n\ndenominator includes the period of time after he stopped contributing to the plan\n\nand until the plan matures in the future. We agree the district court did not fully\n\ndefine the denominator portion of the fraction, and therefore, we modify the\n\ndecree to conform to the Benson formula. See id. at *9 (Danilson, J., dissenting)\n\n(stating confusion as to the correct denominator under Benson “is compounded\n\nby other [supreme court cases] using different terminology to describe the\n\ndenominator”).\n\n      Under Benson, the denominator is the number of years Brian was\n\n“covered” by the plan “prior to conclusion (maturity)).” See 545 N.W.2d at 255;\n\nsee also Faber, 731 N.W.2d at 8 (stating Benson denominator is “the member’s\n\ntotal service”); Heath-Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2753779</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (majority opinion)\n\n(upholding, under Benson, a provision stating “the denominator is the Member’s\n\ntotal quarters of service covered by [the employer’s pension plan] and used in\n\ncalculating the Member’s benefit”).

Appreciation of Marital Home\n\n       During the marriage, the home’s assessed value appreciated by $54,915.\n\nThe district court divided the appreciation equally, ordering Brian to pay Bonnie\n\n$27,457.50.     Brian appeals the court’s “equal division” of the home’s marital\n\nappreciation in value. He seeks a pre-division setoff for his “extraordinary efforts\n\nmade for the increase of an asset,” i.e., the value of his work, or “sweat equity,”\n\nhe expended to remodel the home during the marriage.\n\n       Bonnie responds such a setoff would be contrary to Fennelly, which the\n\ndistrict court quoted: “It is important to remember marriage does not come with a\n\nledger.     Spouses agree to accept one another ‘for better or worse.’              Each\n10\n   Providing for the entry of a QDRO on remand is sufficient relief as to Bonnie’s request\nher award should be designated “as a separate interest in the defined-benefit plan.” In\nBenson, the court stated the “actual earnings attributable to [Bonnie’s] separate\nretirement interest cannot be awarded to [her] as a separate value, because they are\nneeded to generate the value of the ultimate ‘defined’ benefit.” See 545 N.W.2d at 257.\n11\n   We decline Bonnie’s request we modify to “require that she be designated as a\nsurviving spouse.” The Benson court stated the percentage formula “properly allocates\nthe risk between the parties.” See 545 N.W.2d at 255.\n\f                                           14\n\n\nperson’s total contributions to the marriage cannot be reduced to a dollar\n\namount. Many contributions are incapable of calculation, such as love, support,\n\nand companionship.”       737 N.W.2d at 97.         We find Bonnie’s position more\n\npersuasive. The parties shared the residence for about fourteen years. Bonnie\n\ncontributed to its upkeep, paid the cable and utilities bills, and participated in the\n\ndesign and implementation of the remodeling projects, especially the landscaping\n\nportion.     During the marriage the parties shared “love, support, and\n\ncompanionship.” See id. Accordingly, we affirm the court’s equal division of the\n\nmarital home’s appreciation in value. See In re Marriage of Terry, No. 11-1903,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2819333</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (Iowa Ct. App. July 11, 2012) (recognizing “it does not\n\nmatter whether the property has appreciated fortuitously or by the efforts of the\n\nparties”).\n\n        C.    Equalization Payment\n\n       The court ordered Brian to pay Bonnie $30,477 “for equalization of the\n\ndebts and assets acquired during the marriage, valued at the time of trial.” Both\n\nparties seek an adjustment of this payment on appeal.12\n\n       We agree with Brian that a correction of the court’s mathematical error\n\nshows an equalization payment of $15,238.50 was intended by the court to\n\nachieve “equalization of the debts and assets acquired during the marriage.”13\n\n\n12\n   In her cross-appeal, Bonnie claims the equalization payment “should be increased by\n$10,000 to at least reduce the disparity resulting from the division of household contents\naccumulated during the marriage.” The district court rejected this assertion, finding:\n“The record does not contain detail on the value of household items.” Based on this\nfinding, the court ruled “the parties have equitably divided the household items” and did\nnot adjust the equalization payment. On de novo review, we agree with the district court.\n13\n    Using the court’s valuations, we find Brian’s $15,819 in assets and $32,238 in debts\nresults in a preliminary net worth of -$16,419.00. Bonnie’s $32,520 in assets and\n$79,426 in debts results in a preliminary net worth of -$46,896. Brian paying Bonnie\n\f                                           15\n\n\n       Brian also argues the court incorrectly assigned two categories within\n\nBonnie’s debt as marital debt. First, he claims Bonnie’s credit-card debt solely\n\nfor her attorney fees is not marital debt. We agree. The trial court ordered\n\nBonnie to pay her own attorney fees, and attorney fees “incurred in dissolution\n\nproceedings are not marital debt.”14 Hansen, 733 N.W.2d at 703 (stating it was\n\nerror to characterize attorney fees as marital debt and adjusting equalization\n\npayment accordingly). Thus, in the chart below we use the court’s valuations but\n\ndisallow the $15,200 debt for Bonnie’s attorney fees.\n\n       Additionally, Brian challenges the student-loan debt for Bonnie’s son and\n\nBonnie’s own student-loan debt, claiming those amounts are not marital debts.\n\nAt trial, Bonnie admitted Brian had no obligation to support her children; thus, this\n\ncase differs from cases where the student’s own parents are divorcing. The\n\ncollege debt for Bonnie’s son—as can be separated out on the record before\n\nus—is not marital debt.         Bonnie testified a $2297 student-loan bill was\n\n“exclusively related” to her son’s college education. Therefore, we disallow that\n\namount in the chart below.\n\n       Brian also seeks to remove $19,355.50—Bonnie’s personal loan. Bonnie\n\ntestified the loan went toward her son’s education, her pursuit of a master’s\n\ndegree, and family expenses, such as her son’s wedding. Because the record\n\ndoes not segregate the total into separate categories and because we believe\n\n\n\n$15,238.50 to equalize the parties’ assets and debts would result in both parties leaving\nthe marriage with an ending net worth of -$31,657.50.\n14\n   On cross-appeal, Bonnie claims the district court erred in denying her request for an\naward of trial attorney fees. District courts have considerable discretion in awarding\nattorney fees in dissolution cases.

Because Brian is keeping the home and is also\n\ntaking over the existing mortgage debt—a debt that decreases his overall net\n\nworth—we agree equity requires Brian to include the $8482 in principal reduction\n\nduring the marriage as his marital asset.\n\n      Based on the above revisions, we modify Brian’s equalization payment to\n\nBonnie to $10,731, as shown below:\n\n                                              Brian       Bonnie\n                Parties’ Assets             $15,819.00   $32,530.00\n                Reduced Mortgage             $8,482.00\n                Parties’ Debts          -$32,238.00 -$79,426.00\n                Attorney Fee Debt                        $15,200.00\n                Son’s Education Debt                      $2,297.00\n                Net Worth                   -$7,937.00 -$29,399.00\n                Equalization            -$10,731.00      $10,731.00\n                Ending Net Worth        -$18,668.00 -$18,668.00\n\nD.    Summary\n\n      To recap, as to Brian’s 401(k)—the Rockwell Collins Retirement Savings\n\nPlan—we modify the decree and remand for entry of a QDRO directing Rockwell\n\nCollins to pay benefits to Bonnie as a marital property settlement in the amount\n\nof $424,522. Next, we modify the decree and remand for the entry of a QDRO\n\ndirecting Rockwell Collins to pay pension benefits to Bonnie as a marital property\n\f                                         17\n\n\nsettlement under the following formula: 50% of the gross monthly or lump-sum\n\nbenefit payable at the date of distribution to Brian multiplied by the “service\n\nfactor.” The numerator of the service factor is thirteen, and the denominator is\n\nBrian’s total credited service at retirement as used in calculating Brian’s benefit.\n\nWe affirm the district court’s order requiring Brian to pay Bonnie $27,457.50 for\n\nher share of the marital home’s increase in value during the marriage.            We\n\nmodify the decree and remand for entry of an order requiring Brian to pay Bonnie\n\n$10,731.00 to equalize the parties’ assets and debts.\n\n       IV.    Appellate Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Both parties request attorney fees on appeal. An award of attorney fees is\n\nnot a matter of right but rests in our discretion. See McDermott, 827 N.W.2d at 687.\n\nIn exercising our discretion, “we consider ‘the needs of the party seeking the award,\n\nthe ability of the other party to pay, and the relative merits of the appeal.’”    Id.\n\n(citation omitted).   Here, both parties were partially successful on appeal.\n\nAdditionally, their yearly earnings are roughly equivalent. Considering these factors,\n\nwe decline to award appellate attorney fees and split the costs equally.\n\n       AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
