SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n\n     With the best of intentions, in order to increase the en-\n\nrollment of certain favored classes of minority students, the\n\nUniversity of Texas School of Law (\"the law school\") discrimi-\n\nnates in favor of those applicants by giving substantial racial\n\npreferences in its admissions program.   The beneficiaries of this\n\n\n                                 2\n\fsystem are blacks and Mexican Americans, to the detriment of\n\nwhites and non-preferred minorities.       The question we decide to-\n\nday in No. 94-50664 is whether the Fourteenth Amendment permits\n\nthe school to discriminate in this way.\n\n     We hold that it does not.        The law school has presented no\n\ncompelling justification, under the Fourteenth Amendment or Su-\n\npreme Court precedent, that allows it to continue to elevate some\n\nraces over others, even for the wholesome purpose of correcting\n\nperceived racial imbalance in the student body.       \"Racial prefer-\n\nences appear to 'even the score' . . . only if one embraces the\n\nproposition that our society is appropriately viewed as divided\n\ninto races, making it right that an injustice rendered in the\n\npast to a black man should be compensated for by discriminating\n\nagainst a white.\"     City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n\n469, 528 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment).\n\n     As a result of its diligent efforts in this case, the dis-\n\ntrict court concluded that the law school may continue to impose\n\nracial preferences.    See Hopwood v. Texas, 861 F. Supp. 551 (W.D.\n\nTex. 1994).     In No. 94-50664, we reverse and remand, concluding\n\nthat the law school may not use race as a factor in law school\n\nadmissions.     Further, we instruct the court to reconsider the\n\nissue of damages in accordance with the legal standards we now\n\nexplain.   In No. 94-50569, regarding the denial of intervention\n\nby two black student groups, we dismiss the appeal for want of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f                                     I.\n\n                                     A.\n\n     The University of Texas School of Law is one of the nation's\n\nleading law schools, consistently ranking in the top twenty.\n\nSee, e.g., America's Best Graduate Schools, U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT\n\nMar. 20, 1995, at 84 (national survey ranking of seventeenth).\n\nAccordingly, admission to the law school is fiercely competitive,\n\nwith over 4,000 applicants a year competing to be among the ap-\n\nproximately 900 offered admission to achieve an entering class of\n\nabout 500 students.       Many of these applicants have some of the\n\nhighest grades and test scores in the country.\n\n     Numbers are therefore paramount for admission.            In the early\n\n1990's, the law school largely based its initial admissions deci-\n\nsions upon an applicant's so-called Texas Index (\"TI\") number, a\n\ncomposite of undergraduate grade point average (\"GPA\") and Law\n\nSchool Aptitude Test (\"LSAT\") score.1          The law school used this\n\nnumber as a matter of administrative convenience in order to rank\n\ncandidates and to predict, roughly, one's probability of success\n\nin law school.     Moreover, the law school relied heavily upon such\n\nnumbers to estimate the number of offers of admission it needed\n\nto make in order to fill its first-year class.\n\n\n     1\n        The formulae were written by the Law School Data Assembly Service\naccording to a prediction derived from the success of first-year students in\npreceding years. As the LSAT was determined to be a better predictor of\nsuccess in law school, the formulae for the class entering in 1992 accorded an\napproximate 60% weight to LSAT scores and 40% to GPA.\n\n      The formula for students with a three-digit LSAT, see infra note 5, was\ncalculated as: LSAT + (10)(GPA) = TI. For students with a two-digit LSAT,\nthe formula was: (1.25)LSAT + (10)GPA = TI.\n\n                                      4\n\f     Of course, the law school did not rely upon numbers alone.\n\nThe admissions office necessarily exercised judgment in inter-\n\npreting the individual scores of applicants, taking into consid-\n\neration factors such as the strength of a student's undergraduate\n\neducation, the difficulty of his major, and significant trends in\n\nhis own grades and the undergraduate grades at his respective\n\ncollege (such as grade inflation).               Admissions personnel also\n\nconsidered what qualities each applicant might bring to his law\n\nschool class.       Thus, the law school could consider an applicant's\n\nbackground, life experiences, and outlook.                    Not surprisingly,\n\nthese hard-to-quantify factors were especially significant for\n\nmarginal candidates.2\n\n     Because of the large number of applicants and potential ad-\n\nmissions    factors,    the   TI's     administrative        usefulness       was   its\n\nability to sort candidates.            For the class entering in 1992SSthe\n\nadmissions group at issue in this caseSSthe law school placed the\n\ntypical applicant in one of three categories according to his TI\n\nscores:    \"presumptive      admit,\"      \"presumptive    deny,\"   or     a    middle\n\n\"discretionary zone.\"         An applicant's TI category determined how\n\nextensive a review his application would receive.\n\n     Most,    but    not   all,     applicants   in    the    presumptive       admit\n\ncategory     received      offers    of    admission     with    little       review.\n\n\n     2\n        Notably, but of less significance to this appeal, residency also had a\nstrong, if not often determinant, effect. Under Texas law in 1992, the law\nschool was limited to a class of 15% non-residents, and the Board of Regents\nrequired an entering class of at least 500 students. The law school therefore\nhad to monitor offers to non-residents carefully, in order not to exceed this\nquota, while at the same time maintaining an entering class of a manageable\nsize.\n\n                                          5\n\fProfessor    Stanley      Johanson,    the   Chairman   of   the    Admissions\n\nCommittee,    or   Dean    Laquita    Hamilton,   the   Assistant    Dean    for\n\nAdmissions, reviewed these files and downgraded only five to ten\n\npercent to the discretionary zone because of weaknesses in their\n\napplications, generally a non-competitive major or a weak under-\n\ngraduate education.\n\n      Applicants in the presumptive denial category also received\n\nlittle consideration.       Similarly, these files would be reviewed by\n\none or two professors, who could upgrade them if they believed that\n\nthe TI score did not adequately reflect potential to compete at the\n\nlaw school.    Otherwise, the applicant was rejected.\n\n      Applications in the middle range were subjected to the most\n\nextensive scrutiny.         For all applicants other than blacks and\n\nMexican Americans, the files were bundled into stacks of thirty,\n\nwhich were given to admissions subcommittees consisting of three\n\nmembers of the full admissions committee.                Each subcommittee\n\nmember, in reviewing the thirty files, could cast a number of\n\nvotesSStypically from nine to eleven3SSamong the thirty files.\n\nSubject to the chairman's veto, if a candidate received two or\n\nthree votes, he received an offer; if he garnered one vote, he was\n\nput on the waiting list; those with no votes were denied admission.\n\n      Blacks and Mexican Americans were treated differently from\n\nother candidates, however.            First, compared to whites and non-\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The number of votes would change over the course of the admissions\nseason in order to achieve the appropriate number of offers.\n\n                                        6\n\fpreferred minorities,4 the TI ranges that were used to place them\n\ninto the three admissions categories were lowered to allow the law\n\nschool to consider and admit more of them.             In March 1992, for\n\nexample, the presumptive TI admission score for resident whites and\n\nnon-preferred minorities was 199.5         Mexican Americans and blacks\n\nneeded a TI of only 189 to be presumptively admitted.6                    The\n\ndifference in the presumptive-deny ranges is even more striking.\n\nThe presumptive denial score for \"nonminorities\" was 192; the same\n\nscore for blacks and Mexican Americans was 179.\n\n     While these cold numbers may speak little to those unfamiliar\n\n\n      4\n        As blacks and Mexican Americans were the only two minority categories\ngranted preferential treatment in admissions, it is inaccurate to say that the\nlaw school conducted separate admissions programs for \"minorities\" and \"non-\nminorities.\" While the law school application form segregated racial and\nethnic classification into seven categoriesSS\"Black/African American,\" \"Native\nAmerican,\" \"Asian American,\" \"Mexican American,\" \"Other Hispanic\" (meaning\nnon-Mexican descent), \"White,\" and \"Other (describe)\"SSonly American blacks\nand Mexican Americans received the benefit of the separate admissions track.\n      Thus, for example, the law school decided that a black citizen of Nige-\nria would not get preferential treatment, but a resident alien from Mexico,\nwho resided in Texas, would. Likewise, Asians, American Indians, Americans\nfrom El Salvador and Cuba, and many others did not receive a preference.\n      It is important to keep the composition of these categories in mind.\nFor the sake of simplicity and readability, however, we sometimes will refer\nto two broad categories: \"whites\" (meaning Texas residents who were whites\nand non-preferred minorities) and \"minorities\" (meaning Mexican Americans and\nblack Americans).\n     5\n        Because of a recent change in the grading scale of the LSAT, the law\nschool in 1992 had applicants who had taken an earlier LSAT scored on a 10-to-\n48 scale and others who had taken a later one scored on a 120-to-180 scale.\nEquivalence calculations were used to compare scores received on the two\nscales. For example, TI numbers of 199 (three-digit LSAT) and 87 (two-digit\nLSAT) were equivalent. For the sake of simplicity, we use three-digit numbers\nthroughout this opinion.\n     6\n        In March 1992, the resident Mexican American and black presumptive\nadmit lines were in parity, but they had not started that way. The initial\npresumptive admit TI's were 196 for Mexican Americans and 192 for blacks.\nThus, initially, blacks received preferential treatment over Mexican Americans\nby having a lower hurdle to cross to get into the discretionary zone. In\nMarch, Professor Johanson lowered the Mexican American TI in order to admit\nmore of this group.\n\n                                      7\n\fwith the pool of applicants, the results demonstrate that the\n\ndifference in the two ranges was dramatic.                   According to the law\n\nschool, 1992 resident white applicants had a mean GPA of 3.53 and\n\nan LSAT of 164.        Mexican Americans scored 3.27 and 158; blacks\n\nscored 3.25 and 157.       The category of \"other minority\" achieved a\n\n3.56 and 160.7\n\n\n\n     These     disparate   standards          greatly    affected      a   candidate's\n\nchance of admission.         For example, by March 1992, because the\n\npresumptive denial score for whites was a TI of 192 or lower, and\n\nthe presumptive admit TI for minorities was 189 or higher, a\n\nminority candidate with a TI of 189 or above almost certainly would\n\n\n     7\n         The median scores of the 1992 class are as follows:\n\n\nEthnicity                      Resident                 Nonresident\n\n                               GPA/LSAT                 GPA/LSAT\n\nAll students                   3.52/162                 3.61/164\nWhite                          3.56/164                 3.72/166\nBlack                          3.30/158                 3.30/156\nMexican American               3.24/157                 3.38/174*\nOther minority                 3.58/160                 3.77/157\n*Only two matriculated applicants.\n\n\n     In 1992, the LSAT's national distribution was approximately as follows:\n     LSAT                Percentile                     2-Digit LSAT\n     166                    94%                            43\n     164                    91%                            41\n     162                    88%                            40\n     160                    83%                            39\n     158                    78%                            38\n     156                    71%                            36\n\n\nOn the basis of these percentiles, one-half of the law school's white resident\nmatriculants were in the top 9% of all test-takers, one-half of the resident\nMexican Americans were in approximately the top 25% of test-takers, and one-\nhalf of the resident blacks were in the top 22% of test-takers.\n\n                                          8\n\fbe admitted, even though his score was considerably below8 the\n\nlevel     at   which     a   white    candidate         almost   certainly   would     be\n\nrejected.      Out of the pool of resident applicants who fell within\n\nthis range (189-192 inclusive), 100% of blacks and 90% of Mexican\n\nAmericans, but only 6% of whites, were offered admission.9\n\n     The stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet\n\nan \"aspiration\" of admitting a class consisting of 10% Mexican\n\nAmericans and 5% blacks, proportions roughly comparable to the\n\npercentages of those races graduating from Texas colleges. The law\n\nschool found meeting these \"goals\" difficult, however, because of\n\nuncertain      acceptance         rates    and    the    variable      quality   of   the\n\napplicant      pool.10       In    1992,    for    example,      the   entering   class\n\ncontained 41 blacks and 55 Mexican Americans, respectively 8% and\n\n10.7% of the class.\n\n     In addition to maintaining separate presumptive TI levels for\n\nminorities and whites, the law school ran a segregated application\n\n\n\n      8\n        To illustrate this difference, we consider the four plaintiffs in this\ncaseSSCheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David Rogers. For\na student similarly situated to Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8, to avoid presump-\ntive denial as a white, i.e., to obtain a TI of 193 or above, her LSAT had to\nbe at least a 155, a score in approximately the top 32% of test-takers. If\nshe were black (thus, needing a 180 TI), she would have had to score a 142 on\nthe LSAT, ranking her only in the top 80%. Likewise, a student similar to\nCarvell, who had a 3.28 GPA, would have needed a \"white\" LSAT of 160 (top 17%)\nand a \"black\" 147 (top 63%). A student like Rodgers with a 3.13 would have\nneeded either a 162 (top 12%) as a white or 149 as a black (top 56%). Fi-\nnally, a student like Elliott with a 2.98 GPA would have needed a 163 (top\n10%) or 150 (top 53%), respectively.\n     9\n        According to the plaintiffs, 600-700 higher-scoring white residents\nwere passed over before the first blacks were denied admission. There is no\nspecific finding on this assertion, and though the law school does not appear\nto refute it, we do not rely upon it in making our decision.\n     10\n        Thus, the law school constantly had to adjust its TI range over the\ncourse of the admissions season to reach a desired mix. See supra note 6.\n\n                                             9\n\fevaluation process. Upon receiving an application form, the school\n\ncolor-coded it according to race.                If a candidate failed to\n\ndesignate his race, he was presumed to be in a nonpreferential\n\ncategory.    Thus, race was always an overt part of the review of any\n\napplicant's file.\n\n      The   law    school   reviewed    minority     candidates    within    the\n\napplicable discretionary range differently from whites. Instead of\n\nbeing evaluated and compared by one of the various discretionary\n\nzone subcommittees, black and Mexican American applicants' files\n\nwere reviewed by a minority subcommittee of three, which would meet\n\nand   discuss     every   minority    candidate.       Thus,    each   of   these\n\ncandidates' files could get extensive review and discussion.                  And\n\nwhile the minority subcommittee reported summaries of files to the\n\nadmissions    committee     as   a   whole,    the   minority   subcommittee's\n\ndecisions were \"virtually final.\"\n\n      Finally, the law school maintained segregated waiting lists,\n\ndividing applicants by race and residence.               Thus, even many of\n\nthose minority applicants who were not admitted could be set aside\n\nin \"minority-only\" waiting lists.             Such separate lists apparently\n\nhelped the law school maintain a pool of potentially acceptable,\n\nbut marginal, minority candidates.11\n\n\n\n                                       B.\n\n\n      11\n        The district court did not find, nor is the record clear on, how\nthese different classes of waiting list candidates were compared in the event\nthe law school made last-minute admissions decisions. The record does show\nthat the school carefully monitored the race of applicants in filling the last\nopenings in late spring and early summer.\n\n                                       10\n\f     Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David\n\nRogers     (the   \"plaintiffs\")   applied   for   admission   to   the   1992\n\nentering law school class.        All four were white residents of Texas\n\nand were rejected.\n\n     The plaintiffs were considered as discretionary zone candi-\n\ndates.12    Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8 and an LSAT of 39 (equivalent\n\nto a three-digit LSAT of 160), had a TI of 199, a score barely\n\nwithin the presumptive-admit category for resident whites, which\n\nwas 199 and up.       She was dropped into the discretionary zone for\n\nresident whites (193 to 198), however, because Johanson decided her\n\neducational       background   overstated   the   strength    of   her   GPA.\n\nCarvell, Elliott, and Rogers had TI's of 197, at the top end of\n\nthat discretionary zone.          Their applications were reviewed by\n\nadmissions subcommittees, and each received one or no vote.\n\n\n\n                                     II.\n\n     The plaintiffs sued primarily under the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment; they also claimed derivative\n\nstatutory violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 and of title VI\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (\"title VI\").13\n\nThe plaintiffs' central claim is that they were subjected to\n\n\n     12\n        The district court discussed in detail the plaintiffs' qualifications\nand their rejections. See 861 F. Supp. at 564-67.\n      13\n         The defendants are the State of Texas; the University of Texas Board\nof Regents; the members of the board, named but sued in their official capaci-\nties; the University of Texas at Austin; the President of the university, sued\nin his official capacity; the University of Texas School of Law; the dean of\nthe law school, sued in his official capacity; and the Chairman of the Admis-\nsions Committee, sued in his official capacity.\n\n                                      11\n\funconstitutional   racial    discrimination   by   the    law   school's\n\nevaluation of their admissions applications.       They sought injunc-\n\ntive and declaratory relief and compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n     After a bench trial, the district court held that the school\n\nhad violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. 861 F. Supp.\n\nat 579.   The plaintiffs' victory was pyrrhic at best, however, as\n\nthe court refused to enjoin the law school from using race in\n\nadmissions decisions or to grant damages beyond a one-dollar\n\nnominal award to each plaintiff.    The district court, however, did\n\ngrant declaratory relief and ordered that the plaintiffs be allowed\n\nto apply again without paying the requisite fee.         Id. at 583.\n\n     The district court began by recognizing the proper constitu-\n\ntional standard under which to evaluate the admissions program:\n\nstrict scrutiny.   Id. at 568.   As it was undisputed that the school\n\nhad treated applicants disparately based upon the color of their\n\nskin, the court asked whether the law school process (1) served a\n\ncompelling government interest and (2) was narrowly tailored to the\n\nachievement of that goal.     Under the first prong of the test, the\n\ncourt held that two of the law school's five proffered reasons met\n\nconstitutional muster:      (1) \"obtaining the educational benefits\n\nthat flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body\" and\n\n(2) \"the objective of overcoming past effects of discrimination.\"\n\nId. at 571.\n\n     Significantly, on the second justification, the court rejected\n\nthe plaintiffs' argument that the analysis of past discrimination\n\nshould be limited to that of the law school; instead, the court\n\n\n                                  12\n\fheld that the State of Texas's \"institutions of higher education\n\nare inextricably linked to the primary and secondary schools in the\n\nsystem.\"    Id.14   Accordingly, the court found that Texas's long\n\nhistory of racially discriminatory practices in its primary and\n\nsecondary schools in its not-too-distant past had the following\n\npresent effects at UT law: \"the law school's lingering reputation\n\nin the minority community, particularly with prospective students,\n\nas a 'white' school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the\n\nstudent body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile\n\nenvironment for minorities.\"         Id. at 572.     The court also noted\n\nthat \"were the Court to limit its review to the University of\n\nTexas, the Court would still find a 'strong evidentiary basis for\n\nconcluding that remedial action is necessary.'\"                 Id. (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      The   court   next   evaluated    whether   the   Texas    program   was\n\nnarrowly tailored to further these goals.          Id. at 573.     Applying a\n\nfour-factor test devised by the Supreme Court, the court held only\n\npart of the 1992 admissions scheme unconstitutional.              Those parts\n\nthat gave minorities a \"plus,\" that is, the component of the\n\nadmissions program that treated candidates' TI scores differently\n\nbased upon race, was upheld.        Id. at 578.\n\n      The court held, however, that differential treatment was not\n\nallowed where candidates of different races were not compared at\n\n\n\n      14\n         Because of this conclusion, the district court examined at length the\nhistory of race relations in Texas and discrimination in its schools. 861\nF. Supp. at 554-57.\n\n\n                                       13\n\fsome point in the admission process.         Thus, the court struck down\n\nthe school's use of separate admissions committees for applications\n\nin the discretionary zone, id. at 578-79, and in dictum speculated\n\nthat presumptive denial lines would not pass muster, as many white\n\ncandidates would get no review, while similarly situated minorities\n\nwould, id. at 576 n.71.\n\n      Though it declared that the law school's 1992 admissions\n\nprogram violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights, the court\n\ngranted little relief.       First, the court did not order that the\n\nplaintiffs be admitted to the law school.         Instead, it used what it\n\nsaw as analogous title VII caselaw on burden-shifting to hold that\n\nwhile the state had committed a constitutional violation, the\n\nplaintiffs had the ultimate burden of proving damages. Id. at 579-\n\n80.   The court then found that the defendants had proffered a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying the plaintiffs\n\nadmission and that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of\n\nshowing that they would have been admitted but for the unlawful\n\nsystem.   Id. at 582.\n\n      Moreover, the court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto prospective injunctive relief, because \"of the law school's\n\nvoluntary change to a procedure, which on paper and from the\n\ntestimony, appears to remedy the defects the Court has found in the\n\n1992 procedure.\" Id.15 To pass muster under the court's reasoning,\n\n\n\n      15\n         Shortly before trial, apparently in response to the filing of this\nlawsuit, the law school modified its 1992 admissions practices to fit the\ndistrict court's view of the proper constitutional system. See id. at 582\nn.87.\n\n                                      14\n\fthe law school simply had to have one committee that at one time\n\nduring the process reviewed all applications and did not establish\n\nseparate TI numbers to define the presumptive denial categories.\n\nIn other words, if the law school applied the same academic\n\nstandards, but had commingled the minority review in the discre-\n\ntionary zone with the review of whites, its program would not have\n\nbeen struck down.       The same admissions result would occur, but the\n\nprocess would be \"fair.\"        Id.\n\n     Finally, the court determined that the only appropriate relief\n\nwas a declaratory judgment and an order allowing the plaintiffs to\n\nreapply to the school without charge.          Id. at 582-83.      No compensa-\n\ntory or punitive damages, the court reasoned, could be awarded\n\nwhere the plaintiffs had proven no harm.               Moreover, the court\n\nreasoned   that    as   the   law   school   had   promised   to    change   its\n\nadmissions program by abandoning the two-committee system, no\n\nprospective injunctive relief was justified.\n\n\n\n                                      III.\n\n     The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause \"is to\n\nprevent    the    States   from     purposefully    discriminating     between\n\nindividuals on the basis of race.\"           Shaw v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816,\n\n2824 (1993) (citing Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976)).\n\nIt seeks ultimately to render the issue of race irrelevant in\n\ngovernmental decisionmaking.          See Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429,\n\n432 (1984) (\"A core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do\n\naway with all governmentally imposed discrimination.\")(footnote\n\n\n                                       15\n\fomitted).\n\n      Accordingly, discrimination based upon race is highly suspect.\n\n\"Distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are\n\nby their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are\n\nfounded upon the doctrine of equality,\" and \"racial discriminations\n\nare in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\n\n. . . .\"     Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943).\n\nHence, \"[p]referring members of any one group for no reason other\n\nthan race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake.\n\nThis the Constitution forbids.\" Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\n\n438 U.S. 265, 307 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.); see also Loving\n\nv. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 11 (1967); Brown v. Board of Educ., 347\n\nU.S. 483, 493-94 (1954).        These equal protection maxims apply to\n\nall races.     Adarand Constructors v. Peña, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 2111\n\n(1995).\n\n      In order to preserve these principles, the Supreme Court\n\nrecently has required that any governmental action that expressly\n\ndistinguishes between persons on the basis of race be held to the\n\nmost exacting scrutiny.       See, e.g., id. at 2113; Loving, 388 U.S.\n\nat 11.    Furthermore, there is now absolutely no doubt that courts\n\nare to employ strict scrutiny16 when evaluating all racial classifi-\n\ncations, including those characterized by their proponents as\n\n\n\n\n      16\n         In their initial brief on appeal, the defendants argued that interme-\ndiate scrutiny is appropriate here. In a supplemental brief filed to address\nthe subsequent opinion in Adarand, they now acknowledge that strict scrutiny\nis the appropriate test.\n\n                                      16\n\f\"benign\" or \"remedial.\"17\n\n      Strict scrutiny is necessary because the mere labeling of a\n\nclassification by the government as \"benign\" or \"remedial\" is\n\nmeaningless.      As Justice O'Connor indicated in Croson:\n\n      Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justifications\n      for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of\n      determining what classifications are \"benign\" or\n      \"remedial\" and what classifications are in fact motivated\n      by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple\n      racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny\n      is to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by assuring\n      that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important\n      enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test\n      also ensures that the means chosen \"fit\" this compelling\n      goal so closely that there is little or no possibility\n      that the motive for the classification was illegitimate\n      racial prejudice or stereotype.\n\nId. at 493 (plurality opinion).\n\n      Under the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions:\n\n(1) Does the racial classification serve a compelling government\n\ninterest, and (2) is it narrowly tailored to the achievement of\n\nthat goal?      Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2111, 2117.            As the Adarand\n\nCourt      emphasized,   strict   scrutiny   ensures   that    \"courts   will\n\nconsistently give racial classifications . . . detailed examination\n\nboth as to ends and as to means.\"          Id.18\n\n\n      17\n         Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2112-13 (overruling Metro Broadcasting, Inc.\nv. F.C.C., 497 U.S. 547 (1990), insofar as it applied intermediate scrutiny to\ncongressionally mandated \"benign\" racial classifications); City of Richmond v.\nJ.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 495 (1989) (plurality opinion) (\"the standard\nof review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of\nthose burdened or benefited by a particular classification\"); id. at 520\n(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Wygant v.

The\n\nrights established are personal rights.\"                Shelley v. Kraemer, 334\n\nU.S. 1, 22 (1948).19            Thus, the Court consistently has rejected\n\narguments conferring benefits on a person based solely upon his\n\nmembership in a specific class of persons.20\n\n     With these general principles of equal protection in mind, we\n\nturn to the specific issue of whether the law school's consider-\n\nation     of   race   as   a    factor   in    admissions   violates      the   Equal\n\nProtection Clause.             The district court found both a compelling\n\nremedial and a non-remedial justification for the practice.\n\n     First, the court approved of the non-remedial goal of having\n\na diverse student body, reasoning that \"obtaining the educational\n\nbenefits that flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student\n\n\n\n(...continued)\ntest, it underscores the presumptive unconstitutionality of racial classifica-\ntions. \"By requiring strict scrutiny of racial classifications, we require\ncourts to make sure that a government classification based on race, which 'so\nseldom provide[s] a relevant basis for disparate treatment,' Fullilove [v.\nKlutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 534 (1980)], (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legiti-\nmate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race.\" 115 S.

Supp. at 571.          Second, the\n\ncourt determined that the use of racial classifications could be\n\njustified as a remedy for the \"present effects at the law school of\n\npast discrimination in both the University of Texas system and the\n\nTexas educational system as a whole.\"             Id. at 573.\n\n\n\n                                       A.\n\n                                       1.\n\n     Justice     Powell's   separate     opinion    in   Bakke   provided     the\n\noriginal impetus for recognizing diversity as a compelling state\n\ninterest in higher education.         In that case, Allan Bakke, a white\n\nmale, was denied admission to the Medical School of the University\n\nof California at Davis, a state-run institution. Claiming that the\n\nState   had    discriminated   against      him   impermissibly     because    it\n\noperated two separate admissions programs for the medical school,\n\nhe brought suit under the state constitution, title VI, and the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.\n\n     Under     the   medical   school's     admissions    system,    the   white\n\napplicants, who comprised the majority of the prospective students,\n\napplied    through    the   general    admissions     program.       A   special\n\nadmissions program was reserved for members of \"minority groups\" or\n\ngroups designated as \"economically and/or educationally disadvan-\n\ntaged.\"       The university set aside sixteen of the one hundred\n\npositions in the entering class for candidates from the special\n\nprogram.\n\n\n                                       19\n\f     The California Supreme Court struck down the program on equal\n\nprotection grounds, enjoined any consideration of race in the\n\nadmissions process, and ordered that Bakke be admitted. The United\n\nStates Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part in an\n\nopinion announced by Justice Powell.        438 U.S. at 271-72 (opinion\n\nof Powell, J.).     The Court reached no consensus on a justification\n\nfor its result, however.        Six Justices filed opinions, none of\n\nwhich garnered more than four votes (including the writer's).           The\n\ntwo major opinionsSSone four-Justice opinion by Justices Brennan,\n\nWhite, Marshall, and Blackmun and one by Justice Stevens in which\n\nChief     Justice   Burger    and   Justices   Stewart   and     Rehnquist\n\njoinedSSreflected completely contrary views of the law.\n\n     While Justice Powell found the program unconstitutional under\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause and affirmed Bakke's admission, Justice\n\nStevens declined to reach the constitutional issue and upheld\n\nBakke's admission under title VI.         Justice Powell also concluded\n\nthat the California Supreme Court's proscription of the consider-\n\nation of race in admissions could not be sustained.            This became\n\nthe judgment of the Court, as the four-Justice opinion by Justice\n\nBrennan    opined   that   racial   classifications   designed   to   serve\n\nremedial purposes should receive only intermediate scrutiny. These\n\nJustices would have upheld the admissions program under this\n\nintermediate scrutiny, as it served the substantial and benign\n\npurpose of remedying past societal discrimination.\n\n     Hence, Justice Powell's opinion has appeared to represent the\n\n\"swing vote,\" and though, in significant part, see id. at 272 n.*,\n\n\n                                     20\n\fit was joined by no other Justice, it has played a prominent role\n\nin subsequent debates concerning the impact of Bakke.21               In the\n\npresent case, the significance of Justice Powell's opinion is its\n\ndiscussion of compelling state interests under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.    See id. at 305-15.       Specifically, after Justice Powell\n\nrecognized    that    the    proper    level    of   review    for    racial\n\nclassifications is strict scrutiny, id. at 305-06, he rejected and\n\naccepted respective justifications for the school's program as\n\n\"substantial enough to support the use of a suspect classifica-\n\ntion,\" id. at 306.           Notably, because the first step in\n\nreviewing an affirmative action program is a determination of the\n\nstate's interests at stake,22 it often is the determinative step.\n\nJustice Powell outlined the four state interests proffered by the\n\nBakke defendants:\n\n     The special admissions program purports to serve the\n     purposes of: (i) \"reducing the historic deficit of\n     traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools\n     and in the medical profession,\"; (ii) countering the\n     effects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing the\n     number of physicians who will practice in communities\n     currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the educational\n     benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student\n     body.\n\n\n\n     21\n         See, e.g., Vincent Blasi, Bakke as Precedent: Does Mr. Justice\nPowell Have a Theory?, 67 CAL. L. REV. 21, 24 (1979) (arguing that Bakke's\nprecedential force is governed by the common conclusions of Justices Powell\nand Stevens, though it is erroneous to conclude that Powell's opinion has\n\"controlling significance on all questions\"); Robert G. Dixon, Jr., Bakke: A\nConstitutional Analysis, 67 CAL. L. REV. 69 (1979) (Justice Powell's\n\"tiebreaking opinion . . . has acquired wide pragmatic appeal.\").\n     22\n        As affirmative action programs are by definition purposeful classifi-\ncations by race, they do not present the problem of governmental action that\nis facially neutral but has a disparate impact and is motivated by race. See\nCity of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252\n(1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).\n\n                                      21\n\fId. at 305-06 (emphasis added, citation and footnote omitted).\n\n       Justice Powell reasoned that the second and third justifica-\n\ntionsSSremedying     societal    discrimination      and   providing     role\n\nmodelsSSwere never appropriate.23         He determined that any remedial\n\njustification was limited to eliminating \"identified discrimina-\n\ntion\" with \"disabling effects.\"           Id. at 307 (citing the school\n\ndesegregation cases).      He specifically emphasized that a particu-\n\nlarized finding of a constitutional or statutory violation must be\n\npresent before a remedy is justified.         He determined not only that\n\nsuch findings were not present in Bakke, but that the medical\n\nschool was not even in a position to make such findings.               Id. at\n\n309.\n\n       Justice Powell further reasoned that diversity is a sufficient\n\njustification for limited racial classification.            Id. at 311-16.\n\n\"[The attainment of a diverse student body] clearly is a constitu-\n\ntionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education.\"\n\nId. at 311.     He argued that diversity of minorities' viewpoints\n\nfurthered \"academic freedom,\" an interest under the Constitution.\n\nWhile acknowledging that \"academic freedom\" does not appear as a\n\nconstitutional right, he argued that it had \"long . . . been viewed\n\nas a special concern of the First Amendment.\"           Id. at 312.24\n\n\n\n      23\n         The Supreme Court subsequently has agreed with that position. See\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 274-76 (plurality opinion). The district court a quo\nerred in suggesting that societal discrimination is constitutionally cogniza-\nble. See 861 F. Supp. at 570 n.56, 571 n.60.\n       24\n        See also Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957) (Frank-\nfurter, J., concurring in result) (recognizing four separate components of\n\"academic freedom\").\n\n                                     22\n\f       Justice Powell presented this \"special concern\" as in tension\n\nwith    the   Fourteenth   Amendment.       \"Thus,   in   arguing   that   its\n\nuniversities must be accorded the right to select those students\n\nwho will contribute the most to the 'robust exchange of ideas,'\n\npetitioner invokes a countervailing constitutional interest, that\n\nof the First Amendment.\"      Id. at 313.25    The Justice then concluded\n\nthat\n\n       [a]n otherwise qualified medical student with a particu-\n       lar background))whether it be ethnic, geographic,\n       culturally advantaged or disadvantaged))may bring to a\n       professional school of medicine experiences, outlooks,\n       and ideas that enrich the training of its student body\n       and better equip its graduates to render with understand-\n       ing their vital service to humanity.\n\nId. at 314 (footnote omitted).        Justice Powell therefore approved\n\nof a consideration of ethnicity as \"one element in a range of\n\nfactors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of\n\na heterogeneous student body.\"        Id.\n\n       The next step for Justice Powell was to decide whether the\n\nmedical school's program was necessary to further the goal of\n\ndiversity.     He said it was not.      As the program made race the only\n\ndetermining factor for a certain number of the open spots that had\n\n\n\n       25\n         Saying that a university has a First Amendment interest in this con-\ntext is somewhat troubling. Both the medical school in Bakke and, in our\ncase, the law school are state institutions. The First Amendment generally\nprotects citizens from the actions of government, not government from its\ncitizens.\n      Significantly, Sweezy involved a person who was called before the Attor-\nney General of New Hampshire to answer for alleged subversive activities. He\ndeclined on First Amendment grounds to answer questions about a lecture he had\ndelivered at the University of New Hampshire. While Justice Frankfurter spoke\nof a university's interest in openness and free inquiry, it was plainly\nthrough the First Amendment rights of individual scholars. 354 U.S. at 262,\n266-67 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result).\n\n                                     23\n\fbeen set aside, it did not further full diversity but only a\n\nconception of that term limited to race.\n\n     Justice Powell speculated that a program in which \"race or\n\nethnic background may be deemed a 'plus' in a particular appli-\n\ncant's file, yet does not insulate the individual from comparison\n\nwith all the other candidates for the available seats,\" might pass\n\nmuster.    Id. at 317.   The Justice did not define what he meant by\n\na \"plus,\" but he did write that a \"plus\" program would be one in\n\nwhich an\n\n     applicant who loses out to another candidate receiving a\n     'plus' on the basis of ethnic background will not have\n     been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat\n     simply because he was not the right color or had the\n     wrong surname.   It would only mean that his combined\n     qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjec-\n     tive factors, did not outweigh those of another appli-\n     cant. His qualifications would have been weighted fairly\n     and competitively, and he would have no basis to com-\n     plaint of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amend-\n     ment.\n\nId. at 318.\n\n     Under this conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, a program\n\nthat considered a host of factors that include race would be\n\nconstitutional, even if an applicant's race \"tipped the scales\"\n\namong qualified applicants.      What a school could not do is to\n\nrefuse to compare applicants of different races or establish a\n\nstrict quota on the basis of race.     In sum, Justice Powell found\n\nthe school's program to be an unconstitutional \"quota\" system, but\n\nhe intimated that the Constitution would allow schools to continue\n\nto use race in a wide-ranging manner.\n\n\n\n\n                                  24\n\f                                       2.\n\n     Here, the plaintiffs argue that diversity is not a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest under superseding Supreme Court precedent.\n\nInstead, they believe that the Court finally has recognized that\n\nonly the remedial use of race is compelling.           In the alternative,\n\nthe plaintiffs assert that the district court misapplied Justice\n\nPowell's Bakke standard, as the law school program here uses race\n\nas a strong determinant rather than a mere \"plus\" factor and, in\n\nany case, the preference is not narrowly applied.             The law school\n\nmaintains, on the other hand, that Justice Powell's formulation in\n\nBakke is law and must be followedSSat least in the context of\n\nhigher education.\n\n     We agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or\n\nethnicity by the law school for the purpose of achieving a diverse\n\nstudent body is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.    Justice Powell's argument in Bakke garnered only his\n\nown vote and has never represented the view of a majority of the\n\nCourt in Bakke or any other case.           Moreover, subsequent Supreme\n\nCourt decisions regarding education state that non-remedial state\n\ninterests will never justify racial classifications.            Finally, the\n\nclassification of persons on the basis of race for the purpose of\n\ndiversity frustrates, rather than facilitates, the goals of equal\n\nprotection.\n\n     Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on\n\nthis issue.     While he announced the judgment, no other Justice\n\njoined in     that   part   of   the   opinion   discussing   the   diversity\n\n\n                                       25\n\frationale.   In Bakke, the word \"diversity\" is mentioned    nowhere\n\nexcept in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion.     In fact, the\n\nfour-Justice opinion, which would have upheld the special admis-\n\nsions program under intermediate scrutiny, implicitly rejected\n\nJustice Powell's position.    See 438 U.S. at 326 n.1 (Brennan,\n\nWhite, Marshall, and Blackmun JJ., concurring in the judgment in\n\npart and dissenting) (\"We also agree with Mr. Justice POWELL that\n\na plan like the \"Harvard\" plan . . . is constitutional under our\n\napproach, at least so long as the use of race to achieve an\n\nintegrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of\n\npast discrimination.\") (emphasis added).    Justice Stevens declined\n\nto discuss the constitutional issue.   See id. at 412 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\n     Thus, only one Justice concluded that race could be used\n\nsolely for the reason of obtaining a heterogenous student body. As\n\nthe Adarand Court states, the Bakke Court did not express a\n\nmajority view and is questionable as binding precedent.   115 S. Ct.\n\nat 2109 (\"The Court's failure in Bakke . . . left unresolved the\n\nproper analysis for remedial race-based government action.\").\n\n     Since Bakke, the Court has accepted the diversity rationale\n\nonly once in its cases dealing with race.   Significantly, however,\n\nin that case, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications\n\nComm'n, 497 U.S. 547, 564-65 (1990), the five-Justice majority\n\nrelied upon an intermediate scrutiny standard of review to uphold\n\nthe federal program seeking diversity in the ownership of broad-\n\ncasting facilities.   In Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2112-13, the Court\n\n\n                                26\n\fsquarely rejected intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review\n\nfor racial classifications, and Metro Broadcasting is now specifi-\n\ncally overruled to the extent that it was in conflict with this\n\nholding.   Id. at 2113.     No case since Bakke has accepted diversity\n\nas a compelling state interest under a strict scrutiny analysis.\n\n     Indeed,    recent    Supreme      Court   precedent   shows   that   the\n\ndiversity interest will not satisfy strict scrutiny. Foremost, the\n\nCourt appears to have decided that there is essentially only one\n\ncompelling    state   interest    to    justify   racial   classifications:\n\nremedying past wrongs.        In Croson, 488 U.S. at 493 (plurality\n\nopinion), the Court flatly stated that \"[u]nless [racial classifi-\n\ncations] are strictly reserved for remedial settings, they may in\n\nfact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics\n\nof racial hostility.\" (emphasis added).26\n\n     Justice O'Connor, in her Adarand-vindicated dissent in Metro\n\nBroadcasting, joined by Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Kennedy,\n\nexplained this position:\n\n     Modern equal protection has recognized only one [compel-\n\n\n     26\n        See also Milwaukee County Pavers Ass'n v. Fielder, 922 F.2d 419, 422\n(7th Cir.) (\"The whole point of Croson is that disadvantage, diversity, or\nother grounds favoring minorities will not justify governmental racial dis-\ncrimination . . .; only a purpose of remedying discrimination against minori-\nties will do so.\") (emphasis added), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 954 (1991).\n      Notably, Justice Scalia rejected the use of racial classifications \"in\norder (in a broad sense) 'to ameliorate the effects of past discrimination.'\"\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (quoting\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 476-77). He, however, suggested one other possible com-\npelling state interest: a social emergency. He opined that \"where state or\nlocal action is at issue, only a social emergency rising to the level of immi-\nnent danger to life and limb\" will justify racial classifications. Croson,\n488 U.S. at 521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). While such an interest\nis probably consistent with the widely criticized holdings of Hirabayashi v.\nUnited States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), and Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S.\n214 (1944), plainly such an interest is not presented in this case.\n\n                                       27\n\f       ling state] interest: remedying the effects of racial\n       discrimination. The interest in increasing the diversity\n       of broadcast viewpoints is clearly not a compelling\n       interest. It is simply too amorphous, too insubstantial,\n       and too unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing\n       racial classifications.\n\n497 U.S. at 612 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).             Indeed, the majority\n\nin Metro Broadcasting had not claimed otherwise and decided only\n\nthat such an interest was \"important.\"           Justice Thomas, who joined\n\nthe Court after Metro Broadcasting was decided, roundly condemned\n\n\"benign\" discrimination in his recent Adarand opinion, in which he\n\nsuggests that the diversity rationale is inadequate to meet strict\n\nscrutiny.     See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring\n\nin part and concurring in judgment).27\n\n       In short, there has been no indication from the Supreme Court,\n\nother than Justice Powell's lonely opinion in Bakke, that the\n\nstate's interest in diversity constitutes a compelling justifica-\n\ntion    for   governmental    race-based      discrimination.         Subsequent\n\nSupreme Court caselaw strongly suggests, in fact, that it is not.\n\n       Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\n\nuse of      race   in   admissions   for    diversity   in   higher   education\n\n\n       27\n         The law school places much reliance upon Justice O'Connor's concur-\nrence in Wygant for the proposition that Justice Powell's Bakke formulation is\nstill viable. In her 1986 Wygant opinion, in the context of discussing Jus-\ntice Powell's opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that \"although its precise con-\ntours are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has\nbeen found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in the context of higher educa-\ntion, to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that inter-\nest.\" 476 U.S. at 286 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment).\n      The law school's argument is not persuasive. Justice O'Connor's state-\nment is purely descriptive and did not purport to express her approval or\ndisapproval of diversity as a compelling interest. Her subsequent statements\noutlined above in Croson and Metro Broadcasting suggest strongly that reliance\nupon this statement in Wygant is unjustified.\n\n                                       28\n\fcontradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection.\n\nDiversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.                   It\n\ntreats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals.                It may\n\nfurther remedial purposes but, just as likely, may promote improper\n\nracial stereotypes, thus fueling racial hostility.\n\n       The use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply\n\nachieves a student body that looks different.            Such a criterion is\n\nno more rational on its own terms than would be choices based upon\n\nthe physical size or blood type of applicants.             Thus, the Supreme\n\nCourt has long held that governmental actors cannot justify their\n\ndecisions solely because of race.          See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at\n\n496 (plurality opinion);          Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307 (opinion of\n\nPowell, J.).\n\n       Accordingly, we see the caselaw as sufficiently established\n\nthat   the   use   of   ethnic    diversity   simply     to    achieve   racial\n\nheterogeneity, even as part of the consideration of a number of\n\nfactors, is unconstitutional.          Were we to decide otherwise, we\n\nwould contravene precedent that we are not authorized to challenge.\n\n       While the use of race per se is proscribed, state-supported\n\nschools may reasonably consider a host of factors))some of which\n\nmay have some correlation with race))in making admissions deci-\n\nsions.    The federal courts have no warrant to intrude on those\n\nexecutive and legislative judgments unless the distinctions intrude\n\non   specific   provisions   of    federal    law   or   the   Constitution.\n\n       A university may properly favor one applicant over another\n\nbecause of his ability to play the cello, make a downfield tackle,\n\n\n                                      29\n\for   understand   chaos     theory.      An    admissions   process   may   also\n\nconsider an applicant's home state or relationship to school\n\nalumni.      Law schools specifically may look at things such as\n\nunusual or substantial extracurricular activities in college, which\n\nmay be atypical factors affecting undergraduate grades.                  Schools\n\nmay even consider factors such as whether an applicant's parents\n\nattended     college   or        the   applicant's      economic   and   social\n\nbackground.28\n\n      For this reason, race often is said to be justified in the\n\ndiversity context, not on its own terms, but as a proxy for other\n\ncharacteristics that institutions of higher education value but\n\nthat do not raise similar constitutional concerns.29 Unfortunately,\n\nthis approach simply replicates the very harm that the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was designed to eliminate.\n\n      The    assumption     is    that   a    certain   individual    possesses\n\ncharacteristics by virtue of being a member of a certain racial\n\ngroup.      This assumption, however, does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n\"[T]he use of a racial characteristic to establish a presumption\n\nthat the individual also possesses other, and socially relevant,\n\ncharacteristics, exemplifies, encourages, and legitimizes the mode\n\nof thought and behavior that underlies most prejudice and bigotry\n\nin modern America.\"       Richard A. Posner, The DeFunis Case and the\n\n\n      28\n        The law school's admissions program makes no distinction among black\nand Mexican American applicants in an effort to determine which of them, for\nexample, may have been culturally or educationally disadvantaged.\n      29\n        For example, Justice Powell apparently felt that persons with differ-\nent ethnic backgrounds would bring diverse \"experiences, outlooks, and ideas\"\nto the medical school. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 314 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n\n                                         30\n\fConstitutionality of Preferential Treatment of Racial Minorities,\n\n1974 SUP. CT. REV. 12 (1974).\n\n     To believe that a person's race controls his point of view is\n\nto stereotype him.        The Supreme Court, however, \"has remarked a\n\nnumber of      times,   in   slightly   different     contexts,     that    it    is\n\nincorrect     and   legally    inappropriate     to   impute   to     women      and\n\nminorities 'a different attitude about such issues as the federal\n\nbudget, school prayer, voting, and foreign relations.'\" Michael S.\n\nPaulsen, Reverse Discrimination and Law School Faculty Hiring: The\n\nUndiscovered Opinion, 71 TEX. L. REV. 993, 1000 (1993) (quoting\n\nRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 627-28 (1984)).\n\n\"Social scientists may debate how peoples' thoughts and behavior\n\nreflect their background, but the Constitution provides that the\n\ngovernment may not allocate benefits or burdens among individuals\n\nbased on the assumption that race or ethnicity determines how they\n\nact or think.\"      Metro Broadcasting, 497 U.S. at 602 (O'Connor, J.,\n\ndissenting).30\n\n     Instead, individuals, with their own conceptions of life,\n\nfurther diversity of viewpoint.              Plaintiff Hopwood is a fair\n\nexample of an applicant with a unique background.              She is the now-\n\nthirty-two-year-old wife of a member of the Armed Forces stationed\n\n\n     30\n          Thus, to put it simply, under the Equal Protection Clause\n\n     the distribution of benefits and    costs by government on racial or\n     ethnic grounds is impermissible.     Even though it is frequently\n     efficient to sort people by race    or ethnic origin, because racial\n     or ethnic identity may be a good    proxy for functional classifica-\n     tions, efficiency is rejected as    a basis for governmental action\n     in this context.\nPosner, supra, at 22.\n\n                                        31\n\fin San Antonio and, more significantly, is raising a severely\n\nhandicapped child.         Her circumstance would bring a different\n\nperspective to the law school.         The school might consider this an\n\nadvantage to her in the application process, or it could decide\n\nthat her family situation would be too much of a burden on her\n\nacademic performance.\n\n     We do not opine on which way the law school should weigh\n\nHopwood's qualifications; we only observe that \"diversity\" can take\n\nmany forms.       To foster such diversity, state universities and law\n\nschools and other governmental entities must scrutinize applicants\n\nindividually, rather than resorting to the dangerous proxy of\n\nrace.31\n\n     The Court also has recognized that government's use of racial\n\nclassifications serves to stigmatize. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of\n\nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954) (observing that classification on\n\nthe basis of race \"generates a feeling of inferiority\"). While one\n\nmight     argue   that   the   stigmatization   resulting   from   so-called\n\n\n     31\n        We recognize that the use of some factors such as economic or educa-\ntional background of one's parents may be somewhat correlated with race. This\ncorrelation, however, will not render the use of the factor unconstitutional\nif it is not adopted for the purpose of discriminating on the basis of race.\nSee McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279 (1987). As Justice O'Connor indicated in\nHernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352 (1991), which was a challenge under Batson\nv. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), based upon the prosecution's strike of poten-\ntial jurors who spoke Spanish:\n     No matter how closely tied or significantly correlated to race the\n     explanation for a peremptory strike may be, the strike does not\n     implicate the Equal Protection Clause unless it is based on race.\n     That is the distinction between disproportionate effect, which is\n     not sufficient to constitute an equal protection violation, and\n     intentional discrimination, which is.\n\n500 U.S. at 375 (O'Connor, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in the judg-\nment).\n\n\n                                      32\n\f\"benign\" racial classifications is not as harmful as that arising\n\nfrom invidious ones,32 the current Court has now retreated from the\n\nidea that so-called benign and invidious classifications may be\n\ndistinguished.33           As   the        plurality   in   Croson   warned,\n\n\"[c]lassifications based on race carry the danger of stigmatic\n\nharm.     Unless they are reserved for remedial settings, they may in\n\nfact promote notions of racial inferiority and lead to the politics\n\nof racial hostility.\"        488 U.S. at 493.34\n\n\n      32\n         According to one of the four-Justice opinions in Bakke, racial clas-\nsifications stigmatize when \"they are drawn on the presumption that one race\nis inferior to another or because they put the weight of government behind\nracial hatred and separation.\" 438 U.S. at 357-58 (Brennan, White, Marshall,\nand Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nIn Bakke, however, these Justices rejected strict scrutiny because the program\nat issue could not be said to stigmatize as did other racial classifications.\nThese Justices nevertheless recognized that rational-basis scrutiny would not\nbe enough.

To ask whether racial exclusion may not have\n     overriding benefits for both races in particular circumstances is\n     to place the antidiscrimination principle at the mercy of the\n     vagaries of empirical conjecture and thereby free the judge to\n     enact his personal values into constitutional doctrine.\n\nPosner, supra, at 25-26.\n     34\n        See also Adarand, 115 S.

The message from\n     government is written very large when these plans proliferate: a\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                       33\n\f     Finally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the\n\nultimate goal of the Fourteenth Amendment:                the end of racially-\n\nmotivated state action.        Justice Powell's conception of race as a\n\n\"plus\" factor would allow race always to be a potential factor in\n\nadmissions decisionmaking.         While Justice Blackmun recognized the\n\ntension inherent in using race-conscious remedies to achieve a\n\nrace-neutral society, he nevertheless accepted it as necessary.\n\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 405.          Several Justices who, unlike Justices\n\nPowell and Blackmun, are still on the Court, have now renounced\n\ntoleration of this tension, however.             See Croson, 488 U.S. at 495\n\n(plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.) (\"The dissent's watered down\n\nversion of equal protection review effectively assures that race\n\nwill always be relevant in American life, and that the 'ultimate\n\ngoal' of 'eliminat[ing] entirely from government decisionmaking\n\nsuch irrelevant factors as a human being's race . . . will never be\n\nachieved.\")     (quoting    Wygant,    476   U.S.    at    320   (Stevens,   J.,\n\ndissenting)).35\n\n\n(...continued)\ndouble (and softer) standard for admission, a double (and softer) standard for\nhiring, a double (and softer) standard for promotion, a double (and softer)\nstandard for competitive bidding, and so on.

CHI. L. REV. 775, 787 n.38 (1979).\n     35\n          As professor Van Alstyne has argued:\n\n     Rather, one gets beyond racism by getting beyond it now: by a\n     complete, resolute, and credible commitment never to tolerate in\n     one's own life))or in the life or practices of one's\n     government))the differential treatment of other human beings by\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                       34\n\f     In sum, the use of race to achieve a diverse student body,\n\nwhether as a proxy for permissible characteristics, simply cannot\n\nbe a state interest compelling enough to meet the steep standard of\n\nstrict scrutiny.36    These latter factors may, in fact, turn out to\n\nbe substantially correlated with race, but the key is that race\n\nitself not be taken into account.            Thus, that portion of the\n\ndistrict court's opinion upholding the diversity rationale is\n\nreversibly flawed.37\n\n\n\n                                     B.\n\n     We now turn to the district court's determination that \"the\n\nremedial purpose of the law school's affirmative action program is\n\n\n\n(...continued)\n     race. Indeed, that is the great lesson for government itself to\n     teach: in all we do in life, whatever we do in life, to treat any\n     person less well than another or to favor any more than another\n     for being black or white or brown or red, is wrong. Let that be\n     our fundamental law and we shall have a Constitution universally\n     worth expounding.\nVan Alstyne, supra note 34, at 809-10.\n     36\n        Because we have determined that any consideration of race by the law\nschool is constitutionally impermissible if justified by diversity, it is not\nnecessary to determine whether, as plaintiffs argue, the admissions system\nunder which the plaintiffs applied operated as a de facto \"quota\" system\nsimilar to the one struck down in Bakke. We do note that even if a \"plus\"\nsystem were permissible, it likely would be impossible to maintain such a\nsystem without degeneration into nothing more than a \"quota\" program. See\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 378 (\"For purposes of constitutional adjudication, there is\nno difference between [setting aside a certain number of places for minorities\nand using minority status as a positive factor].\") (Brennan, White, Marshall,\nand Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nIndeed, in this case, the law school appeared to be especially adept at\nmeeting its yearly \"goals.\" See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 574 n.67.\n      37\n         Plaintiffs additionally have argued that the law school's program\nwas not narrowly tailored in the diversity context because (1) it failed to\naward preferences to non-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, American\nIndians, or other minorities, and (2) it failed to accord as much weight to\nnon-racial diversity factors, such as religion and socioeconomic background,\nas it did to race.\n\n                                     35\n\fa compelling government objective.\"           861 F. Supp. at 573.          The\n\nplaintiffs argue that the court erred by finding that the law\n\nschool could employ racial criteria to remedy the present effects\n\nof past discrimination in Texas's primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the proper unit for analysis is the law\n\nschool, and the state has shown no recognizable present effects of\n\nthe law school's past discrimination. The law school, in response,\n\nnotes      Texas's   well-documented     history   of   discrimination       in\n\neducation and argues that its effects continue today at the law\n\nschool, both in the level of educational attainment of the average\n\nminority applicant and in the school's reputation.\n\n      In contrast to its approach to the diversity rationale, a\n\nmajority of the Supreme Court has held that a state actor may\n\nracially classify where it has a \"strong basis in the evidence for\n\nits conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\"             Croson, 488\n\nU.S. at 500 (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277 (plurality opinion)).\n\nGenerally, \"[i]n order to justify an affirmative action program,\n\nthe     State   must   show   there    are   'present    effects    of     past\n\ndiscrimination.'\"      Hopwood v. Texas (\"Hopwood I\"),38 21 F.3d 603,\n\n605 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (quoting Podberesky v. Kirwan, 956\n\nF.2d 52, 57 (4th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 115 S.

Moreover, we also must review the\n\ncourt's identification of what types of present effects of past\n\ndiscrimination,     if    proven,   would   be   sufficient   under   strict\n\nscrutiny review.         Finally, where the state actor puts forth a\n\n\n\n      39\n         Unfortunately, the precise scope of allowable state action is of\nsomewhat undefined contours. Indeed, it is not evident whether permitted\nremedial action extends to the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" This\nlanguage, derived from Justice Brennan's opinion in Bakke, 438 U.S. at 362-66,\nappears intended to present little resistance to wide-ranging affirmative\naction plans.\n\n      While Justice Brennan began by stating that schools have a duty\naffirmatively to erase the vestiges of their past discriminatory practices, he\ncompared this duty to the power of Congress to enforce § 1 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment through § 5. He reasoned that under that wide-ranging power, the\nbeneficiaries of such a program need not present proof that they were\ndiscriminated against; a showing that they were in the general class was\nsufficient.\nId. at 363-64. Nor would a school need judicial findings of past\ndiscrimination. Id. at 364. Finally, he argued that such beneficiaries would\nnot even\nhave to show that that school had a history of past discrimination, but need\nonly suggest that they were the victims of general societal discrimination\nthat prevented them from being otherwise qualified to enter the school. Id.\nat 365-66. Hence, under this standard, almost any school could adopt an\naffirmative action plan.\n      There is no question, however, that subsequent Supreme Court opinions,\nnotably Wygant and Croson, have rejected broad state programs that purport to\nbe remedial and that, presumably, would have satisfied Justice Brennan's\nstandard for meeting the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" And some\nmembers of the Court would limit any remedial purpose to the actual victims of\ndiscrimination. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2118 (Scalia, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (\"[G]overnment can never have a 'compelling\ninterest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for\npast racial discrimination in the opposite direction.\"). Nevertheless, we will\nnot eschew use of the phrase \"present effects of past discrimination,\" as we\nused this language in Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 605, and another circuit did so in\nPodberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115\nS. Ct. 2001 (1995). We will, however, limit its application in accordance\nwith Wygant and Croson.\n\n                                      37\n\fremedial justification for its racial classifications, the district\n\ncourt must make a \"factual determination\" as to whether remedial\n\naction is necessary.      Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277-78.        We review such\n\nfactual rulings for clear error.\n\n\n\n                                     1.\n\n     The Supreme Court has \"insisted upon some showing of prior\n\ndiscrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing\n\nlimited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such\n\ndiscrimination.\"      Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274 (plurality opinion of\n\nPowell, J.) (citing Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433\n\nU.S. 299 (1977)).40      In Wygant, the Court analyzed a collective\n\nbargaining agreement between a school board and a teacher's union\n\nthat allowed the board to give minorities preferential treatment in\n\nthe event of layoffs.      A plurality rejected the theory that such a\n\nprogram was justified because it provided minority role models.\n\nId. at 274-77 (plurality opinion).          Such a claim was based upon\n\nremedying    \"societal    discrimination,\"      a   rationale    the   Court\n\nconsistently has rejected as a basis for affirmative action.\n\nAccordingly, the state's use of remedial racial classifications is\n\nlimited to the harm caused by a specific state actor.41\n\n\n      40\n         See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 286 (opinion of O'Connor, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (\"The Court is in agreement that whatever the\nformulation employed, remedying past or present racial discrimination by a\nstate actor is a sufficiently weighty state interest to warrant remedial use\nof a carefully constructed affirmative action program.\").\n     41\n        See also id. at 288 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (\"I agree with the plurality that a government agency's interest\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                     38\n\f     Moreover, the plurality in Wygant held that before a state\n\nactor properly could implement such a plan, it \"must ensure that\n\n. . . it has strong evidence that remedial action is warranted.\"\n\nId. at 277.    Accord id. at 289 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part\n\nand concurring in judgment).         The plurality felt that \"[i]n the\n\nabsence of particularized findings, a court could uphold remedies\n\nthat are ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in\n\ntheir ability to affect the future.\"         Id. at 276.\n\n     The   Croson   Court    further    discussed   how    to   identify   the\n\nrelevant past discriminator.           Writing for the Court, Justice\n\nO'Connor   struck    down   a   minority    business      set-aside   program\n\nimplemented by the City of Richmond and justified on remedial\n\ngrounds.   While the district court opined that sufficient evidence\n\nhad been found by the city to believe that such a program was\n\nnecessary to remedy the present effects of past discrimination in\n\nthe construction industry, the Court held:\n\n     Like the \"role model\" theory employed in Wygant, a\n     generalized   assertion   that   there  had   been   past\n     discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance\n     for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of\n     the injury it seeks to remedy.       It 'has no logical\n     stopping point.' Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality\n     opinion). 'Relief' for such an ill-defined wrong could\n     extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded\n     to [minority businesses] in Richmond mirrored the\n     percentage of minorities in the population as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nin remedying 'societal' discrimination, that is discrimination not traceable\nto its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass\nconstitutional muster under strict scrutiny.\").\n\n                                       39\n\f488 U.S. at 498.42             The Court refused to accept indicia of past\n\ndiscrimination        in       anything    but    \"the    Richmond     construction\n\nindustry.\"       Id. at 505.\n\n       In addition, in a passage of particular significance to the\n\ninstant       case,   the      Court   analogized   the   employment     contractor\n\nsituation to that of higher education and noted that \"[l]ike claims\n\nthat discrimination in primary and secondary schooling justifies a\n\nrigid racial preference in medical school admissions, an amorphous\n\nclaim that there has been past discrimination in a particular\n\nindustry cannot justify the use of an unyielding quota.\"                       Id. at\n\n499.        Such claims were based upon \"sheer speculation\" about how\n\nmany minorities would be in the contracting business absent past\n\ndiscrimination.          Id.\n\n       Applying the teachings of Croson and Wygant, we conclude that\n\nthe district court erred in expanding the remedial justification to\n\nreach all public education within the State of Texas.                   The Supreme\n\nCourt repeatedly has warned that the use of racial remedies must be\n\ncarefully limited, and a remedy reaching all education within a\n\nstate addresses a putative injury that is vague and amorphous.                       It\n\nhas    \"no     logical     stopping     point.\"     Wygant,      476   U.S.    at   275\n\n(plurality opinion).\n\n       The     district     court's     holding   employs   no    viable      limiting\n\nprinciple.       If a state can \"remedy\" the present effects of past\n\ndiscrimination in its primary and secondary schools, it also would\n\n\n       42\n        Justice O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices\nWhite, Stevens, and Kennedy in this portion of the opinion.\n\n                                           40\n\fbe allowed to award broad-based preferences in hiring, government\n\ncontracts, licensing, and any other state activity that in some way\n\nis affected by the educational attainment of the applicants.                  This\n\nvery argument was made in Croson and rejected:\n\n      The \"evidence\" relied upon by the dissent, history of\n      school   desegregation   in    Richmond   and    numerous\n      congressional reports, does little to define the scope of\n      any injury to minority contractors in Richmond or the\n      necessary remedy. The factors relied upon by the dissent\n      could justify a preference of any size or duration.\n\n488   U.S.    at    505.    The   defendants'     argument    here   is   equally\n\nexpansive.43\n\n      Strict scrutiny is meant to ensure that the purpose of a\n\nracial preference is remedial.          Yet when one state actor begins to\n\njustify racial preferences based upon the actions of other state\n\nagencies,     the    remedial     actor's     competence     to   determine   the\n\nexistence and scope of the harmSSand the appropriate reach of the\n\nremedySSis called into question.             The school desegregation cases,\n\nfor example, concentrate on school districtsSSsingular government\n\nunitsSSand the use of interdistrict remedies is strictly limited.\n\nSee Missouri v. Jenkins, 115 S. Ct. 2038, 2048 (1995); Milliken v.\n\nBradley, 418 U.S. 717, 745 (1974) (\"[W]ithout an interdistrict\n\nviolation and interdistrict effect, there is no constitutional\n\nwrong      calling    for   an    interdistrict    remedy.\").        Thus,    one\n\n\n\n      43\n        The fact that the plaintiffs named the State of Texas as one\ndefendant does not mean that it is proper to scrutinize the state as the\nrelevant past discriminator. This argument confuses a theory of liability\nwith a justification for a limited racial remedy. The State of Texas simply\nmay be responsible for the wrongs of the law school, which is a governmental\nentity the state has created. The Supreme Court, however, has limited the\nremedial interest to the harm wrought by a specific governmental unit.\n\n                                        41\n\fjustification for limiting the remedial powers of a state actor is\n\nthat the specific agency involved is best able to measure the harm\n\nof its past discrimination.\n\n     Here, however, the law school has no comparative advantage in\n\nmeasuring the present effects of discrimination in primary and\n\nsecondary   schools   in    Texas.      Such    a     task   becomes   even   more\n\nimprobable where, as here, benefits are conferred on students who\n\nattended out-of-state or private schools for such education.                  Such\n\nboundless \"remedies\" raise a constitutional concern beyond mere\n\ncompetence.     In this situation, an inference is raised that the\n\nprogram was the result of racial social engineering rather a desire\n\nto implement a remedy.\n\n     No one disputes that in the past, Texas state actors have\n\ndiscriminated against some minorities in public schools.                 In this\n\nsense,   some   lingering    effects    of     such    discrimination    is   not\n\n\"societal,\" if that term is meant to exclude all state action.                 But\n\nthe very program at issue here shows how remedying such past wrongs\n\nmay be expanded beyond any reasonable limits.\n\n     Even if, arguendo, the state is the proper government unit to\n\nscrutinize, the law school's admissions program would not withstand\n\nour review.     For the admissions scheme to pass constitutional\n\nmuster, the State of Texas, through its legislature, would have to\n\nfind that past segregation has present effects; it would have to\n\ndetermine the magnitude of those present effects; and it would need\n\nto limit carefully the \"plus\" given to applicants to remedy that\n\nharm.    A broad program that sweeps in all minorities with a remedy\n\n\n                                       42\n\fthat     is    in   no   way     related    to    past       harms   cannot      survive\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.           Obviously, none of those predicates has\n\nbeen satisfied here.\n\n       We further reject the proposition that the University of Texas\n\nSystem, rather than the law school, is the appropriate governmental\n\nunit for       measuring     a   constitutional       remedy.        The   law    school\n\noperates as a functionally separate unit within the system.                          As\n\nwith all law schools, it maintains its own separate admissions\n\nprogram. The law school hires faculty members that meet the unique\n\nrequirements        of   a   law   school       and    has    its    own   deans    for\n\nadministrative purposes.           Thus, for much the same reason that we\n\nrejected the educational system as the proper measureSSgenerally\n\nensuring that the legally-imposed racially discriminatory program\n\nis remedialSSwe conclude that the University of Texas System is\n\nitself        too   expansive      an   entity        to     scrutinize     for    past\n\ndiscrimination.44\n\n       44\n        And again, any such remedy here would be grossly speculative. As the\ndefendants concede and the district court found, there is no recent history of\novert sanctioned discrimination at the University of Texas. Hopwood, 861\nF. Supp. at 572. Nor does the record even suggest such discrimination at any\nof the other component schools of the University of Texas System. Thus, any\nharm caused to the students of those institutions would be the result of the\npresent effects of past discrimination.\n      We do note that the law school is not autonomous. In Texas, the\nmanagement of higher education has been divided by the legislature into\ndifferent \"systems.\" See 12 TEX. JUR. 3D, Colleges and Universities § 2 (1993).\nThe\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, with which the law school is associated, is\npart of the University of Texas System. TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 67.01 to 67.62\n(West 1991). Accordingly, the legislature, which has ultimate control over\nthe school, has delegated its \"management and control\" to the regents of the\nUniversity of Texas System. Id. § 67.02. Thus, the law school is governed by\nboth the legislature and the university's board of regents.\n      Yet, while the state's higher authorities may have the power to require\nthe law school to remedy its past wrongs, they may do so consistently with the\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                           43\n\f      In sum, for purposes of determining whether the law school's\n\nadmissions system properly can act as a remedy for the present\n\neffects of past discrimination, we must identify the law school as\n\nthe relevant alleged past discriminator.           The fact that the law\n\nschool ultimately may be subject to the directives of others, such\n\nas   the   board   of   regents,   the    university   president,    or   the\n\nlegislature, does not change the fact that the relevant putative\n\ndiscriminator in this case is still the law school.            In order for\n\nany of these entities to direct a racial preference program at the\n\nlaw school, it must be because of past wrongs at that school.\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n      Next, the relevant governmental discriminator must prove that\n\nthere are present effects of past discrimination of the type that\n\njustify the racial classifications at issue:\n\n      To have a present         effect of past discrimination\n      sufficient to justify    the program, the party seeking to\n      implement the program    must, at a minimum, prove that the\n      effect it proffers is    caused by the past discrimination\n      and that the effect is   of sufficient magnitude to justify\n      the program.\n\nPodberesky v. Kirwan, 38 F.3d 147, 153 (4th Cir. 1994), cert.\n\ndenied, 115 S. Ct. 2001 (1995).          Moreover, as part of showing that\n\nthe alleged present effects of past discrimination in fact justify\n\nthe racial preference program at issue, the law school must show\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nConstitution only if the remedial actions are directed at the law school.\nThis requirement is what the Supreme Court dictated by limiting the remedial\npurpose to the \"governmental unit involved.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274\n(plurality opinion).\n\n                                     44\n\fthat it adopted the program specifically to remedy the identified\n\npresent effects of the past discrimination.\n\n       Here,   according   to   the   district   court:      \"The   evidence\n\npresented at trial indicates those effects include the law school's\n\nlingering reputation in the minority community, particularly with\n\nprospective students, as a \"white\" school; an underrepresentation\n\nof minorities in the student body; and some perception that the law\n\nschool is a hostile environment for minorities.\"            861 F. Supp. at\n\n572.   Plaintiffs now argue that these three alleged effects are at\n\nmost examples of societal discrimination, which the Supreme Court\n\nhas found not to be a valid remedial basis.               \"The effects must\n\nthemselves be examined to see whether they were caused by the past\n\ndiscrimination and whether they are of a type that justifies the\n\nprogram.\"      Podberesky, 38 F.3d at 154.\n\n       As a legal matter, the district court erred in concluding that\n\nthe first and third effects it identifiedSSbad reputation and\n\nhostile environmentSSwere sufficient to sustain the use of race in\n\nthe admissions process.          The Fourth Circuit examined similar\n\narguments in Podberesky, a recent case that struck down the use of\n\nrace-based scholarships.        The university in that case sought, in\n\npart, to justify a separate scholarship program based solely upon\n\nrace because of the university's \"poor reputation within the\n\nAfrican-American community\" and because \"the atmosphere on campus\n\n[was] perceived as being hostile to African-American students.\"\n\nId. at 152.\n\n       The Podberesky court rejected the notion that either of these\n\n\n                                      45\n\frationales could support the single-race scholarship program. The\n\ncourt reasoned that any poor reputation by the school \"is tied\n\nsolely to knowledge of the University's discrimination before it\n\nadmitted African-American students.\"          Id. at 154.    The court found\n\nthat \"mere knowledge of historical fact is not the kind of present\n\neffect that can justify a race-exclusive remedy.                  If it were\n\notherwise, as long as there are people who have access to history\n\nbooks, there will be programs such as this.\"           Id.\n\n     We concur in the Fourth Circuit's observation that knowledge\n\nof   historical    fact   simply     cannot     justify      current    racial\n\nclassifications.   Even if, as the defendants argue, the law school\n\nmay have a bad reputation in the minority community, \"[t]he case\n\nagainst   race-based   preferences    does     not   rest    on   the   sterile\n\nassumption that American society is untouched or unaffected by the\n\ntragic oppression of its past.\"      Maryland Troopers Ass'n v. Evans,\n\n993 F.2d 1072, 1079 (4th Cir. 1993).             \"Rather, it is the very\n\nenormity of that tragedy that lends resolve to the desire to never\n\nrepeat it, and find a legal order in which distinctions based on\n\nrace shall have no place.\"     Id.      Moreover, we note that the law\n\nschool's argument is even weaker than that of the university in\n\nPodberesky, as there is no dispute that the law school has never\n\nhad an admissions policy that excluded Mexican Americans on the\n\nbasis of race.\n\n     The Podberesky court rejected the hostile-environment claims\n\nby observing that the \"effects\"SSthat is, racial tensionsSSwere the\n\nresult of present societal discrimination.           38 F.3d at 155.      There\n\n\n                                   46\n\fwas simply no showing of action by the university that contributed\n\nto any racial tension. Similarly, one cannot conclude that the law\n\nschool's   past   discrimination   has   created   any   current   hostile\n\nenvironment for minorities.    While the school once did practice de\n\njure discrimination in denying admission to blacks, the Court in\n\nSweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), struck down the law\n\nschool's program. Any other discrimination by the law school ended\n\nin the 1960's.    Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 555.\n\n     By the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first\n\nprogram designed to recruit minorities, id. at 557, and it now\n\nengages in an extensive minority recruiting program that includes\n\na significant amount of scholarship money.         The vast majority of\n\nthe faculty, staff, and students at the law school had absolutely\n\nnothing to do with any discrimination that the law school practiced\n\nin the past.\n\n     In such a case, one cannot conclude that a hostile environment\n\nis the present effect of past discrimination.        Any racial tension\n\nat the law school is most certainly the result of present societal\n\ndiscrimination and, if anything, is contributed to, rather than\n\nalleviated by, the overt and prevalent consideration of race in\n\nadmissions.\n\n     Even if the law school's alleged current lingering reputation\n\nin the minority communitySSand the perception that the school is a\n\nhostile environment for minoritiesSSwere considered to be the\n\npresent effects of past discrimination, rather than the result of\n\nsocietal discrimination, they could not constitute compelling state\n\n\n                                   47\n\finterests     justifying   the    use        of   racial   classifications   in\n\nadmissions.     A bad reputation within the minority community is\n\nalleviated not by the consideration of race in admissions, but by\n\nschool action designed directly to enhance its reputation in that\n\ncommunity.\n\n     Minority students who are aided by the law school's racial\n\npreferences have already made the decision to apply, despite the\n\nreputation. And, while prior knowledge that they will get a \"plus\"\n\nmight make potential minorities more likely to apply, such an\n\ninducement does nothing, per se, to change any hostile environment.\n\nAs we have noted, racial preferences, if anything, can compound the\n\nproblem of a hostile environment.45\n\n     The law school wisely concentrates only on the second effect\n\nthe district court identified:          underrepresentation of minorities\n\nbecause of past discrimination.              The law school argues that we\n\nshould consider the prior discrimination by the State of Texas and\n\nits educational system rather than of the law school.               The school\n\ncontends that this prior discrimination by the state had a direct\n\neffect on the educational attainment of the pool of minority\n\napplicants and that the discriminatory admissions program was\n\nimplemented partially to discharge the school's duty of eliminating\n\nthe vestiges of past segregation.\n\n     As we have noted, the district court accepted the law school's\n\n\n\n      45\n         The testimony of several minority students underscores this point.\nThey stated generally that they felt that other students did not respect them\nbecause the other students assumed that minorities attained admission because\nof the racial preference program.\n\n                                        48\n\fargument that past discrimination on the part of the Texas school\n\nsystem (including primary and secondary schools), reaching back\n\nperhaps as far as the education of the parents of today's students,\n\njustifies the current use of racial classifications.46                No one\n\ndisputes that Texas has a history of racial discrimination in\n\neducation.     We have already discussed, however, that the Croson\n\nCourt unequivocally restricted the proper scope of the remedial\n\ninterest to the state actor that had previously discriminated. 488\n\nU.S. at 499.    The district court squarely found that \"[i]n recent\n\nhistory, there is no evidence of overt officially sanctioned\n\ndiscrimination at the University of Texas.\"          861 F. Supp. at 572.\n\nAs a result, past discrimination in education, other than at the\n\nlaw school, cannot justify the present consideration of race in law\n\nschool admissions.\n\n     The law school now attempts to circumvent this result by\n\nclaiming that its racial preference program is really a \"State of\n\n\n     46\n        The argument is that because the state discriminated in its primary\nand secondary school systems, the students' educational attainment was\nadversely affected, and this harm extended to their higher education, thus\njustifying giving current applicants a \"plus\" based on race. This reasoning\nis especially important in justifying benefits for Mexican Americans, as there\nis no evidence that the law school implemented de jure (or even de facto)\ndiscrimination against this group in its admissions process. Because this\nlogic ignores the relevant actions in this case, i.e., discrimination by the\nlaw school, it is not necessary for us to examine the potential causational\nflaws in the argument.\n      Moreover, if we did find that the past wrongs of Texas school districts\nwere the sort of discrimination that the law school could address, the school\nstill would have to prove the present effects of that past wrong. Without\nsome strong evidence in the record showing that today's law school applicants\nstill bear the mark of those past systems, such effects seem grossly\nspeculative. The district court simply assumed that \"[t]his segregation has\nhandicapped the educational achievement of many minorities. . . .\" 861 F.\nSupp. at 573. And we would still have to ask whether the program was narrowly\ntailored to this goal.\n\n\n                                     49\n\fTexas\" plan rather than a law school program.                   Under the law\n\nschool's reading of the facts, its program was the direct result of\n\nthe state's negotiations with what was then the United States\n\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare's Office for Civil\n\nRights (\"OCR\").    To bring the Texas public higher education system\n\ninto compliance with title VI, the state adopted the so-called\n\n\"Texas Plan.\"\n\n     In   light    of    our   preceding    discussion     on   the   relevant\n\ngovernmental unit, this argument is inapposite.             Even if the law\n\nschool were specifically ordered to adopt a racial preference\n\nprogram, its implementation at the law school would have to meet\n\nthe requirements of strict scrutiny.47\n\n     Moreover, these alleged actions in the 1980's are largely\n\nirrelevant for purposes of this appeal.            There is no indication\n\nthat the Texas Plan imposed a direct obligation upon the law\n\nschool.   To the contrary, the law school's admissions program was\n\nself-initiated.         Moreover, the current admissions program was\n\nformulated primarily in the 1990's, and the district court did not\n\nhold otherwise.    See 861 F. Supp. at 557 (\"Against this historical\n\nbackdrop [including Texas's dealing with the OCR], the law school's\n\ncommitment    to   affirmative     action    in   the    admissions    process\n\nevolved.\").     Thus it is no more correct to say that the State of\n\n      47\n         To the extent that the OCR has required actions that conflict with\nthe Constitution, the directives cannot stand. The Supreme Court has\naddressed required state compliance with federal law in the voting rights\ncontext. Miller v. Johnson, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 2491 (1995) (\"As we suggested in\nShaw[v. Reno, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 2830-31 (1993)], compliance with federal\nantidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based districting where the\nchallenged district was not reasonably necessary under a constitutional\nreading and application of those laws.\") (emphasis added).\n\n                                     50\n\fTexas implemented the program at issue than it is to assert that\n\nthe Commonwealth       of    Virginia,     not   the   City   of     Richmond,    was\n\nresponsible for the minority set-aside program in Croson.\n\n     The      district      court   also      sought   to     find     a   remedial\n\njustification for the use of race and, at the same time, attempted\n\nto distinguish Croson using United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717\n\n(1992).      The court held that the law school had a compelling\n\ninterest to \"desegregate\" the school through affirmative action.\n\n     The reliance upon Fordice is misplaced, however. The district\n\ncourt held that Fordice's mandate to schools \"to eliminate every\n\nvestige of racial segregation and discrimination\" made Croson\n\ninapplicable, 861 F. Supp. at 571, and reasoned that this mandate\n\nincludes the effects of such prior practices or policies.\n\n     Fordice does not overrule Croson.                 The central holding of\n\nFordice is that a state or one of its subdivisions must act to\n\nrepudiate the continuing \"policies or practices\" of discrimination.\n\n505 U.S. at 731-32.48        In other words, a state has an affirmative\n\nduty to remove policies, tied to the past, by which it continues to\n\ndiscriminate.       The Fordice Court did not address, in any way, a\n\nstate     actor's   duty    to   counter      the   present   effects      of    past\n\n\n\n     48\n          In more detail, the Fordice Court said the following:\n\n     If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its\n     prior system that continue to have segregative effects))whether by\n     influencing student enrollment or by fostering segregation in\n     other facets of the university system))and such policies are\n     without sound educational justification and can be practicably\n     eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that\n     it has dismantled its prior system.\n505 U.S. at 731.\n\n                                         51\n\fdiscrimination that it did not cause.49\n\n     In sum, the law school has failed to show a compelling state\n\ninterest in remedying the present effects of past discrimination\n\nsufficient to maintain the use of race in its admissions system.\n\nAccordingly, it is unnecessary for us to examine the district\n\ncourt's determination that the law school's admissions program was\n\nnot narrowly tailored to meet the compelling interests that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously perceived.50\n\n\n      49\n         In Croson, Justice O'Connor did argue that a state may act to prevent\nits powers from being used to support private discrimination. 488 U.S. at\n491-92 (plurality opinion) (\"[A] state or local subdivision, (if delegated the\nauthority from the State) has the authority to eradicate the effects of\nprivate discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction.\") (emphasis\nadded). Hence, a specific state actor can act to prevent the state from being\nused as a \"passive participant\" in private discrimination. This power does\nnot create wide-ranging authority to remedy societal discrimination, however.\n     50\n        The plaintiffs argue that indeed there is no narrow tailoring, for at\nleast the following reasons: (1) In 1992, more than two-thirds of all\nadmission offers to blacks, and a majority of all blacks who matriculated,\ninvolved out-of-state residents, thus undercutting the law school's stated\npurpose of remedying past discrimination in Texas. (2) The system of\npreferences has no termination date, thus indicating that there is no\nconnection between the plan and a bona fide remedial purpose. (3) Preference\nis given even to blacks and Mexican Americans who graduated from private\nsecondary schools and thus did not suffer from state-ordered racial\ndiscrimination.\n      The law school apparently chose admission goals of 5% blacks and 10%\nMexican Americans because those are the respective percentages of college\ngraduates in Texas who are black and Mexican American. Nothing in the record,\nhowever, establishes any probative correlation between the degree of past\ndiscrimination and the percentage of students from a minority group who\ngraduate from college.\n\n      There is no history either of de jure discrimination against Mexican\nAmericans in education at any level in Texas or of de facto discrimination\nagainst Mexican Americans by the law school. Therefore, it is puzzling that\nthe law school would set an admissions goal for Mexican Americans that is\ntwice that of blacks, as to whom the history of de jure discrimination in\nTexas Education in general, and by the law school in particular, is\nirrefutable.\n      If fashioning a remedy for past discrimination is the goal, one would\nintuit that the minority group that has experienced the most discrimination\nwould have the lowest college graduation rate and therefore would be entitled\nto the most benefit from the designed remedy. The goals established by the\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                     52\n\f                                     IV.\n\n     While the district court declared the admissions program\n\nunconstitutional, it granted the plaintiffs only limited relief.\n\nThey had requested injunctive relief ordering that they be admitted\n\nto law school, compensatory and punitive damages, and prospective\n\ninjunctive relief preventing the school from using race as a factor\n\nin admissions.\n\n\n\n                                     A.\n\n     We must decide who bears the burden of proof on the damages\n\nissue.     The   district   court   refused   to   order   the   plaintiffs'\n\nadmission (or award any compensatory damages), as it found that\n\nthey had not met their burden of persuasion in attempting to show\n\nthat they would have been admitted absent the unconstitutional\n\nsystem.   861 F. Supp. at 579-82.51        The law school now argues that\n\nthe plaintiffs had the burden of persuasion on the issue of damages\n\nand that the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.52\n\nThe plaintiffs maintain, as they did in the district court, that\n\nonce they had shown a constitutional violation, the burden of\n\n\n(...continued)\nlaw school are precisely the reverse of that intuitive expectation and are\nmore reflective of a goal of diversity (which we hold is not compelling) than\nof a goal of remedying past discrimination.\n     51\n        This finding also affected the court's analysis in denying\nprospective relief and compensatory damages.\n      52\n         The district court applied a burden-shifting scheme similar to the\nmethodology used in the title VII context. 861 F. Supp. at 579-80 (citing St.\nMary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502 (1993)). The law school concedes\nthat the burden-shifting exercise was unnecessary, but it maintains\nnonetheless that the \"ultimate burden of proof,\" including proof of damages,\nrests upon the plaintiffs. See id.\n\n                                     53\n\fpersuasion shifted to the school to show that the denial of\n\nadmission was not caused by that violation.\n\n     The well-established rule is that in order to collect money\n\ndamages, plaintiffs must prove that they have been injured.               Carey\n\nv. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 254-57 (1978).             Several Supreme Court\n\ncases, however, allow for a transfer of burden upon proof of\n\ndiscrimination.     See Mt. Healthy City Sch., Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 284 (1977); City of Arlington Heights v.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977).53\n\n     In   Mt.   Healthy,    a    discharged   school    teacher    sued    for\n\nreinstatement, claiming his termination was a result of comments he\n\nhad made on a radio show, a violation of his First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights.      The Court devised a test of \"causation\" that\n\nplaced the burden of proving no harm on the defendant:\n\n     Initially, . . . the burden was properly placed upon the\n     respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally\n     protected, and that this conduct was a \"substantial\n     factor\"))or to put it in other words, that it was a\n     \"motivating factor\" in the Board's decision not to rehire\n     him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the\n     District Court should have gone on to determine whether\n     the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence\n     that it would have reached the same decision as to the\n     respondent's reemployment even in the absence of the\n     protected conduct.\n\n429 U.S. at 287.    In Arlington Heights, the Court applied a similar\n\nrule where the decision of a zoning board was challenged as\n\nracially discriminatory.        See 429 U.S. at 270 n.21.     In sum, these\n\ncases allow a defendant, who intended to discriminate or otherwise\n\n     53\n        Some of Justice Powell's dicta in Bakke also squarely supports the\nplaintiffs' claim that once discrimination is proved, the defendant bears the\nburden of proving no damage. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n\n                                     54\n\fact unconstitutionally, to show that its action would have occurred\n\nregardless of that intent.\n\n     Courts are split on whether the Mt. Healthy rubric applies in\n\nracial preference cases.54         We conclude that the Mt. Healthy\n\nmethodology is appropriate in the instant case.            The Mt. Healthy\n\nplaintiff, like the present plaintiffs, brought a constitutional\n\nchallenge, and his injuries were analogous to the injuries alleged\n\nhere.   As we have said, the title VII burden-shifting scheme is\n\ndesigned to determine whether a violation of law has occurred.\n\n     In this case, there is no question that a constitutional\n\nviolation has occurred (as the district court found) and that the\n\nplaintiffs were harmed thereby.           See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2105\n\n(\"The injury in cases of this kind is that a 'discriminatory\n\nclassification prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal\n\nfooting.'\") (citation omitted).           The Mt. Healthy burden-shifting\n\nexercise simply gives the defendant law school a second chance of\n\nprevailing by showing that the violation was largely harmless.\n\n     As the district court held, to the contrary, that plaintiffs\n\nhad the burden, it should revisit this issue in light of what we\n\nhave said in both the liability and remedial portions of this\n\n\n      54\n         Compare Henson v.

Mich. 1980) (adopting Bakke and\nMt. Healthy reasoning in toto for firefighter's reverse discrimination claims)\nand United States v. McDonald, 553 F. Supp. 1003, 1006 (S.D. Tex. 1983)\n(dictum) (same for discriminatory criminal prosecution).\n\n                                     55\n\fopinion.55   In the event that the law school is unable to show (by\n\na preponderance of the evidence) that a respective plaintiff would\n\nnot have been admitted to the law school under a constitutional\n\nadmissions system, the court is to award to that plaintiff any\n\nequitable and/or monetary relief it deems appropriate.\n\n     Obviously, if the school proves that a plaintiff would not\n\nhave gained admittance to the law school under a race-blind system,\n\nthat plaintiff would not be entitled to an injunction admitting him\n\nto the school.     On the other hand, the law school's inability to\n\nestablish    a    plaintiff's     non-admissionSSif      that    occurs    on\n\nremandSSopens a panoply of potential relief, depending in part upon\n\nwhat course that plaintiff's career has taken since trial in mid-\n\n1994.    It then would be up to the district court, in its able\n\ndiscretion, to decide whether money damages56 can substitute for an\n\norder of immediate admission SSrelief that would ring hollow for a\n\nplaintiff for whom an education at the law school now is of little\n\nor no benefit.57\n\n      55\n         The district court concluded that the plaintiffs proved only that\nthey had been denied equal treatment but had failed to \"prove an injury-in-\nfact.\" 861 F. Supp. at 582. To the extent that the court felt that\nplaintiffs failed to show injury-in-fact because they failed to prove that\nthey would have been admitted under a constitutional admissions system, this\nconclusion should be revisited on remand, where the district court must apply\nthe proper burden and redetermine whether plaintiffs would have been admitted.\n      56\n         We do not opine on any Eleventh Amendment immunity in this case.\nSee, e.g., United Carolina Bank v. Board of Regents, 665 F.2d 553, 561 (5th\nCir. Unit A 1982) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred a civil rights\nsuit brought by a professor against university officials in their official\ncapacities). This issue is simply not before us.\n      57\n         For example, if the school is unable to show that plaintiff Carvell\nwould not have gained admission even under a constitutional admissions system,\nhe may be entitled to be compensated for the difference, to which he\ntestified, between tuition at the law school and tuition at Southern Methodist\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                     56\n\f       Additionally, the district court erred in holding that\n\nplaintiffs did not prove that defendants had committed intentional\n\ndiscrimination under title VI.         \"Intentional discrimination,\" as\n\nused in this context, means that a plaintiff must prove \"that the\n\ngovernmental    actor,   in   adopting    or   employing    the   challenged\n\npractices or undertaking the challenged action, intended to treat\n\nsimilarly situated persons differently on the basis of race.\"\n\nCastaneda v. Pickard, 648 F.2d 989, 1000 (5th Cir. Unit A June\n\n1981); see also Franklin v. Gwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60\n\n(1992);    Guardians Ass'n v. Civil Serv. Comm'n, 463 U.S. 582\n\n(1983).    While we agree with the district court's conclusion that\n\nthe various defendants acted in good faith, there is no question\n\nthat they intended to treat the plaintiffs differently on account\n\nof their race.\n\n\n\n                                     B.\n\n     The    plaintiffs      argue    that,     because     they   proved    a\n\nconstitutional violation, and further violations were likely to\n\nresult, the district court erred in denying them prospective\n\ninjunctive relief.     We review denials of this sort of relief for an\n\nabuse of discretion.       See, e.g., Peaches Entertainment Corp. v.\n\n\n(...continued)\nUniversity School of Law, which he attended instead. The district court\nshould also consider the following paradox: The law school argued strenuously\nthat plaintiff Elliott did not have standing to sue, as he had been offered\nadmission to the schoolSSalbeit at the last momentSSand had failed to accept\nthat offer. The district court found that this offer of admission had not\nbeen communicated to Elliott. 861 F. Supp. at 566. In considering damages,\nhowever, the court held that \"in all likelihood, the plaintiffs would not have\nbeen offered admission even under a constitutionally permissible process.\"\nId. at 581. The district court should re-examine these contradictory results.\n\n                                     57\n\fEntertainment Repertoire, 62 F.3d 690, 693 (5th Cir. 1995).                  The\n\nlaw school avers that the district court was well within its\n\nequitable discretion in denying relief, especially as the school\n\nhad abandoned the practices that the district court had found were\n\nunconstitutionalSSto-wit, the use of separate admissions committees\n\nfor whites and minorities.\n\n      We review denials of prospective injunctive relief as we would\n\nany other denial of permanent injunctive relief under FED. R. CIV.\n\nP.   65,   keeping       in   mind,   however,   the   questions   of   mootness,\n\nripeness, and standing.           See generally 11A CHARLES A. WRIGHT     ET AL.,\n\nFEDERAL PRACTICE   AND    PROCEDURE § 2942 (2d ed. 1995).          That treatise\n\nnotes that\n\n      [p]erhaps the most significant single component in the\n      judicial decision whether to exercise equity jurisdiction\n      and grant permanent injunctive relief is the court's\n      discretion. Of course, in some situations the facts and\n      relevant law may indicate that an injunction clearly\n      should be granted or denied. However, in most cases the\n      determination whether to issue an injunction involves a\n      balancing of interests of the parties who might be\n      affected by the court's decision))the hardship on the\n      plaintiff if relief is denied as compared to the\n      defendant if relief is granted and the extent to which\n      the latter hardship can be mitigated by requiring a\n      security bond. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court's\n      decision depends on the circumstances of each case.\n\nId. at 41-42.      Accordingly, the usual practice upon reversal of a\n\ndenial of injunctive relief is to remand for a reweighing of the\n\nequities.    Id. § 2962, at 448;         See, e.g., James v. Stockham Valves\n\n& Fittings Co., 559 F.2d 310, 354-55 (5th Cir. 1977).                   In other\n\nsituations, the appellate court may order the district court to\n\nenter an injunction.           See, e.g., Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.\n\nCity of Mobile, 457 F.2d 340 (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n                                          58\n\f     According to the district court, the school had abandoned the\n\nadmissions      procedureSSconsisting        of    the   separate    minority\n\nsubcommitteeSSthat was used in 1992, 1993, and 1994.                The court\n\nreasoned that, as a new procedure was developed for 1995, a\n\nprospective injunction against the school was inappropriate.               We\n\nconclude, however, that, while the district court may have been\n\ncorrect    in    deciding   that    the    new    procedure   eliminates   the\n\nconstitutional flaws that the district court identified in the 1992\n\nsystem, there is no indication that the new system will cure the\n\nadditional constitutional defects we now have explained.\n\n     The new system utilizes a small \"administrative admissions\n\ngroup\" and does not use presumptive admission and denial scores.\n\nSee Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 582 n.87.            Most significantly, there\n\nis no indication that in employing the new plan, the law school\n\nwill cease to consider race per se in making its admissions\n\ndecisions.      To the contrary, as the district court recognized, the\n\nlaw school continues to assert that overt racial preferences are\n\nnecessary to the attainment of its goals. See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp.\n\nat 573-75.\n\n     The district court has already granted some equitable relief:\n\nIt directed that the plaintiffs be permitted to re-apply to the law\n\nschool    without    incurring     further    administrative     costs.     In\n\naccordance with this opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to apply\n\nunder a system of admissions that will not discriminate against\n\nanyone on the basis of race.        Moreover, the plaintiffs have shown\n\nthat it is likely that the law school will continue to take race\n\n\n                                      59\n\finto account in admissions unless it receives further judicial\n\ninstruction to the effect that it may not do so for the purpose of\n\n(1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering the school's\n\nreputation in the community; (3) combating the school's perceived\n\nhostile environment toward minorities; or (4) remedying the present\n\neffects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school.\n\n      It is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time\n\nthat the law school be enjoined, as we are confident that the\n\nconscientious       administration      at     the       school,    as    well   as   its\n\nattorneys, will heed the directives contained in this opinion.                         If\n\nan injunction should be needed in the future, the district court,\n\nin   its   discretion,      can     consider       its    parameters      without     our\n\nassistance.       Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal to\n\nenter an injunction.\n\n\n\n                                         C.\n\n      The plaintiffs contend that the district court's application\n\nof the wrong standard causes it to deny punitive damages.                             The\n\nplaintiffs aver that the court applied an animus standard, when it\n\nshould     have    asked    whether    the     school       acted     with   \"reckless\n\nindifference\" to their constitutional rights.                         They ask for a\n\nremand on this issue.\n\n      It   is     not   apparent,    from    the     record,       what   standard    the\n\ndistrict court applied in considering the punitive damages issue.\n\nThe court did determine, however, that the law school had always\n\nacted in good faith.        This is a difficult area of the law, in which\n\n\n                                         60\n\fthe law school erred with the best of intentions.   As a result, the\n\nplaintiffs have not met the federal standard for punitive damages\n\nas stated in Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983).   Thus, we agree\n\nwith the district court that punitive damages are not warranted.\n\nWe note, however, that if the law school continues to operate a\n\ndisguised or overt racial classification system in the future, its\n\nactors could be subject to actual and punitive damages.\n\n\n\n                                V.\n\n     Consolidated with the appeal of the merits issues of this\n\nappeal is No. 94-50569, challenging the district court's denial of\n\na motion to intervene.     The proposed intervenorsSSthe Thurgood\n\nMarshall Legal Society and the Black Pre-Law Association (the\n\n\"associations\")SSask this court, for the second time, for the right\n\nto intervene.   On their first attempt, the associations moved to\n\nintervene prior to trial either as of right or by permission.   The\n\ndistrict court denied intervention, and we affirmed.    See Hopwood\n\nv. Texas, 21 F.3d 603 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (\"Hopwood I\").\n\n     Now, following the trial, the associations believe they can\n\nshow that the law school has failed to assert one of their proposed\n\ndefenses, a circumstance they contend establishes their right to\n\nintervene.   We apply the law of the case doctrine and dismiss No.\n\n94-50569 for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n     The proposed intervenors are black student organizations at\n\n\n                                61\n\fthe University of Texas at Austin and its law school that, just\n\nprior to the trial of the merits appeal, sought to intervene,\n\narguing that the law school would not effectively protect their\n\ninterests in continuing racial preferences at the law school.                        The\n\ndistrict court denied the proposed intervention on the ground that\n\nthe law school and the two associations had the same objective:\n\npreservation of the status quo.\n\n      On expedited appeal, this court affirmed on the ground that\n\nthe associations had failed to show that the law school had an\n\ninterest different from theirs.                 We also commented that the two\n\ngroups had failed to show \"a separate defense of the affirmative\n\naction plan that the State has failed to assert.\"                    Id. at 606.     The\n\npanel   implicitly        considered     and      rejected,     as    one       potential\n\ndivergence of interests, the possibility that the law school would\n\nnot raise a defense based upon the legality of the use of TI scores\n\nunder title VI, as the associations argued that possibility as one\n\nbasis for intervention.\n\n      After    their      first   motion    to     intervene        was   denied,    the\n\nassociations remained involved in the case.                 Throughout the course\n\nof the trial, they acted as amici curiae.                   And, at the close of\n\ntrial but before judgment, the district court intimated that it\n\nwould      allow   them     to    submit        information     for       the    record.\n\nAccordingly, the associations sought to introduce testimonial and\n\ndocumentary evidence supporting their arguments that (1) the TI by\n\nitself was an unlawful basis for admissions decisions under title\n\nVI   and    (2)    that    affirmative      action     at     the    university      was\n\n\n                                           62\n\fconstitutionally required. The plaintiffs opposed the introduction\n\nof evidence on these \"new defenses,\" and the district court agreed.\n\nThe associations were allowed to submit amicus briefs and highlight\n\nevidence that was already in the record but were not allowed to\n\nraise new issues or supplement the record.\n\n     Shortly thereafter, the associations again sought to intervene\n\nunder FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a)(2) (intervention as of right),          claiming\n\nthat the law school had failed to raise their two \"new defenses\"\n\nand, accordingly, that events now showed that that representation\n\ninadequately protected their interests.         They sought to reopen the\n\nrecord to introduce evidence supporting these arguments.\n\n     The district court summarily refused this request. That order\n\nis the focus of this separate appeal, in which the associations\n\npresent only the title VI defense and ask to be allowed to present\n\nsuch evidence only if we do not affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                    B.\n\n     There is no caselaw in this circuit that directly addresses\n\nhow to review successive motions to intervene.58 The parties direct\n\nus to Hodgson v. United Mine Workers, 473 F.2d 118, 125-26 (D.C.\n\n\n\n     58\n        There is circuit law regarding successive motions, but the pertinent\nopinions do not examine the standard of review explicitly. See, e.g.,\nKneeland v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 806 F.2d 1285 (5th Cir.)\n(implicit application of de novo review without discussion of standard), cert.\ndenied, 484 U.S. 817 (1987); United States v. Louisiana, 669 F.2d 314, 315\n(5th Cir. 1982) (application of abuse of discretion review for timeliness\ndetermination on second motion where proposed intervenor failed to argue for\nfirst motion after remand); Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Environs Dev. Corp., 601\nF.2d 851, 857 (5th Cir. 1979) (implicit application of de novo review where\ndistrict court treated second motion as both a reconsideration of prior motion\nand a new motion).\n\n                                     63\n\fCir. 1972); United States Envt'l Protection Agency v. City of Green\n\nForest, 921 F.2d 1394, 1401 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S.\n\n956 (1991); and Meek v. Metropolitan Dade County, 985 F.2d 1471,\n\n1477 (11th Cir. 1993).      These courts, which were examining whether\n\nthe appeal from a successive motion was timely as per the appellate\n\nrequirements, devised the general rule that a second motion would\n\nbe treated as independent of the first if it was reached under\n\nmaterially changed circumstances.\n\n     Here, the associations assume that their second intervention\n\nmotion is separate and distinct from their earlier failed attempt,\n\nbecause the law school's failure to raise their proposed defense\n\nconstitutes a changed circumstance.59 Thus, they ask that we engage\n\nin de novo review of their motion.\n\n     The plaintiffs, however, note that this motion was entitled a\n\n\"renewed motion for intervention.\"         The plaintiffs argue that the\n\ndistrict court was reconsidering its previous denial order under\n\n\n     59\n        The associations ground this argument in language taken from the\nprior appeal. One necessary element for intervention is a showing that the\npresent parties will inadequately represent the proposed intervenors'\ninterests. While the associations lost on this ground on the last appeal,\nthey now claim that the opinion supports the argument that the law school's\ndefense is inadequate. In the last appeal, we cited Jansen v. City of\nCincinnati, 904\nF.2d 336 (6th Cir. 1990), as support for the following statement: \"Nor have\nthe proposed intervenors shown that they have a separate defense of the\naffirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert.\" Hopwood I, 21\nF.3d at 606. Because the law school, now after trial, still has not asserted\nthe associations' title VI defense, the associations maintain that they now\ncan meet their burden.\n      In Jansen, however, the court found that the proposed intervenors had an\ninterest different from that of the defendant city. 904 F.2d at 343. This\nwas the basis for that court's holding that the city's representation was\ninadequate. See id. (\"Proffering this alleged violation of the consent decree\nas an affirmative defense is directly counter to the City's interest.\")\n(emphasis added). Here, we have already found that the law school's and the\nassociations' interests are the same. Jansen therefore does not support\nintervention.\n\n                                     64\n\fits FED. R. CIV. P. 60(b) powers, and we should review merely for\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                      C.\n\n     While the \"changed circumstances\" test may have meritSSan\n\nissue we do not decide todaySSwe do not find it applicable to this\n\ncase.     Instead, the \"law of the case\" doctrine militates against\n\nreconsideration of this motion.            Normally, when a prior panel\n\ndiscusses an issue on the merits, a later panel cannot reach a\n\ncontrary conclusion under the preclusive principle of law of the\n\ncase.   See Williams v. City of New Orleans, 763 F.2d 667, 669 (5th\n\nCir. 1985).       There is no question that the Hopwood I             panel\n\naddressed the intervention as a matter of right de novo, on the\n\nmerits, including the potential that the law school would not raise\n\nevery defense proposed by the associations.\n\n     The question of whether we can rely upon the law of the case\n\ndoctrine, however, is clouded because of the \"anomalous\" rule that\n\nexists in this circuit concerning the procedural posture of these\n\nintervention cases.       Under that rule, we have only provisional\n\njurisdiction to review a district court's denial of a motion to\n\nintervene.\n\n     If    we   agree   with   the   district   court,   our   jurisdiction\n\n\"evaporates.\"     Hence, the denial of leave to intervene when the\n\nparty had a right to intervene is immediately appealable.                On\n\nappeal, however, our rule \"requires a merit review of any claim of\n\nintervention in order for [us] to determine whether or not the\n\n\n                                      65\n\fdistrict court's order is appealable.\"            Weiser v. White, 505 F.2d\n\n912, 916 (5th Cir. 1975).       If the claim is without merit, then the\n\norder \"is not appealable, the appellate court has no jurisdiction,\n\nand the appeal should be dismissed.\"        Id.    Thus, despite the merits\n\nreview, this is a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.60\n\n      Our anomalous rule complicates the analysis of the preclusive\n\neffects of the prior panel decision, because dismissals for lack of\n\njurisdiction normally do not have preclusive effect.              See, e.g.,\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 41(b).     Accordingly, while appellate courts review\n\ndenials of intervention motions on the merits, it is uncertain to\n\nwhat extent such a review has preclusive effect.            Nonetheless, we\n\nrecognize the possibility of issue preclusion on the question of\n\njurisdiction itself.\n\n      While a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not operate as\n\nan adjudication on the merits, \"[t]his provision means only that\n\nthe dismissal permits a second action on the same claim that\n\ncorrects the deficiency found in the first action.              The judgment\n\nremains effective to preclude relitigation of the precise issue of\n\njurisdiction or venue that led to the initial dismissal.\"            7C WRIGHT\n\n\n\n      60\n        At least one set of commentators has eschewed this traditional rule.\nTheir position is that \"[a]ny denial of intervention should be regarded as an\nappealable final order.\" 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, § 1923, at 508. Under this\nproposed rule, the federal court would \"affirm denial of intervention when\npreviously, having determined on the merits that the trial court was right, it\nwould dismiss the appeal.\" Id. at 509. We have acknowledged that this would\nbe the better rule. See Korioth v. Briscoe, 523 F.2d 1271, 1279 n.26 (5th\nCir. 1975) (citing WRIGHT ET AL., supra). In fact, the Hopwood I panel affirmed\nrather than dismissing for want of jurisdiction. Under the suggested rule,\nbecause we would have a final order on the merits from a previous panel on\nthis issue, this case would probably be at an end. Nonetheless, as the\nanomalous rule constitutes our circuit caselaw, we are bound to follow it.\n\n\n                                      66\n\fET AL.,    supra, § 4436, at 338.61     Thus, a party is precluded from\n\nsuccessively appealing the same intervention motion.\n\n      Here, the record shows that the associations raised this same\n\ntitle VI argument before the Hopwood I panel in both their brief\n\nand at oral argument.      That panel, reviewing de novo the merits of\n\nthe associations' claims, denied intervention.             Accordingly, the\n\nlast panel implicitly addressed this issue, and we must respect its\n\ndecision to deny intervention.             The law of the case doctrine\n\nprevents merits review, and we dismiss No. 94-50569 for want of\n\njurisdiction.62\n\n\n\n                                     VI.\n\n      In summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law\n\n\n      61\n        A dismissal for want of jurisdiction, however, leaves open the\npossibility that the deficiency can be cured. If that occurs, no issue\npreclusion\nexists. See 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, § 4436, at 338. It is at this point in the\nanalysis that \"changed circumstances\" may become relevant. Arguably, the\n\"changed circumstances\" analysis, in effect, \"cures\" the earlier\njurisdictional deficiency. Thus, if the circumstances of the case change to\nsuch an extent that jurisdiction would lie, the subsequent motion to intervene\nshould not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In effect, the posture of\nthe case has changed, as it would any time a given jurisdictional problem is\ncured.\n      62\n         In Hopwood I, we decided that (1) the interests of the associations\nwere adequately represented by the law school and the state, and (2) as a\npractical matter, disposition in the principal suit would not impair or impede\neither of those groups' interests. 21 F.3d at 605. The law of the case\ndoctrine militates against revisiting that decision here.\n      For purposes of any future litigation, however, we note a necessary\neffect of our previous holding when coupled with the law school's failure to\nraise a title VI argument: Neither the district court's decision nor ours in\nthis appeal is binding on the associations as res judicata, law of the case,\ncollateral estoppel, or any other theoretical bar.\n      In short, as the title VI issue has not been litigated, the associations\nare not precluded from instituting a separate and independent title VI\nchallenge to the law school's use of the TI. We neither express nor imply an\nopinion on the viability of such a challenge.\n\n                                      67\n\fmay not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit\n\nin order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived\n\neffects of a hostile environment at the law school, to alleviate\n\nthe law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to\n\neliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors\n\nother than the law school.            Because the law school has proffered\n\nthese justifications          for   its    use   of    race   in   admissions,     the\n\nplaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing that they were\n\nscrutinized under an unconstitutional admissions system.                           The\n\nplaintiffs are entitled to reapply under an admissions system that\n\ninvokes none of these serious constitutional infirmities.                    We also\n\ndirect the district court to reconsider the question of damages,\n\nand we conclude that the proposed intervenors properly were denied\n\nintervention.\n\n       In    No.   94-50569,    the    appeal     is    DISMISSED     for   want   of\n\njurisdiction.

The\n\nlaw school        offers alternative justifications for its race-based\n\nadmissions process, each of which, it insists, is a compelling\n\ninterest: (1) remedying the present effects of past discrimination\n\n(present effects) and (2) providing the educational benefits that\n\ncan be obtained only when the student body is diverse (diversity).64\n\n        As   to   present   effects,   I   concur   in   the   panel   opinion’s\n\nanalysis: Irrespective of whether the law school or the University\n\nof Texas system as a whole is deemed the relevant governmental unit\n\n\n\nto be tested,65 neither has established the existence of present\n\neffects of past discrimination sufficient to justify the use of a\n\nracial classification.66          As to diversity, however, I respectfully\n\ndisagree with the panel opinion’s conclusion that diversity can\n\nnever be a compelling governmental interest in a public graduate\n\nschool.      Rather than attempt to decide that issue, I would            take a\n\nconsiderably narrower path —           and, I believe, a more appropriate\n\none — to reach an equally narrow result: I would assume arguendo\n\nthat diversity can be a compelling interest but conclude that the\n\nadmissions process here under scrutiny was not narrowly tailored to\n\n  64\n       See Hopwood v.

EQUAL PROTECTION\n\n           The Equal Protection Clause provides that \"[n]o State shall .\n\n. . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection\n\nof the laws.\"67         Accordingly, \"all racial classifications, imposed\n\nby whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be\n\nanalyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\"68                  Racial\n\nclassifications will survive strict scrutiny \"only if they are\n\nnarrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental\n\ninterests.\"69          Thus, strict scrutiny comprises two inquiries of\n\nequal valence:          the \"compelling interest\" inquiry and the \"narrow\n\ntailoring\" inquiry.70              Moreover, these inquiries are conjunctive:\n\nTo avoid constitutional nullity, a racial classification must\n\nsatisfy both inquiries.              Failure to satisfy either is fatal.\n\n\n\nB.         RACIAL CLASSIFICATION\n\n\n     67\n          U.S. Const., amend. 14, § 1.\n     68\n     Adarand Constructors Inc. v.

Depending on an applicant's\n\nrace, his request for admission was considered under one of three\n\ndifferent          (and,      as   explained    in    the   panel   opinion,    often\n\ndispositive71) TI admission ranges:                  one for blacks only, a    second\n\nfor Mexican Americans only, and a third for all other races and\n\nnationalities, including non-Mexican Hispanic Americans. In short,\n\neach applicant for admission to the law school was classified by\n\nrace, and his application was treated differently                      according into\n\nwhich of those three               racial classifications it fell.         Thus, the\n\nlaw          school's      1992    admissions        process,   like     all   racial\n\nclassifications by the government, is subject to strict scrutiny.72\n\n\n\n\nC.          STRICT SCRUTINY\n\n            The law school contends that it employs a racially stratified\n\nadmissions process to obtain, inter alia, the educational benefits\n\nof a diverse student body.                Translated into the constitutional\n\nidiom, the law school insists that achieving student body diversity\n\nin a public graduate school is a compelling governmental interest.\n\nThe law school invokes the opinion of Justice Powell in Regents of\n\n\n\n\n      71\n      See Panel . Opn. at 6-7 (explaining that a Mexican American or a black\napplicant with a TI of 189 is presumptively admitted, while an \"other race\"\napplicant with an identical TI is presumptively denied).\n     72\n           Adarand, 115 S.Ct. at 2115.\n\n                                               71\n\fthe University of California v. Bakke73 to support that postulate.\n\nThe panel opinion rejects that support, concluding that from its\n\ninception Bakke had little precedential value and now, post-\n\nAdarand, has none.       My fellow panelists thus declare categorically\n\nthat \"any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for\n\nthe    purposes    of   achieving    a   diverse    student   body   is   not   a\n\ncompelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"74\n\n        This conclusion may well be a defensible extension of recent\n\nSupreme Court precedent, an extension which in time may prove to be\n\nthe Court's position. It admittedly has a simplifying appeal as an\n\neasily applied, bright-line rule proscribing any use of race as a\n\ndeterminant.      Be that as it may, this position remains an extension\n\nof the law--one that, in my opinion, is both overly broad and\n\nunnecessary to the disposition of this case. I am therefore unable\n\nto concur in the majority's analysis.\n\n        My decision not to embrace the ratio decidendi of the majority\n\nopinion results from three premises:               First, if Bakke is to be\n\ndeclared dead, the Supreme Court, not a three-judge panel of a\n\ncircuit court, should make that pronouncement.                Second, Justice\n\nO'Connor expressly states that Adarand is not the death knell of\n\naffirmative action — to which I would add, especially not                 in the\n\n\n\n   73\n      438 U.S. 265 (1978).    Justice Powell opens his discussion of equal\nprotection and diversity in Bakke by stating that the \"attainment of a diverse\nstudent body . . . clearly [is] a constitutionally permissible goal for an\ninstitution of higher education,\" id. at 311-12, and, in the unique context of\ninstitutions of higher learning, he concludes that diversity is a compelling\ninterest.

IS DIVERSITY A COMPELLING INTEREST?\n\n           Along its path to a per se ban on any consideration of race in\n\nattempting to achieve student body diversity, the panel opinion\n\nholds (or strongly implies) that remedying vestigial effects of\n\npast discrimination is the only compelling interest that can ever\n\njustify racial classification.77            The main reason that I cannot go\n\nalong with the panel opinion to that extent is that I do not read\n\nthe applicable Supreme Court precedent as having held squarely and\n\nunequivocally either that remedying effects of past discrimination\n\nis the only compelling state interest that can ever justify racial\n\nclassification, or conversely that achieving diversity in the\n\n  75\n     Adarand, 115 S.Ct. at 2117 (\"When race-based action is necessary to further\na compelling interest, such action is within the constitutional constraints if\nit satisfies the 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous\ncases.\").\n          76\n        See, e.g, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 224 (1991)(O'Connor, J,\ndissenting)(\"It is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint . . . that this Court\nwill not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding\nthem.\")(citing Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold\nEngineering, P.C., 467 U.S. 138, 157 (1984)).\n     77\n          Panel Opn. at 26-29.\n\n                                          73\n\fstudent body of a public graduate or professional school can never\n\nbe a compelling governmental interest.           Indeed, the panel opinion\n\nitself hedges a bit on whether the Supreme Court's square holdings\n\nhave    gone   that   far,78   particularly     in   the   realm    of   higher\n\neducation.79\n\n        Between the difficulty inherent in applying Bakke80 and the\n\n\n\n\n   78\n       The Court appears to have decided that \"there is essentially only one\ncompelling state interest to justify racial classification:     remedying past\nwrongs.\" Panel opn. at 27 (citing City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n469, 493 (1989)(plurality opinion)(emphasis added)).\n   79\n      Panel Opn. at 28 n.27, (quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S.\n267, 286 (1986) (O'Connor, J. concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n (“[A]lthough its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in the\npromotion of racial diversity has been found to be sufficiently `compelling’ at\nleast in the context of higher education to support the use of racial\nconsiderations in furthering that interest.”).\n  80\n     I readily concede that problems are encountered when efforts are made to\napply the Supreme Court's Bakke decision.       Panel Opn. at 20, 25, & 26\n(respectively pointing out that (1) Bakke     comprises multiple opinions and\ndivergent analyses, (2) no Justice, other than Justice Powell, discusses\ndiversity, and (3) Bakke is questioned in Adarand). The panel opinion fails to\ndescribe this last problem with precise accuracy. That opinion's expurgated\nversion of the quotation at 26, lines 736-42 makes it appear as though the\nAdarand majority questioned Bakke. In full, the sentence reads \"[the Court's]\nfailure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left\nunresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.\"\nThus, although the Court acknowledges that Bakke et al. left things unresolved,\nI do not read this quotation, (as the panel opinion suggests) as an order to\nthrow out Bakke--bath water, baby, and all.\n      Nevertheless, the fractured nature of Bakke's holding has left more\nquestions than answers in its wake. As observed in the instant panel opinion,\nthere has been \"no [other] indication from the Supreme Court, . . . [whether] the\nstate's interest in diversity [in higher education] constitutes a compelling\njustification for governmental race-based classifications.\"    Panel Opn. at 28.\nI agree that Bakke is the only indication that diversity is a compelling\ninterest. But, unlike the panel opinion, which jettisons Justice Powell's Bakke\nopinion because of its singularity, I find that singularity to be precisely the\nfactor that makes Justice Powell's opinion the most pertinent Supreme Court\nstatement on this issue. Therefore, when and if the Supreme Court addresses\nthis case or its analog, the Court will have no choice but to go with, over,\naround, or through Justice Powell's Bakke opinion. By assuming, as I do, that\ndiversity is a compelling interest, however, these problems are avoided\naltogether.\n\n                                       74\n\fminimal guidance in Adarand,81 the definition and application of the\n\ncompelling interest inquiry seems to be suspended somewhere in the\n\ninterstices    of   constitutional      interpretation.        Until    further\n\nclarification issues from        the Supreme Court defining \"compelling\n\ninterest\" (or telling us how to know one when we see one), I\n\nperceive no \"compelling\" reason to rush in where the Supreme Court\n\nfears — or at least declines — to tread.                   Instead, I would\n\npretermit any attempt at a compelling interest inquiry and accept\n\nJustice O'Connor's invitation to apply the Court's more discernible\n\nand less intrusive \"narrow tailoring\" precedent.82              Thus, for the\n\npurpose of this appeal I assume, without deciding, that diversity\n\nis a compelling interest,83 and proceed to the narrowly tailored\n\n       81\n      Recently, in Adarand the Supreme Court stated that it had \"altered the\n[equal protection] playing field in some important respects.\" 115 S.Ct. at 2118.\nIn her opinion for the majority, however, Justice O'Connor repeatedly emphasizes\nthat Adarand did not drive a stake through the heart of affirmative action. To\nthe contrary, she emphatically states, \"we wish to dispel the notion that strict\nscrutiny is 'strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'\"        Id. at 2117 (quoting\nFullilove, 448 U.S. 448, 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). Moreover,\n\"[w]hen race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such\naction is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies the 'narrow\ntailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases.\" Id.\n\n      It seems to me that as a practical matter, Adarand resolves very little.\nIn fact, the much heralded change is quite limited: Race-based classifications,\nimposed by the federal government, are now subject to strict scrutiny. Curiously\n(or perhaps not so curiously given the enigmatic difficulty of the task), the\nSupreme Court declined to define compelling interest or to tell us how to apply\nthat term. Indeed, the Court did not even decide the case before it, opting\ninstead to remand the case for further adjudication.\n        82\n       Id.  (\"[W]hen race-based action is necessary to further a compelling\ninterest, such action is within the constitutional constraints if it satisfies\nthe 'narrow tailoring' test this Court has set out in previous cases.\").\n  83\n    Although I assume without deciding that diversity is a compelling interest,\nif I had no choice but to address compelling interest I would do so in the\ncontext in which the issue is presented, i.e., the constitutionally permissible\nmeans of constructing an entering a class at a public graduate or professional\nschool. This unique context, first identified by Justice Powell, differs from\nthe employment context, differs from the minority business set aside context, and\ndiffers from the re-districting context; it comprises only the public higher\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                       75\n\finquiry.\n\n\n\nF.         TEST FOR NARROW TAILORING\n\n           When strictly scrutinizing a racial classification for narrow\n\ntailoring, the first question is \"What is the purpose of this\n\nracial classification?\"84              The present effects rationale having\n\nproven feckless in this case, today’s answer to that first question\n\nis a given: The law school's purpose is diversity.                Accordingly, I\n\nperceive the next question to be, \"Was the law school's 1992\n\nadmissions process, with one TI range for blacks, another for\n\nMexican Americans, and a third for other races, narrowly tailored\n\nto achieve diversity?\"           I conclude that it was not.       Focusing as it\n\ndoes on blacks and Mexican Americans only, the law school's 1992\n\nadmissions process misconceived the concept of diversity, as did\n\nCalifornia's         in   the   view   of   Justice   Powell:    Diversity   which\n\nfurthers a compelling state interest \"encompasses a far broader\n\n\n\n(...continued)\neducation context and implicates the uneasy marriage of the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments.   See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12.    Consequently, we play with fire\nwhen we assume an easy crossover of Fourteenth Amendment maxims pronounced in\ncases decided in such other contexts.\n\n      The panel opinion concludes that this contextual distinction is\nunimportant, holding that, whatever the context, remedying the past effects of\ndiscrimination is the only compelling interest that can justify a racial\nclassification. Panel Opn. at 26-29. That opinion acknowledges, however, that\nSupreme Court precedent does not go this far: namely, the higher education\ncontext is different. Indeed the panel opinion quotes Justice O'Connor's words\nexpressly stating that higher education is different. Panel Opn. at 28 n.27\n(quoting Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 286 (1986) (\"[A]lthough\nits precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial\ndiversity has been found to be sufficiently 'compelling' at least in the context\nof higher education to support the use of racial considerations in furthering\nthat interest.\")).\n     84\n          United States v.

Yet blacks and\n\nMexican Americans are but two among any number of racial or ethnic\n\ngroups that could and presumably should contribute to genuine\n\ndiversity.     By singling out only those two ethnic groups,                 the\n\ninitial stage of the law school's 1992 admissions process ignored\n\naltogether non-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and\n\nNative Americans, to name but a few.\n\n      In this light, the limited racial effects of the law school's\n\npreferential admissions process, targeting exclusively blacks and\n\n\n  85\n     Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316. In the portion of his opinion that addresses narrow\ntailoring, Justice Powell concluded that California's admission process\nmisconceived the concept of \"diversity.\" Id. California's preferential program,\nfocused as it was solely on aiding black applicants, was not necessary to attain\ndiversity. Id.\n    86\n       In the instant litigation, the law school created its own Catch-22 by\nadvancing two putative compelling interests that ultimately proved to produce so\nmuch internal tension as to damage if not fatally wound each other. Under the\nbanner of prior discrimination, Texas had no choice but to single out blacks and\nMexican-Americans, for those two racial groups were the only ones of which there\nis any evidence whatsoever of de facto or de jure racial discrimination by the\nState of Texas in the history of its educational system. But, by favoring just\nthose two groups and doing so with a virtual quota system for affirmative action\nin admissions, the law school estops itself from proving that its plan to achieve\ndiversity is ingenuous, much less narrowly tailored.\n\n                                       77\n\fMexican Americans, more closely resembles a set aside or quota\n\nsystem for those two disadvantaged minorities than it does an\n\nacademic admissions program narrowly tailored to achieve true\n\ndiversity. I concede that the law school's 1992 admissions process\n\nwould increase the percentages of black faces and brown faces in\n\nthat year’s entering class.                     But facial diversity is not true\n\ndiversity, and a system thus conceived and implemented simply is\n\nnot narrowly tailored to achieve diversity.\n\n           Accordingly,        I would find that the law school's race-based\n\n1992 admissions process was not narrowly tailored to achieve\n\ndiversity and hold it constitutionally invalid on that basis.                        By\n\nso        doing    I   would   avoid    the     largely   uncharted   waters   of    a\n\ncompelling interest analysis. Although I join my colleagues of the\n\npanel in their holding that the law school's 1992 admissions\n\nprocess           fails   to   pass    strict    scrutiny,87   on   the   question   of\n\ndiversity I follow the solitary path of narrow tailoring rather\n\nthan the primrose path of compelling interest to reach our common\n\nholding.\n\n\n\n                                                II\n\n                                           REMEDY\n\n           Before concluding, I am compelled to add a few words about the\n\npanel opinion’s “commentary” regarding the remedy to be imposed by\n\nthe district court on remand.                        Without employing the express\n\n\n     87\n      I also concur in my colleagues' conclusion that intervention by the two\nblack student organizations is not mandated, and do so for the same reasons.\n\n                                                78\n\flanguage of injunction or affixing that label to its holding, the\n\npanel opinion’s discussion of the remedy on remand is              “strongly\n\nsuggestive”      and   has    all   of   the   substantive   earmarks   of   an\n\ninjunction:\n\n        [The] plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the\n        law school will continue to take race into account in\n        admissions   unless   it  receives   further   judicial\n        instruction to the effect that it may not do so for the\n        purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2)\n        altering the school's reputation in the community; (3)\n        combating the school's perceived hostile environment\n        toward minorities; or (4) remedying the present effects\n        of past discrimination by actors other than the law\n        school.\n             It is not necessary, however, for us to order at\n        this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are\n        confident that the conscientious administration at the\n        school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the\n        directives contained in this opinion. If an injunction\n        should be needed in the future, the district court, in\n        its discretion, can consider its parameters without our\n        assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact that court's\n        refusal to enter an injunction.88\n\nEssentially, the substance of             the quoted portion of the panel\n\nopinion constitutes a de facto injunction — telling the district\n\ncourt precisely what to tell the law school that it can and can't\n\ndo — albeit without the use of the word injunction.               To me,     if\n\n“it” has feathers, swims, waddles, and quacks like a duck, it is a\n\nduck; and I find such an “un-injunction” inappropriate. If instead\n\nwe were simply to reverse and remand on the violation issue, we\n\nwould stop short of finding de novo that the law school had\n\nviolated these four plaintiffs’ equal protection rights.            It seems\n\nunavoidable to me that until the district court determines that\n\nthere has been a violation, a              remedy cannot be fashioned and\n\n  88\n       Panel Opn. at 59-60.\n\n                                         79\n\fshould not be the subject of appellate speculation.89\n\n            The district court denied the plaintiffs injunctive relief,\n\nbut only after assigning the burden of proof to the wrong party.90\n\n  No member of this panel questions that, in the initial stanza of\n\nthe burden-shifting minuet of            Mt. Healthy Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Doyle,91 the plaintiffs met their burden.                   Once the plaintiffs\n\ndid that, the burden should have shifted to the law school.\n\nInstead, the          district   court   left    it    with    the   plaintiffs      and\n\nconcluded that they had failed to carry the ultimate burden.                         The\n\ndistrict court’s failure to shift the burden to the law school, and\n\nthe         conclusion   of   that   court     which    followed,         were   errors.\n\nAccordingly, like my colleagues of the panel, I would remand the\n\ncase to         the   district   court   with    instructions        to    relieve   the\n\nplaintiffs of the misplaced burden while affording the law school\n\nthe opportunity to prove that the prima facie violation established\n\nby the plaintiffs was essentially harmless.                   But it seems clear to\n\nme that this is where our analysis should end.                       As a result, I\n\ndepart from the “commentary” in the panel opinion regarding the\n\nprecise elements of the remedy to be fashioned by the district\n\ncourt if it should conclude on remand that the law school shall\n\n\n\n   89\n      Hay v.

This is not a class\n\naction;      nothing    is   before    us     here   save   the    claims   of   four\n\nindividual plaintiffs.            These four individual plaintiffs properly\n\nchallenge only the admissions process employed by the law school in\n\n1992 — not the admissions process that was in place and employed in\n\n1995, not the admissions process that is being employed in 1996,\n\nand not the admissions process to be applied in any future years.\n\nIn sum, I would remand, and in the process I                 would take care not\n\nto eviscerate the discretion of the district court with excessive\n\n“commentary” or implicit directions on the precise nature of the\n\nremedy that must ensue.            Rather, my remand would simply instruct\n\nthe district court to apply the correct burden-shifting process\n\narticulated in Mt. Healthy, then see how the law school deals with\n\nit.   That way,    if    the Mt. Healthy application should demonstrate\n\nthe need for a remedy, the district court would be free to fashion\n\nthe appropriate reliefSQincluding injunctive if necessarySQfor those\n\namong the individual plaintiffs whose individual cases warrant it.\n\nFor   this    court    to    do    anything      beyond   that    impresses   me   as\n\noverreaching.      Thus I concur in the judgment of the panel opinion\n\nbut, as to its conclusion on the issue of strict scrutiny and its\n\n\n                                            81\n\fgloss on the order of remand, I disagree for the reasons I have\n\nstated and therefore concur specially.\n\n\n\n\n                               82\n\f",

SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n\n\n\n\n     With the best of intentions, in order to increase the en-\n\nrollment of certain favored classes of minority students, the\n\nUniversity of Texas School of Law (\"the law school\") discrimi-\n\nnates in favor of those applicants by giving substantial racial\n\npreferences in its admissions program.   The beneficiaries of this\n\n\n                                 2\n\fsystem are blacks and Mexican Americans, to the detriment of\n\nwhites and non-preferred minorities.       The question we decide to-\n\nday in No. 94-50664 is whether the Fourteenth Amendment permits\n\nthe school to discriminate in this way.\n\n     We hold that it does not.        The law school has presented no\n\ncompelling justification, under the Fourteenth Amendment or Su-\n\npreme Court precedent, that allows it to continue to elevate some\n\nraces over others, even for the wholesome purpose of correcting\n\nperceived racial imbalance in the student body.       \"Racial prefer-\n\nences appear to 'even the score' . . . only if one embraces the\n\nproposition that our society is appropriately viewed as divided\n\ninto races, making it right that an injustice rendered in the\n\npast to a black man should be compensated for by discriminating\n\nagainst a white.\"     City of Richmond v.

In No. 94-50664, we reverse and remand, concluding\n\nthat the law school may not use race as a factor in law school\n\nadmissions.     Further, we instruct the court to reconsider the\n\nissue of damages in accordance with the legal standards we now\n\nexplain.   In No. 94-50569, regarding the denial of intervention\n\nby two black student groups, we dismiss the appeal for want of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f                                     I.\n\n                                     A.\n\n     The University of Texas School of Law is one of the nation's\n\nleading law schools, consistently ranking in the top twenty.\n\nSee, e.g., America's Best Graduate Schools, U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT\n\nMar. 20, 1995, at 84 (national survey ranking of seventeenth).\n\nAccordingly, admission to the law school is fiercely competitive,\n\nwith over 4,000 applicants a year competing to be among the ap-\n\nproximately 900 offered admission to achieve an entering class of\n\nabout 500 students.       Many of these applicants have some of the\n\nhighest grades and test scores in the country.\n\n     Numbers are therefore paramount for admission.            In the early\n\n1990's, the law school largely based its initial admissions deci-\n\nsions upon an applicant's so-called Texas Index (\"TI\") number, a\n\ncomposite of undergraduate grade point average (\"GPA\") and Law\n\nSchool Aptitude Test (\"LSAT\") score.1          The law school used this\n\nnumber as a matter of administrative convenience in order to rank\n\ncandidates and to predict, roughly, one's probability of success\n\nin law school.     Moreover, the law school relied heavily upon such\n\nnumbers to estimate the number of offers of admission it needed\n\nto make in order to fill its first-year class.\n\n\n     1\n        The formulae were written by the Law School Data Assembly Service\naccording to a prediction derived from the success of first-year students in\npreceding years. As the LSAT was determined to be a better predictor of\nsuccess in law school, the formulae for the class entering in 1992 accorded an\napproximate 60% weight to LSAT scores and 40% to GPA.\n\n      The formula for students with a three-digit LSAT, see infra note 5, was\ncalculated as: LSAT + (10)(GPA) = TI. For students with a two-digit LSAT,\nthe formula was: (1.25)LSAT + (10)GPA = TI.\n\n                                      4\n\f     Of course, the law school did not rely upon numbers alone.\n\nThe admissions office necessarily exercised judgment in inter-\n\npreting the individual scores of applicants, taking into consid-\n\neration factors such as the strength of a student's undergraduate\n\neducation, the difficulty of his major, and significant trends in\n\nhis own grades and the undergraduate grades at his respective\n\ncollege (such as grade inflation).               Admissions personnel also\n\nconsidered what qualities each applicant might bring to his law\n\nschool class.       Thus, the law school could consider an applicant's\n\nbackground, life experiences, and outlook.                    Not surprisingly,\n\nthese hard-to-quantify factors were especially significant for\n\nmarginal candidates.2\n\n     Because of the large number of applicants and potential ad-\n\nmissions    factors,    the   TI's     administrative        usefulness       was   its\n\nability to sort candidates.            For the class entering in 1992SSthe\n\nadmissions group at issue in this caseSSthe law school placed the\n\ntypical applicant in one of three categories according to his TI\n\nscores:    \"presumptive      admit,\"      \"presumptive    deny,\"   or     a    middle\n\n\"discretionary zone.\"         An applicant's TI category determined how\n\nextensive a review his application would receive.\n\n     Most,    but    not   all,     applicants   in    the    presumptive       admit\n\ncategory     received      offers    of    admission     with    little       review.\n\n\n     2\n        Notably, but of less significance to this appeal, residency also had a\nstrong, if not often determinant, effect. Under Texas law in 1992, the law\nschool was limited to a class of 15% non-residents, and the Board of Regents\nrequired an entering class of at least 500 students. The law school therefore\nhad to monitor offers to non-residents carefully, in order not to exceed this\nquota, while at the same time maintaining an entering class of a manageable\nsize.\n\n                                          5\n\fProfessor    Stanley      Johanson,    the   Chairman   of   the    Admissions\n\nCommittee,    or   Dean    Laquita    Hamilton,   the   Assistant    Dean    for\n\nAdmissions, reviewed these files and downgraded only five to ten\n\npercent to the discretionary zone because of weaknesses in their\n\napplications, generally a non-competitive major or a weak under-\n\ngraduate education.\n\n      Applicants in the presumptive denial category also received\n\nlittle consideration.       Similarly, these files would be reviewed by\n\none or two professors, who could upgrade them if they believed that\n\nthe TI score did not adequately reflect potential to compete at the\n\nlaw school.    Otherwise, the applicant was rejected.\n\n      Applications in the middle range were subjected to the most\n\nextensive scrutiny.         For all applicants other than blacks and\n\nMexican Americans, the files were bundled into stacks of thirty,\n\nwhich were given to admissions subcommittees consisting of three\n\nmembers of the full admissions committee.                Each subcommittee\n\nmember, in reviewing the thirty files, could cast a number of\n\nvotesSStypically from nine to eleven3SSamong the thirty files.\n\nSubject to the chairman's veto, if a candidate received two or\n\nthree votes, he received an offer; if he garnered one vote, he was\n\nput on the waiting list; those with no votes were denied admission.\n\n      Blacks and Mexican Americans were treated differently from\n\nother candidates, however.            First, compared to whites and non-\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The number of votes would change over the course of the admissions\nseason in order to achieve the appropriate number of offers.\n\n                                        6\n\fpreferred minorities,4 the TI ranges that were used to place them\n\ninto the three admissions categories were lowered to allow the law\n\nschool to consider and admit more of them.             In March 1992, for\n\nexample, the presumptive TI admission score for resident whites and\n\nnon-preferred minorities was 199.5         Mexican Americans and blacks\n\nneeded a TI of only 189 to be presumptively admitted.6                    The\n\ndifference in the presumptive-deny ranges is even more striking.\n\nThe presumptive denial score for \"nonminorities\" was 192; the same\n\nscore for blacks and Mexican Americans was 179.\n\n     While these cold numbers may speak little to those unfamiliar\n\n\n      4\n        As blacks and Mexican Americans were the only two minority categories\ngranted preferential treatment in admissions, it is inaccurate to say that the\nlaw school conducted separate admissions programs for \"minorities\" and \"non-\nminorities.\" While the law school application form segregated racial and\nethnic classification into seven categoriesSS\"Black/African American,\" \"Native\nAmerican,\" \"Asian American,\" \"Mexican American,\" \"Other Hispanic\" (meaning\nnon-Mexican descent), \"White,\" and \"Other (describe)\"SSonly American blacks\nand Mexican Americans received the benefit of the separate admissions track.\n      Thus, for example, the law school decided that a black citizen of Nige-\nria would not get preferential treatment, but a resident alien from Mexico,\nwho resided in Texas, would. Likewise, Asians, American Indians, Americans\nfrom El Salvador and Cuba, and many others did not receive a preference.\n      It is important to keep the composition of these categories in mind.\nFor the sake of simplicity and readability, however, we sometimes will refer\nto two broad categories: \"whites\" (meaning Texas residents who were whites\nand non-preferred minorities) and \"minorities\" (meaning Mexican Americans and\nblack Americans).\n     5\n        Because of a recent change in the grading scale of the LSAT, the law\nschool in 1992 had applicants who had taken an earlier LSAT scored on a 10-to-\n48 scale and others who had taken a later one scored on a 120-to-180 scale.\nEquivalence calculations were used to compare scores received on the two\nscales. For example, TI numbers of 199 (three-digit LSAT) and 87 (two-digit\nLSAT) were equivalent. For the sake of simplicity, we use three-digit numbers\nthroughout this opinion.\n     6\n        In March 1992, the resident Mexican American and black presumptive\nadmit lines were in parity, but they had not started that way. The initial\npresumptive admit TI's were 196 for Mexican Americans and 192 for blacks.\nThus, initially, blacks received preferential treatment over Mexican Americans\nby having a lower hurdle to cross to get into the discretionary zone. In\nMarch, Professor Johanson lowered the Mexican American TI in order to admit\nmore of this group.\n\n                                      7\n\fwith the pool of applicants, the results demonstrate that the\n\ndifference in the two ranges was dramatic.                   According to the law\n\nschool, 1992 resident white applicants had a mean GPA of 3.53 and\n\nan LSAT of 164.        Mexican Americans scored 3.27 and 158; blacks\n\nscored 3.25 and 157.       The category of \"other minority\" achieved a\n\n3.56 and 160.7\n\n\n\n     These     disparate   standards          greatly    affected      a   candidate's\n\nchance of admission.         For example, by March 1992, because the\n\npresumptive denial score for whites was a TI of 192 or lower, and\n\nthe presumptive admit TI for minorities was 189 or higher, a\n\nminority candidate with a TI of 189 or above almost certainly would\n\n\n     7\n         The median scores of the 1992 class are as follows:\n\n\nEthnicity                      Resident                 Nonresident\n\n                               GPA/LSAT                 GPA/LSAT\n\nAll students                   3.52/162                 3.61/164\nWhite                          3.56/164                 3.72/166\nBlack                          3.30/158                 3.30/156\nMexican American               3.24/157                 3.38/174*\nOther minority                 3.58/160                 3.77/157\n*Only two matriculated applicants.\n\n\n     In 1992, the LSAT's national distribution was approximately as follows:\n     LSAT                Percentile                     2-Digit LSAT\n     166                    94%                            43\n     164                    91%                            41\n     162                    88%                            40\n     160                    83%                            39\n     158                    78%                            38\n     156                    71%                            36\n\n\nOn the basis of these percentiles, one-half of the law school's white resident\nmatriculants were in the top 9% of all test-takers, one-half of the resident\nMexican Americans were in approximately the top 25% of test-takers, and one-\nhalf of the resident blacks were in the top 22% of test-takers.\n\n                                          8\n\fbe admitted, even though his score was considerably below8 the\n\nlevel     at   which     a   white    candidate         almost   certainly   would     be\n\nrejected.      Out of the pool of resident applicants who fell within\n\nthis range (189-192 inclusive), 100% of blacks and 90% of Mexican\n\nAmericans, but only 6% of whites, were offered admission.9\n\n     The stated purpose of this lowering of standards was to meet\n\nan \"aspiration\" of admitting a class consisting of 10% Mexican\n\nAmericans and 5% blacks, proportions roughly comparable to the\n\npercentages of those races graduating from Texas colleges. The law\n\nschool found meeting these \"goals\" difficult, however, because of\n\nuncertain      acceptance         rates    and    the    variable      quality   of   the\n\napplicant      pool.10       In    1992,    for    example,      the   entering   class\n\ncontained 41 blacks and 55 Mexican Americans, respectively 8% and\n\n10.7% of the class.\n\n     In addition to maintaining separate presumptive TI levels for\n\nminorities and whites, the law school ran a segregated application\n\n\n\n      8\n        To illustrate this difference, we consider the four plaintiffs in this\ncaseSSCheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David Rogers. For\na student similarly situated to Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8, to avoid presump-\ntive denial as a white, i.e., to obtain a TI of 193 or above, her LSAT had to\nbe at least a 155, a score in approximately the top 32% of test-takers. If\nshe were black (thus, needing a 180 TI), she would have had to score a 142 on\nthe LSAT, ranking her only in the top 80%. Likewise, a student similar to\nCarvell, who had a 3.28 GPA, would have needed a \"white\" LSAT of 160 (top 17%)\nand a \"black\" 147 (top 63%). A student like Rodgers with a 3.13 would have\nneeded either a 162 (top 12%) as a white or 149 as a black (top 56%). Fi-\nnally, a student like Elliott with a 2.98 GPA would have needed a 163 (top\n10%) or 150 (top 53%), respectively.\n     9\n        According to the plaintiffs, 600-700 higher-scoring white residents\nwere passed over before the first blacks were denied admission. There is no\nspecific finding on this assertion, and though the law school does not appear\nto refute it, we do not rely upon it in making our decision.\n     10\n        Thus, the law school constantly had to adjust its TI range over the\ncourse of the admissions season to reach a desired mix. See supra note 6.\n\n                                             9\n\fevaluation process. Upon receiving an application form, the school\n\ncolor-coded it according to race.                If a candidate failed to\n\ndesignate his race, he was presumed to be in a nonpreferential\n\ncategory.    Thus, race was always an overt part of the review of any\n\napplicant's file.\n\n      The   law    school   reviewed    minority     candidates    within    the\n\napplicable discretionary range differently from whites. Instead of\n\nbeing evaluated and compared by one of the various discretionary\n\nzone subcommittees, black and Mexican American applicants' files\n\nwere reviewed by a minority subcommittee of three, which would meet\n\nand   discuss     every   minority    candidate.       Thus,    each   of   these\n\ncandidates' files could get extensive review and discussion.                  And\n\nwhile the minority subcommittee reported summaries of files to the\n\nadmissions    committee     as   a   whole,    the   minority   subcommittee's\n\ndecisions were \"virtually final.\"\n\n      Finally, the law school maintained segregated waiting lists,\n\ndividing applicants by race and residence.               Thus, even many of\n\nthose minority applicants who were not admitted could be set aside\n\nin \"minority-only\" waiting lists.             Such separate lists apparently\n\nhelped the law school maintain a pool of potentially acceptable,\n\nbut marginal, minority candidates.11\n\n\n\n                                       B.\n\n\n      11\n        The district court did not find, nor is the record clear on, how\nthese different classes of waiting list candidates were compared in the event\nthe law school made last-minute admissions decisions. The record does show\nthat the school carefully monitored the race of applicants in filling the last\nopenings in late spring and early summer.\n\n                                       10\n\f     Cheryl Hopwood, Douglas Carvell, Kenneth Elliott, and David\n\nRogers     (the   \"plaintiffs\")   applied   for   admission   to   the   1992\n\nentering law school class.        All four were white residents of Texas\n\nand were rejected.\n\n     The plaintiffs were considered as discretionary zone candi-\n\ndates.12    Hopwood, with a GPA of 3.8 and an LSAT of 39 (equivalent\n\nto a three-digit LSAT of 160), had a TI of 199, a score barely\n\nwithin the presumptive-admit category for resident whites, which\n\nwas 199 and up.       She was dropped into the discretionary zone for\n\nresident whites (193 to 198), however, because Johanson decided her\n\neducational       background   overstated   the   strength    of   her   GPA.\n\nCarvell, Elliott, and Rogers had TI's of 197, at the top end of\n\nthat discretionary zone.          Their applications were reviewed by\n\nadmissions subcommittees, and each received one or no vote.\n\n\n\n                                     II.\n\n     The plaintiffs sued primarily under the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment; they also claimed derivative\n\nstatutory violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 and of title VI\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (\"title VI\").13\n\nThe plaintiffs' central claim is that they were subjected to\n\n\n     12\n        The district court discussed in detail the plaintiffs' qualifications\nand their rejections. See 861 F. Supp. at 564-67.\n      13\n         The defendants are the State of Texas; the University of Texas Board\nof Regents; the members of the board, named but sued in their official capaci-\nties; the University of Texas at Austin; the President of the university, sued\nin his official capacity; the University of Texas School of Law; the dean of\nthe law school, sued in his official capacity; and the Chairman of the Admis-\nsions Committee, sued in his official capacity.\n\n                                      11\n\funconstitutional   racial    discrimination   by   the    law   school's\n\nevaluation of their admissions applications.       They sought injunc-\n\ntive and declaratory relief and compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n     After a bench trial, the district court held that the school\n\nhad violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. 861 F. Supp.\n\nat 579.   The plaintiffs' victory was pyrrhic at best, however, as\n\nthe court refused to enjoin the law school from using race in\n\nadmissions decisions or to grant damages beyond a one-dollar\n\nnominal award to each plaintiff.    The district court, however, did\n\ngrant declaratory relief and ordered that the plaintiffs be allowed\n\nto apply again without paying the requisite fee.         Id. at 583.\n\n     The district court began by recognizing the proper constitu-\n\ntional standard under which to evaluate the admissions program:\n\nstrict scrutiny.   Id. at 568.   As it was undisputed that the school\n\nhad treated applicants disparately based upon the color of their\n\nskin, the court asked whether the law school process (1) served a\n\ncompelling government interest and (2) was narrowly tailored to the\n\nachievement of that goal.     Under the first prong of the test, the\n\ncourt held that two of the law school's five proffered reasons met\n\nconstitutional muster:      (1) \"obtaining the educational benefits\n\nthat flow from a racially and ethnically diverse student body\" and\n\n(2) \"the objective of overcoming past effects of discrimination.\"\n\nId. at 571.\n\n     Significantly, on the second justification, the court rejected\n\nthe plaintiffs' argument that the analysis of past discrimination\n\nshould be limited to that of the law school; instead, the court\n\n\n                                  12\n\fheld that the State of Texas's \"institutions of higher education\n\nare inextricably linked to the primary and secondary schools in the\n\nsystem.\"    Id.14   Accordingly, the court found that Texas's long\n\nhistory of racially discriminatory practices in its primary and\n\nsecondary schools in its not-too-distant past had the following\n\npresent effects at UT law: \"the law school's lingering reputation\n\nin the minority community, particularly with prospective students,\n\nas a 'white' school; an underrepresentation of minorities in the\n\nstudent body; and some perception that the law school is a hostile\n\nenvironment for minorities.\"         Id. at 572.     The court also noted\n\nthat \"were the Court to limit its review to the University of\n\nTexas, the Court would still find a 'strong evidentiary basis for\n\nconcluding that remedial action is necessary.'\"                 Id. (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n      The   court   next   evaluated    whether   the   Texas    program   was\n\nnarrowly tailored to further these goals.          Id. at 573.     Applying a\n\nfour-factor test devised by the Supreme Court, the court held only\n\npart of the 1992 admissions scheme unconstitutional.              Those parts\n\nthat gave minorities a \"plus,\" that is, the component of the\n\nadmissions program that treated candidates' TI scores differently\n\nbased upon race, was upheld.        Id. at 578.\n\n      The court held, however, that differential treatment was not\n\nallowed where candidates of different races were not compared at\n\n\n\n      14\n         Because of this conclusion, the district court examined at length the\nhistory of race relations in Texas and discrimination in its schools. 861\nF. Supp. at 554-57.\n\n\n                                       13\n\fsome point in the admission process.         Thus, the court struck down\n\nthe school's use of separate admissions committees for applications\n\nin the discretionary zone, id. at 578-79, and in dictum speculated\n\nthat presumptive denial lines would not pass muster, as many white\n\ncandidates would get no review, while similarly situated minorities\n\nwould, id. at 576 n.71.\n\n      Though it declared that the law school's 1992 admissions\n\nprogram violated the plaintiffs' equal protection rights, the court\n\ngranted little relief.       First, the court did not order that the\n\nplaintiffs be admitted to the law school.         Instead, it used what it\n\nsaw as analogous title VII caselaw on burden-shifting to hold that\n\nwhile the state had committed a constitutional violation, the\n\nplaintiffs had the ultimate burden of proving damages. Id. at 579-\n\n80.   The court then found that the defendants had proffered a\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory reason for denying the plaintiffs\n\nadmission and that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of\n\nshowing that they would have been admitted but for the unlawful\n\nsystem.   Id. at 582.\n\n      Moreover, the court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto prospective injunctive relief, because \"of the law school's\n\nvoluntary change to a procedure, which on paper and from the\n\ntestimony, appears to remedy the defects the Court has found in the\n\n1992 procedure.\" Id.15 To pass muster under the court's reasoning,\n\n\n\n      15\n         Shortly before trial, apparently in response to the filing of this\nlawsuit, the law school modified its 1992 admissions practices to fit the\ndistrict court's view of the proper constitutional system. See id. at 582\nn.87.\n\n                                      14\n\fthe law school simply had to have one committee that at one time\n\nduring the process reviewed all applications and did not establish\n\nseparate TI numbers to define the presumptive denial categories.\n\nIn other words, if the law school applied the same academic\n\nstandards, but had commingled the minority review in the discre-\n\ntionary zone with the review of whites, its program would not have\n\nbeen struck down.       The same admissions result would occur, but the\n\nprocess would be \"fair.\"        Id.\n\n     Finally, the court determined that the only appropriate relief\n\nwas a declaratory judgment and an order allowing the plaintiffs to\n\nreapply to the school without charge.          Id. at 582-83.      No compensa-\n\ntory or punitive damages, the court reasoned, could be awarded\n\nwhere the plaintiffs had proven no harm.               Moreover, the court\n\nreasoned   that    as   the   law   school   had   promised   to    change   its\n\nadmissions program by abandoning the two-committee system, no\n\nprospective injunctive relief was justified.\n\n\n\n                                      III.\n\n     The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause \"is to\n\nprevent    the    States   from     purposefully    discriminating     between\n\nindividuals on the basis of race.\"           Shaw v.

As Justice O'Connor indicated in Croson:\n\n      Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justifications\n      for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of\n      determining what classifications are \"benign\" or\n      \"remedial\" and what classifications are in fact motivated\n      by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple\n      racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny\n      is to \"smoke out\" illegitimate uses of race by assuring\n      that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important\n      enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test\n      also ensures that the means chosen \"fit\" this compelling\n      goal so closely that there is little or no possibility\n      that the motive for the classification was illegitimate\n      racial prejudice or stereotype.\n\nId. at 493 (plurality opinion).\n\n      Under the strict scrutiny analysis, we ask two questions:\n\n(1) Does the racial classification serve a compelling government\n\ninterest, and (2) is it narrowly tailored to the achievement of\n\nthat goal?      Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2111, 2117.            As the Adarand\n\nCourt      emphasized,   strict   scrutiny   ensures   that    \"courts   will\n\nconsistently give racial classifications . . . detailed examination\n\nboth as to ends and as to means.\"          Id.18\n\n\n      17\n         Adarand, 115 S.

In that case, Allan Bakke, a white\n\nmale, was denied admission to the Medical School of the University\n\nof California at Davis, a state-run institution. Claiming that the\n\nState   had    discriminated   against      him   impermissibly     because    it\n\noperated two separate admissions programs for the medical school,\n\nhe brought suit under the state constitution, title VI, and the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.\n\n     Under     the   medical   school's     admissions    system,    the   white\n\napplicants, who comprised the majority of the prospective students,\n\napplied    through    the   general    admissions     program.       A   special\n\nadmissions program was reserved for members of \"minority groups\" or\n\ngroups designated as \"economically and/or educationally disadvan-\n\ntaged.\"       The university set aside sixteen of the one hundred\n\npositions in the entering class for candidates from the special\n\nprogram.\n\n\n                                       19\n\f     The California Supreme Court struck down the program on equal\n\nprotection grounds, enjoined any consideration of race in the\n\nadmissions process, and ordered that Bakke be admitted. The United\n\nStates Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part in an\n\nopinion announced by Justice Powell.        438 U.S. at 271-72 (opinion\n\nof Powell, J.).     The Court reached no consensus on a justification\n\nfor its result, however.        Six Justices filed opinions, none of\n\nwhich garnered more than four votes (including the writer's).           The\n\ntwo major opinionsSSone four-Justice opinion by Justices Brennan,\n\nWhite, Marshall, and Blackmun and one by Justice Stevens in which\n\nChief     Justice   Burger    and   Justices   Stewart   and     Rehnquist\n\njoinedSSreflected completely contrary views of the law.\n\n     While Justice Powell found the program unconstitutional under\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause and affirmed Bakke's admission, Justice\n\nStevens declined to reach the constitutional issue and upheld\n\nBakke's admission under title VI.         Justice Powell also concluded\n\nthat the California Supreme Court's proscription of the consider-\n\nation of race in admissions could not be sustained.            This became\n\nthe judgment of the Court, as the four-Justice opinion by Justice\n\nBrennan    opined   that   racial   classifications   designed   to   serve\n\nremedial purposes should receive only intermediate scrutiny. These\n\nJustices would have upheld the admissions program under this\n\nintermediate scrutiny, as it served the substantial and benign\n\npurpose of remedying past societal discrimination.\n\n     Hence, Justice Powell's opinion has appeared to represent the\n\n\"swing vote,\" and though, in significant part, see id. at 272 n.*,\n\n\n                                     20\n\fit was joined by no other Justice, it has played a prominent role\n\nin subsequent debates concerning the impact of Bakke.21               In the\n\npresent case, the significance of Justice Powell's opinion is its\n\ndiscussion of compelling state interests under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.    See id. at 305-15.       Specifically, after Justice Powell\n\nrecognized    that    the    proper    level    of   review    for    racial\n\nclassifications is strict scrutiny, id. at 305-06, he rejected and\n\naccepted respective justifications for the school's program as\n\n\"substantial enough to support the use of a suspect classifica-\n\ntion,\" id. at 306.           Notably, because the first step in\n\nreviewing an affirmative action program is a determination of the\n\nstate's interests at stake,22 it often is the determinative step.\n\nJustice Powell outlined the four state interests proffered by the\n\nBakke defendants:\n\n     The special admissions program purports to serve the\n     purposes of: (i) \"reducing the historic deficit of\n     traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools\n     and in the medical profession,\"; (ii) countering the\n     effects of societal discrimination; (iii) increasing the\n     number of physicians who will practice in communities\n     currently underserved; and (iv) obtaining the educational\n     benefits that flow from an ethnically diverse student\n     body.\n\n\n\n     21\n         See, e.g., Vincent Blasi, Bakke as Precedent: Does Mr. Justice\nPowell Have a Theory?, 67 CAL. L. REV. 21, 24 (1979) (arguing that Bakke's\nprecedential force is governed by the common conclusions of Justices Powell\nand Stevens, though it is erroneous to conclude that Powell's opinion has\n\"controlling significance on all questions\"); Robert G.

REV. 69 (1979) (Justice Powell's\n\"tiebreaking opinion . . . has acquired wide pragmatic appeal.\").\n     22\n        As affirmative action programs are by definition purposeful classifi-\ncations by race, they do not present the problem of governmental action that\nis facially neutral but has a disparate impact and is motivated by race.

Justice Powell therefore approved\n\nof a consideration of ethnicity as \"one element in a range of\n\nfactors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of\n\na heterogeneous student body.\"        Id.\n\n       The next step for Justice Powell was to decide whether the\n\nmedical school's program was necessary to further the goal of\n\ndiversity.     He said it was not.      As the program made race the only\n\ndetermining factor for a certain number of the open spots that had\n\n\n\n       25\n         Saying that a university has a First Amendment interest in this con-\ntext is somewhat troubling. Both the medical school in Bakke and, in our\ncase, the law school are state institutions. The First Amendment generally\nprotects citizens from the actions of government, not government from its\ncitizens.\n      Significantly, Sweezy involved a person who was called before the Attor-\nney General of New Hampshire to answer for alleged subversive activities. He\ndeclined on First Amendment grounds to answer questions about a lecture he had\ndelivered at the University of New Hampshire. While Justice Frankfurter spoke\nof a university's interest in openness and free inquiry, it was plainly\nthrough the First Amendment rights of individual scholars. 354 U.S. at 262,\n266-67 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in result).\n\n                                     23\n\fbeen set aside, it did not further full diversity but only a\n\nconception of that term limited to race.\n\n     Justice Powell speculated that a program in which \"race or\n\nethnic background may be deemed a 'plus' in a particular appli-\n\ncant's file, yet does not insulate the individual from comparison\n\nwith all the other candidates for the available seats,\" might pass\n\nmuster.    Id. at 317.   The Justice did not define what he meant by\n\na \"plus,\" but he did write that a \"plus\" program would be one in\n\nwhich an\n\n     applicant who loses out to another candidate receiving a\n     'plus' on the basis of ethnic background will not have\n     been foreclosed from all consideration for that seat\n     simply because he was not the right color or had the\n     wrong surname.   It would only mean that his combined\n     qualifications, which may have included similar nonobjec-\n     tive factors, did not outweigh those of another appli-\n     cant. His qualifications would have been weighted fairly\n     and competitively, and he would have no basis to com-\n     plaint of unequal treatment under the Fourteenth Amend-\n     ment.\n\nId. at 318.\n\n     Under this conception of the Fourteenth Amendment, a program\n\nthat considered a host of factors that include race would be\n\nconstitutional, even if an applicant's race \"tipped the scales\"\n\namong qualified applicants.      What a school could not do is to\n\nrefuse to compare applicants of different races or establish a\n\nstrict quota on the basis of race.     In sum, Justice Powell found\n\nthe school's program to be an unconstitutional \"quota\" system, but\n\nhe intimated that the Constitution would allow schools to continue\n\nto use race in a wide-ranging manner.\n\n\n\n\n                                  24\n\f                                       2.\n\n     Here, the plaintiffs argue that diversity is not a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest under superseding Supreme Court precedent.\n\nInstead, they believe that the Court finally has recognized that\n\nonly the remedial use of race is compelling.           In the alternative,\n\nthe plaintiffs assert that the district court misapplied Justice\n\nPowell's Bakke standard, as the law school program here uses race\n\nas a strong determinant rather than a mere \"plus\" factor and, in\n\nany case, the preference is not narrowly applied.             The law school\n\nmaintains, on the other hand, that Justice Powell's formulation in\n\nBakke is law and must be followedSSat least in the context of\n\nhigher education.\n\n     We agree with the plaintiffs that any consideration of race or\n\nethnicity by the law school for the purpose of achieving a diverse\n\nstudent body is not a compelling interest under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.    Justice Powell's argument in Bakke garnered only his\n\nown vote and has never represented the view of a majority of the\n\nCourt in Bakke or any other case.           Moreover, subsequent Supreme\n\nCourt decisions regarding education state that non-remedial state\n\ninterests will never justify racial classifications.            Finally, the\n\nclassification of persons on the basis of race for the purpose of\n\ndiversity frustrates, rather than facilitates, the goals of equal\n\nprotection.\n\n     Justice Powell's view in Bakke is not binding precedent on\n\nthis issue.     While he announced the judgment, no other Justice\n\njoined in     that   part   of   the   opinion   discussing   the   diversity\n\n\n                                       25\n\frationale.   In Bakke, the word \"diversity\" is mentioned    nowhere\n\nexcept in Justice Powell's single-Justice opinion.     In fact, the\n\nfour-Justice opinion, which would have upheld the special admis-\n\nsions program under intermediate scrutiny, implicitly rejected\n\nJustice Powell's position.    See 438 U.S. at 326 n.1 (Brennan,\n\nWhite, Marshall, and Blackmun JJ., concurring in the judgment in\n\npart and dissenting) (\"We also agree with Mr. Justice POWELL that\n\na plan like the \"Harvard\" plan . . . is constitutional under our\n\napproach, at least so long as the use of race to achieve an\n\nintegrated student body is necessitated by the lingering effects of\n\npast discrimination.\") (emphasis added).    Justice Stevens declined\n\nto discuss the constitutional issue.   See id. at 412 (Stevens, J.,\n\nconcurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\n\n     Thus, only one Justice concluded that race could be used\n\nsolely for the reason of obtaining a heterogenous student body. As\n\nthe Adarand Court states, the Bakke Court did not express a\n\nmajority view and is questionable as binding precedent.   115 S. Ct.\n\nat 2109 (\"The Court's failure in Bakke . . . left unresolved the\n\nproper analysis for remedial race-based government action.\").\n\n     Since Bakke, the Court has accepted the diversity rationale\n\nonly once in its cases dealing with race.

The interest in increasing the diversity\n       of broadcast viewpoints is clearly not a compelling\n       interest. It is simply too amorphous, too insubstantial,\n       and too unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing\n       racial classifications.\n\n497 U.S. at 612 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).             Indeed, the majority\n\nin Metro Broadcasting had not claimed otherwise and decided only\n\nthat such an interest was \"important.\"           Justice Thomas, who joined\n\nthe Court after Metro Broadcasting was decided, roundly condemned\n\n\"benign\" discrimination in his recent Adarand opinion, in which he\n\nsuggests that the diversity rationale is inadequate to meet strict\n\nscrutiny.     See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2119 (Thomas, J., concurring\n\nin part and concurring in judgment).27\n\n       In short, there has been no indication from the Supreme Court,\n\nother than Justice Powell's lonely opinion in Bakke, that the\n\nstate's interest in diversity constitutes a compelling justifica-\n\ntion    for   governmental    race-based      discrimination.         Subsequent\n\nSupreme Court caselaw strongly suggests, in fact, that it is not.\n\n       Within the general principles of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\n\nuse of      race   in   admissions   for    diversity   in   higher   education\n\n\n       27\n         The law school places much reliance upon Justice O'Connor's concur-\nrence in Wygant for the proposition that Justice Powell's Bakke formulation is\nstill viable. In her 1986 Wygant opinion, in the context of discussing Jus-\ntice Powell's opinion, Justice O'Connor noted that \"although its precise con-\ntours are uncertain, a state interest in the promotion of racial diversity has\nbeen found sufficiently 'compelling,' at least in the context of higher educa-\ntion, to support the use of racial considerations in furthering that inter-\nest.\" 476 U.S. at 286 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment).\n      The law school's argument is not persuasive. Justice O'Connor's state-\nment is purely descriptive and did not purport to express her approval or\ndisapproval of diversity as a compelling interest. Her subsequent statements\noutlined above in Croson and Metro Broadcasting suggest strongly that reliance\nupon this statement in Wygant is unjustified.\n\n                                       28\n\fcontradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection.\n\nDiversity fosters, rather than minimizes, the use of race.                   It\n\ntreats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals.                It may\n\nfurther remedial purposes but, just as likely, may promote improper\n\nracial stereotypes, thus fueling racial hostility.\n\n       The use of race, in and of itself, to choose students simply\n\nachieves a student body that looks different.            Such a criterion is\n\nno more rational on its own terms than would be choices based upon\n\nthe physical size or blood type of applicants.             Thus, the Supreme\n\nCourt has long held that governmental actors cannot justify their\n\ndecisions solely because of race.          See, e.g., Croson, 488 U.S. at\n\n496 (plurality opinion);          Bakke, 438 U.S. at 307 (opinion of\n\nPowell, J.).\n\n       Accordingly, we see the caselaw as sufficiently established\n\nthat   the   use   of   ethnic    diversity   simply     to    achieve   racial\n\nheterogeneity, even as part of the consideration of a number of\n\nfactors, is unconstitutional.          Were we to decide otherwise, we\n\nwould contravene precedent that we are not authorized to challenge.\n\n       While the use of race per se is proscribed, state-supported\n\nschools may reasonably consider a host of factors))some of which\n\nmay have some correlation with race))in making admissions deci-\n\nsions.    The federal courts have no warrant to intrude on those\n\nexecutive and legislative judgments unless the distinctions intrude\n\non   specific   provisions   of    federal    law   or   the   Constitution.\n\n       A university may properly favor one applicant over another\n\nbecause of his ability to play the cello, make a downfield tackle,\n\n\n                                      29\n\for   understand   chaos     theory.      An    admissions   process   may   also\n\nconsider an applicant's home state or relationship to school\n\nalumni.      Law schools specifically may look at things such as\n\nunusual or substantial extracurricular activities in college, which\n\nmay be atypical factors affecting undergraduate grades.                  Schools\n\nmay even consider factors such as whether an applicant's parents\n\nattended     college   or        the   applicant's      economic   and   social\n\nbackground.28\n\n      For this reason, race often is said to be justified in the\n\ndiversity context, not on its own terms, but as a proxy for other\n\ncharacteristics that institutions of higher education value but\n\nthat do not raise similar constitutional concerns.29 Unfortunately,\n\nthis approach simply replicates the very harm that the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment was designed to eliminate.\n\n      The    assumption     is    that   a    certain   individual    possesses\n\ncharacteristics by virtue of being a member of a certain racial\n\ngroup.      This assumption, however, does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n\"[T]he use of a racial characteristic to establish a presumption\n\nthat the individual also possesses other, and socially relevant,\n\ncharacteristics, exemplifies, encourages, and legitimizes the mode\n\nof thought and behavior that underlies most prejudice and bigotry\n\nin modern America.\"       Richard A. Posner, The DeFunis Case and the\n\n\n      28\n        The law school's admissions program makes no distinction among black\nand Mexican American applicants in an effort to determine which of them, for\nexample, may have been culturally or educationally disadvantaged.\n      29\n        For example, Justice Powell apparently felt that persons with differ-\nent ethnic backgrounds would bring diverse \"experiences, outlooks, and ideas\"\nto the medical school.

Even though it is frequently\n     efficient to sort people by race    or ethnic origin, because racial\n     or ethnic identity may be a good    proxy for functional classifica-\n     tions, efficiency is rejected as    a basis for governmental action\n     in this context.\nPosner, supra, at 22.\n\n                                        31\n\fin San Antonio and, more significantly, is raising a severely\n\nhandicapped child.

The message from\n     government is written very large when these plans proliferate: a\n                                                              (continued...)\n\n                                       33\n\f     Finally, the use of race to achieve diversity undercuts the\n\nultimate goal of the Fourteenth Amendment:                the end of racially-\n\nmotivated state action.        Justice Powell's conception of race as a\n\n\"plus\" factor would allow race always to be a potential factor in\n\nadmissions decisionmaking.         While Justice Blackmun recognized the\n\ntension inherent in using race-conscious remedies to achieve a\n\nrace-neutral society, he nevertheless accepted it as necessary.\n\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 405.

Thus, that portion of the\n\ndistrict court's opinion upholding the diversity rationale is\n\nreversibly flawed.37\n\n\n\n                                     B.\n\n     We now turn to the district court's determination that \"the\n\nremedial purpose of the law school's affirmative action program is\n\n\n\n(...continued)\n     race. Indeed, that is the great lesson for government itself to\n     teach: in all we do in life, whatever we do in life, to treat any\n     person less well than another or to favor any more than another\n     for being black or white or brown or red, is wrong.

We do note that even if a \"plus\"\nsystem were permissible, it likely would be impossible to maintain such a\nsystem without degeneration into nothing more than a \"quota\" program. See\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 378 (\"For purposes of constitutional adjudication, there is\nno difference between [setting aside a certain number of places for minorities\nand using minority status as a positive factor].\") (Brennan, White, Marshall,\nand Blackmun, JJ., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).\nIndeed, in this case, the law school appeared to be especially adept at\nmeeting its yearly \"goals.\" See Hopwood, 861 F.

The\n\nplaintiffs argue that the court erred by finding that the law\n\nschool could employ racial criteria to remedy the present effects\n\nof past discrimination in Texas's primary and secondary schools.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the proper unit for analysis is the law\n\nschool, and the state has shown no recognizable present effects of\n\nthe law school's past discrimination.

Moreover, we also must review the\n\ncourt's identification of what types of present effects of past\n\ndiscrimination,     if    proven,   would   be   sufficient   under   strict\n\nscrutiny review.         Finally, where the state actor puts forth a\n\n\n\n      39\n         Unfortunately, the precise scope of allowable state action is of\nsomewhat undefined contours. Indeed, it is not evident whether permitted\nremedial action extends to the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" This\nlanguage, derived from Justice Brennan's opinion in Bakke, 438 U.S. at 362-66,\nappears intended to present little resistance to wide-ranging affirmative\naction plans.\n\n      While Justice Brennan began by stating that schools have a duty\naffirmatively to erase the vestiges of their past discriminatory practices, he\ncompared this duty to the power of Congress to enforce § 1 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment through § 5. He reasoned that under that wide-ranging power, the\nbeneficiaries of such a program need not present proof that they were\ndiscriminated against; a showing that they were in the general class was\nsufficient.\nId. at 363-64. Nor would a school need judicial findings of past\ndiscrimination. Id. at 364. Finally, he argued that such beneficiaries would\nnot even\nhave to show that that school had a history of past discrimination, but need\nonly suggest that they were the victims of general societal discrimination\nthat prevented them from being otherwise qualified to enter the school. Id.\nat 365-66. Hence, under this standard, almost any school could adopt an\naffirmative action plan.\n      There is no question, however, that subsequent Supreme Court opinions,\nnotably Wygant and Croson, have rejected broad state programs that purport to\nbe remedial and that, presumably, would have satisfied Justice Brennan's\nstandard for meeting the \"present effects of past discrimination.\" And some\nmembers of the Court would limit any remedial purpose to the actual victims of\ndiscrimination. See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2118 (Scalia, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (\"[G]overnment can never have a 'compelling\ninterest' in discriminating on the basis of race in order to 'make up' for\npast racial discrimination in the opposite direction.\"). Nevertheless, we will\nnot eschew use of the phrase \"present effects of past discrimination,\" as we\nused this language in Hopwood I, 21 F.3d at 605, and another circuit did so in\nPodberesky v.

A plurality rejected the theory that such a\n\nprogram was justified because it provided minority role models.\n\nId. at 274-77 (plurality opinion).          Such a claim was based upon\n\nremedying    \"societal    discrimination,\"      a   rationale    the   Court\n\nconsistently has rejected as a basis for affirmative action.\n\nAccordingly, the state's use of remedial racial classifications is\n\nlimited to the harm caused by a specific state actor.41\n\n\n      40\n         See Wygant, 476 U.S. at 286 (opinion of O'Connor, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (\"The Court is in agreement that whatever the\nformulation employed, remedying past or present racial discrimination by a\nstate actor is a sufficiently weighty state interest to warrant remedial use\nof a carefully constructed affirmative action program.\").\n     41\n        See also id. at 288 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring\nin judgment) (\"I agree with the plurality that a government agency's interest\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                     38\n\f     Moreover, the plurality in Wygant held that before a state\n\nactor properly could implement such a plan, it \"must ensure that\n\n. . . it has strong evidence that remedial action is warranted.\"\n\nId. at 277.    Accord id. at 289 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part\n\nand concurring in judgment).

Writing for the Court, Justice\n\nO'Connor   struck    down   a   minority    business      set-aside   program\n\nimplemented by the City of Richmond and justified on remedial\n\ngrounds.   While the district court opined that sufficient evidence\n\nhad been found by the city to believe that such a program was\n\nnecessary to remedy the present effects of past discrimination in\n\nthe construction industry, the Court held:\n\n     Like the \"role model\" theory employed in Wygant, a\n     generalized   assertion   that   there  had   been   past\n     discrimination in an entire industry provides no guidance\n     for a legislative body to determine the precise scope of\n     the injury it seeks to remedy.       It 'has no logical\n     stopping point.' Wygant, 476 U.S. at 275 (plurality\n     opinion). 'Relief' for such an ill-defined wrong could\n     extend until the percentage of public contracts awarded\n     to [minority businesses] in Richmond mirrored the\n     percentage of minorities in the population as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nin remedying 'societal' discrimination, that is discrimination not traceable\nto its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass\nconstitutional muster under strict scrutiny.\").\n\n                                       39\n\f488 U.S. at 498.42             The Court refused to accept indicia of past\n\ndiscrimination        in       anything    but    \"the    Richmond     construction\n\nindustry.\"       Id. at 505.\n\n       In addition, in a passage of particular significance to the\n\ninstant       case,   the      Court   analogized   the   employment     contractor\n\nsituation to that of higher education and noted that \"[l]ike claims\n\nthat discrimination in primary and secondary schooling justifies a\n\nrigid racial preference in medical school admissions, an amorphous\n\nclaim that there has been past discrimination in a particular\n\nindustry cannot justify the use of an unyielding quota.\"                       Id. at\n\n499.        Such claims were based upon \"sheer speculation\" about how\n\nmany minorities would be in the contracting business absent past\n\ndiscrimination.          Id.\n\n       Applying the teachings of Croson and Wygant, we conclude that\n\nthe district court erred in expanding the remedial justification to\n\nreach all public education within the State of Texas.                   The Supreme\n\nCourt repeatedly has warned that the use of racial remedies must be\n\ncarefully limited, and a remedy reaching all education within a\n\nstate addresses a putative injury that is vague and amorphous.                       It\n\nhas    \"no     logical     stopping     point.\"     Wygant,      476   U.S.    at   275\n\n(plurality opinion).\n\n       The     district     court's     holding   employs   no    viable      limiting\n\nprinciple.       If a state can \"remedy\" the present effects of past\n\ndiscrimination in its primary and secondary schools, it also would\n\n\n       42\n        Justice O'Connor was joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices\nWhite, Stevens, and Kennedy in this portion of the opinion.\n\n                                           40\n\fbe allowed to award broad-based preferences in hiring, government\n\ncontracts, licensing, and any other state activity that in some way\n\nis affected by the educational attainment of the applicants.                  This\n\nvery argument was made in Croson and rejected:\n\n      The \"evidence\" relied upon by the dissent, history of\n      school   desegregation   in    Richmond   and    numerous\n      congressional reports, does little to define the scope of\n      any injury to minority contractors in Richmond or the\n      necessary remedy. The factors relied upon by the dissent\n      could justify a preference of any size or duration.\n\n488   U.S.    at    505.    The   defendants'     argument    here   is   equally\n\nexpansive.43\n\n      Strict scrutiny is meant to ensure that the purpose of a\n\nracial preference is remedial.          Yet when one state actor begins to\n\njustify racial preferences based upon the actions of other state\n\nagencies,     the    remedial     actor's     competence     to   determine   the\n\nexistence and scope of the harmSSand the appropriate reach of the\n\nremedySSis called into question.             The school desegregation cases,\n\nfor example, concentrate on school districtsSSsingular government\n\nunitsSSand the use of interdistrict remedies is strictly limited.\n\nSee Missouri v.

Thus,    one\n\n\n\n      43\n        The fact that the plaintiffs named the State of Texas as one\ndefendant does not mean that it is proper to scrutinize the state as the\nrelevant past discriminator. This argument confuses a theory of liability\nwith a justification for a limited racial remedy. The State of Texas simply\nmay be responsible for the wrongs of the law school, which is a governmental\nentity the state has created. The Supreme Court, however, has limited the\nremedial interest to the harm wrought by a specific governmental unit.\n\n                                        41\n\fjustification for limiting the remedial powers of a state actor is\n\nthat the specific agency involved is best able to measure the harm\n\nof its past discrimination.\n\n     Here, however, the law school has no comparative advantage in\n\nmeasuring the present effects of discrimination in primary and\n\nsecondary   schools   in    Texas.      Such    a     task   becomes   even   more\n\nimprobable where, as here, benefits are conferred on students who\n\nattended out-of-state or private schools for such education.                  Such\n\nboundless \"remedies\" raise a constitutional concern beyond mere\n\ncompetence.     In this situation, an inference is raised that the\n\nprogram was the result of racial social engineering rather a desire\n\nto implement a remedy.\n\n     No one disputes that in the past, Texas state actors have\n\ndiscriminated against some minorities in public schools.                 In this\n\nsense,   some   lingering    effects    of     such    discrimination    is   not\n\n\"societal,\" if that term is meant to exclude all state action.                 But\n\nthe very program at issue here shows how remedying such past wrongs\n\nmay be expanded beyond any reasonable limits.\n\n     Even if, arguendo, the state is the proper government unit to\n\nscrutinize, the law school's admissions program would not withstand\n\nour review.     For the admissions scheme to pass constitutional\n\nmuster, the State of Texas, through its legislature, would have to\n\nfind that past segregation has present effects; it would have to\n\ndetermine the magnitude of those present effects; and it would need\n\nto limit carefully the \"plus\" given to applicants to remedy that\n\nharm.    A broad program that sweeps in all minorities with a remedy\n\n\n                                       42\n\fthat     is    in   no   way     related    to    past       harms   cannot      survive\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.           Obviously, none of those predicates has\n\nbeen satisfied here.\n\n       We further reject the proposition that the University of Texas\n\nSystem, rather than the law school, is the appropriate governmental\n\nunit for       measuring     a   constitutional       remedy.        The   law    school\n\noperates as a functionally separate unit within the system.                          As\n\nwith all law schools, it maintains its own separate admissions\n\nprogram. The law school hires faculty members that meet the unique\n\nrequirements        of   a   law   school       and    has    its    own   deans    for\n\nadministrative purposes.           Thus, for much the same reason that we\n\nrejected the educational system as the proper measureSSgenerally\n\nensuring that the legally-imposed racially discriminatory program\n\nis remedialSSwe conclude that the University of Texas System is\n\nitself        too   expansive      an   entity        to     scrutinize     for    past\n\ndiscrimination.44\n\n       44\n        And again, any such remedy here would be grossly speculative. As the\ndefendants concede and the district court found, there is no recent history of\novert sanctioned discrimination at the University of Texas. Hopwood, 861\nF. Supp. at 572. Nor does the record even suggest such discrimination at any\nof the other component schools of the University of Texas System. Thus, any\nharm caused to the students of those institutions would be the result of the\npresent effects of past discrimination.\n      We do note that the law school is not autonomous. In Texas, the\nmanagement of higher education has been divided by the legislature into\ndifferent \"systems.\" See 12 TEX. JUR. 3D, Colleges and Universities § 2 (1993).\nThe\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, with which the law school is associated, is\npart of the University of Texas System. TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. §§ 67.01 to 67.62\n(West 1991). Accordingly, the legislature, which has ultimate control over\nthe school, has delegated its \"management and control\" to the regents of the\nUniversity of Texas System. Id. § 67.02. Thus, the law school is governed by\nboth the legislature and the university's board of regents.\n      Yet, while the state's higher authorities may have the power to require\nthe law school to remedy its past wrongs, they may do so consistently with the\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                           43\n\f      In sum, for purposes of determining whether the law school's\n\nadmissions system properly can act as a remedy for the present\n\neffects of past discrimination, we must identify the law school as\n\nthe relevant alleged past discriminator.           The fact that the law\n\nschool ultimately may be subject to the directives of others, such\n\nas   the   board   of   regents,   the    university   president,    or   the\n\nlegislature, does not change the fact that the relevant putative\n\ndiscriminator in this case is still the law school.            In order for\n\nany of these entities to direct a racial preference program at the\n\nlaw school, it must be because of past wrongs at that school.\n\n\n\n                                     2.\n\n      Next, the relevant governmental discriminator must prove that\n\nthere are present effects of past discrimination of the type that\n\njustify the racial classifications at issue:\n\n      To have a present         effect of past discrimination\n      sufficient to justify    the program, the party seeking to\n      implement the program    must, at a minimum, prove that the\n      effect it proffers is    caused by the past discrimination\n      and that the effect is   of sufficient magnitude to justify\n      the program.\n\nPodberesky v.

Moreover, as part of showing that\n\nthe alleged present effects of past discrimination in fact justify\n\nthe racial preference program at issue, the law school must show\n\n\n\n(...continued)\nConstitution only if the remedial actions are directed at the law school.\nThis requirement is what the Supreme Court dictated by limiting the remedial\npurpose to the \"governmental unit involved.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 274\n(plurality opinion).\n\n                                     44\n\fthat it adopted the program specifically to remedy the identified\n\npresent effects of the past discrimination.\n\n       Here,   according   to   the   district   court:      \"The   evidence\n\npresented at trial indicates those effects include the law school's\n\nlingering reputation in the minority community, particularly with\n\nprospective students, as a \"white\" school; an underrepresentation\n\nof minorities in the student body; and some perception that the law\n\nschool is a hostile environment for minorities.\"            861 F. Supp. at\n\n572.   Plaintiffs now argue that these three alleged effects are at\n\nmost examples of societal discrimination, which the Supreme Court\n\nhas found not to be a valid remedial basis.               \"The effects must\n\nthemselves be examined to see whether they were caused by the past\n\ndiscrimination and whether they are of a type that justifies the\n\nprogram.\"      Podberesky, 38 F.3d at 154.\n\n       As a legal matter, the district court erred in concluding that\n\nthe first and third effects it identifiedSSbad reputation and\n\nhostile environmentSSwere sufficient to sustain the use of race in\n\nthe admissions process.          The Fourth Circuit examined similar\n\narguments in Podberesky, a recent case that struck down the use of\n\nrace-based scholarships.        The university in that case sought, in\n\npart, to justify a separate scholarship program based solely upon\n\nrace because of the university's \"poor reputation within the\n\nAfrican-American community\" and because \"the atmosphere on campus\n\n[was] perceived as being hostile to African-American students.\"\n\nId. at 152.\n\n       The Podberesky court rejected the notion that either of these\n\n\n                                      45\n\frationales could support the single-race scholarship program. The\n\ncourt reasoned that any poor reputation by the school \"is tied\n\nsolely to knowledge of the University's discrimination before it\n\nadmitted African-American students.\"          Id. at 154.    The court found\n\nthat \"mere knowledge of historical fact is not the kind of present\n\neffect that can justify a race-exclusive remedy.                  If it were\n\notherwise, as long as there are people who have access to history\n\nbooks, there will be programs such as this.\"           Id.\n\n     We concur in the Fourth Circuit's observation that knowledge\n\nof   historical    fact   simply     cannot     justify      current    racial\n\nclassifications.   Even if, as the defendants argue, the law school\n\nmay have a bad reputation in the minority community, \"[t]he case\n\nagainst   race-based   preferences    does     not   rest    on   the   sterile\n\nassumption that American society is untouched or unaffected by the\n\ntragic oppression of its past.\"      Maryland Troopers Ass'n v.

Similarly, one cannot conclude that the law\n\nschool's   past   discrimination   has   created   any   current   hostile\n\nenvironment for minorities.    While the school once did practice de\n\njure discrimination in denying admission to blacks, the Court in\n\nSweatt v. Painter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104804\"><a href=\"/opinion/104804/sweatt-v-painter/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1950), struck down the law\n\nschool's program. Any other discrimination by the law school ended\n\nin the 1960's.    Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 555.\n\n     By the late 1960's, the school had implemented its first\n\nprogram designed to recruit minorities, id. at 557, and it now\n\nengages in an extensive minority recruiting program that includes\n\na significant amount of scholarship money.         The vast majority of\n\nthe faculty, staff, and students at the law school had absolutely\n\nnothing to do with any discrimination that the law school practiced\n\nin the past.\n\n     In such a case, one cannot conclude that a hostile environment\n\nis the present effect of past discrimination.        Any racial tension\n\nat the law school is most certainly the result of present societal\n\ndiscrimination and, if anything, is contributed to, rather than\n\nalleviated by, the overt and prevalent consideration of race in\n\nadmissions.\n\n     Even if the law school's alleged current lingering reputation\n\nin the minority communitySSand the perception that the school is a\n\nhostile environment for minoritiesSSwere considered to be the\n\npresent effects of past discrimination, rather than the result of\n\nsocietal discrimination, they could not constitute compelling state\n\n\n                                   47\n\finterests     justifying   the    use        of   racial   classifications   in\n\nadmissions.     A bad reputation within the minority community is\n\nalleviated not by the consideration of race in admissions, but by\n\nschool action designed directly to enhance its reputation in that\n\ncommunity.\n\n     Minority students who are aided by the law school's racial\n\npreferences have already made the decision to apply, despite the\n\nreputation. And, while prior knowledge that they will get a \"plus\"\n\nmight make potential minorities more likely to apply, such an\n\ninducement does nothing, per se, to change any hostile environment.\n\nAs we have noted, racial preferences, if anything, can compound the\n\nproblem of a hostile environment.45\n\n     The law school wisely concentrates only on the second effect\n\nthe district court identified:          underrepresentation of minorities\n\nbecause of past discrimination.              The law school argues that we\n\nshould consider the prior discrimination by the State of Texas and\n\nits educational system rather than of the law school.               The school\n\ncontends that this prior discrimination by the state had a direct\n\neffect on the educational attainment of the pool of minority\n\napplicants and that the discriminatory admissions program was\n\nimplemented partially to discharge the school's duty of eliminating\n\nthe vestiges of past segregation.\n\n     As we have noted, the district court accepted the law school's\n\n\n\n      45\n         The testimony of several minority students underscores this point.\nThey stated generally that they felt that other students did not respect them\nbecause the other students assumed that minorities attained admission because\nof the racial preference program.\n\n                                        48\n\fargument that past discrimination on the part of the Texas school\n\nsystem (including primary and secondary schools), reaching back\n\nperhaps as far as the education of the parents of today's students,\n\njustifies the current use of racial classifications.46                No one\n\ndisputes that Texas has a history of racial discrimination in\n\neducation.     We have already discussed, however, that the Croson\n\nCourt unequivocally restricted the proper scope of the remedial\n\ninterest to the state actor that had previously discriminated. 488\n\nU.S. at 499.    The district court squarely found that \"[i]n recent\n\nhistory, there is no evidence of overt officially sanctioned\n\ndiscrimination at the University of Texas.\"          861 F. Supp. at 572.\n\nAs a result, past discrimination in education, other than at the\n\nlaw school, cannot justify the present consideration of race in law\n\nschool admissions.\n\n     The law school now attempts to circumvent this result by\n\nclaiming that its racial preference program is really a \"State of\n\n\n     46\n        The argument is that because the state discriminated in its primary\nand secondary school systems, the students' educational attainment was\nadversely affected, and this harm extended to their higher education, thus\njustifying giving current applicants a \"plus\" based on race. This reasoning\nis especially important in justifying benefits for Mexican Americans, as there\nis no evidence that the law school implemented de jure (or even de facto)\ndiscrimination against this group in its admissions process. Because this\nlogic ignores the relevant actions in this case, i.e., discrimination by the\nlaw school, it is not necessary for us to examine the potential causational\nflaws in the argument.\n      Moreover, if we did find that the past wrongs of Texas school districts\nwere the sort of discrimination that the law school could address, the school\nstill would have to prove the present effects of that past wrong. Without\nsome strong evidence in the record showing that today's law school applicants\nstill bear the mark of those past systems, such effects seem grossly\nspeculative. The district court simply assumed that \"[t]his segregation has\nhandicapped the educational achievement of many minorities. . . .\" 861 F.\nSupp. at 573. And we would still have to ask whether the program was narrowly\ntailored to this goal.\n\n\n                                     49\n\fTexas\" plan rather than a law school program.                   Under the law\n\nschool's reading of the facts, its program was the direct result of\n\nthe state's negotiations with what was then the United States\n\nDepartment of Health, Education and Welfare's Office for Civil\n\nRights (\"OCR\").    To bring the Texas public higher education system\n\ninto compliance with title VI, the state adopted the so-called\n\n\"Texas Plan.\"\n\n     In   light    of    our   preceding    discussion     on   the   relevant\n\ngovernmental unit, this argument is inapposite.             Even if the law\n\nschool were specifically ordered to adopt a racial preference\n\nprogram, its implementation at the law school would have to meet\n\nthe requirements of strict scrutiny.47\n\n     Moreover, these alleged actions in the 1980's are largely\n\nirrelevant for purposes of this appeal.            There is no indication\n\nthat the Texas Plan imposed a direct obligation upon the law\n\nschool.   To the contrary, the law school's admissions program was\n\nself-initiated.         Moreover, the current admissions program was\n\nformulated primarily in the 1990's, and the district court did not\n\nhold otherwise.    See 861 F. Supp. at 557 (\"Against this historical\n\nbackdrop [including Texas's dealing with the OCR], the law school's\n\ncommitment    to   affirmative     action    in   the    admissions    process\n\nevolved.\").     Thus it is no more correct to say that the State of\n\n      47\n         To the extent that the OCR has required actions that conflict with\nthe Constitution, the directives cannot stand.

The court held that the law school had a compelling\n\ninterest to \"desegregate\" the school through affirmative action.\n\n     The reliance upon Fordice is misplaced, however. The district\n\ncourt held that Fordice's mandate to schools \"to eliminate every\n\nvestige of racial segregation and discrimination\" made Croson\n\ninapplicable, 861 F. Supp. at 571, and reasoned that this mandate\n\nincludes the effects of such prior practices or policies.\n\n     Fordice does not overrule Croson.                 The central holding of\n\nFordice is that a state or one of its subdivisions must act to\n\nrepudiate the continuing \"policies or practices\" of discrimination.\n\n505 U.S. at 731-32.48        In other words, a state has an affirmative\n\nduty to remove policies, tied to the past, by which it continues to\n\ndiscriminate.       The Fordice Court did not address, in any way, a\n\nstate     actor's   duty    to   counter      the   present   effects      of    past\n\n\n\n     48\n          In more detail, the Fordice Court said the following:\n\n     If the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its\n     prior system that continue to have segregative effects))whether by\n     influencing student enrollment or by fostering segregation in\n     other facets of the university system))and such policies are\n     without sound educational justification and can be practicably\n     eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that\n     it has dismantled its prior system.\n505 U.S. at 731.\n\n                                         51\n\fdiscrimination that it did not cause.49\n\n     In sum, the law school has failed to show a compelling state\n\ninterest in remedying the present effects of past discrimination\n\nsufficient to maintain the use of race in its admissions system.\n\nAccordingly, it is unnecessary for us to examine the district\n\ncourt's determination that the law school's admissions program was\n\nnot narrowly tailored to meet the compelling interests that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously perceived.50\n\n\n      49\n         In Croson, Justice O'Connor did argue that a state may act to prevent\nits powers from being used to support private discrimination. 488 U.S. at\n491-92 (plurality opinion) (\"[A] state or local subdivision, (if delegated the\nauthority from the State) has the authority to eradicate the effects of\nprivate discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction.\") (emphasis\nadded). Hence, a specific state actor can act to prevent the state from being\nused as a \"passive participant\" in private discrimination. This power does\nnot create wide-ranging authority to remedy societal discrimination, however.\n     50\n        The plaintiffs argue that indeed there is no narrow tailoring, for at\nleast the following reasons: (1) In 1992, more than two-thirds of all\nadmission offers to blacks, and a majority of all blacks who matriculated,\ninvolved out-of-state residents, thus undercutting the law school's stated\npurpose of remedying past discrimination in Texas. (2) The system of\npreferences has no termination date, thus indicating that there is no\nconnection between the plan and a bona fide remedial purpose. (3) Preference\nis given even to blacks and Mexican Americans who graduated from private\nsecondary schools and thus did not suffer from state-ordered racial\ndiscrimination.\n      The law school apparently chose admission goals of 5% blacks and 10%\nMexican Americans because those are the respective percentages of college\ngraduates in Texas who are black and Mexican American. Nothing in the record,\nhowever, establishes any probative correlation between the degree of past\ndiscrimination and the percentage of students from a minority group who\ngraduate from college.\n\n      There is no history either of de jure discrimination against Mexican\nAmericans in education at any level in Texas or of de facto discrimination\nagainst Mexican Americans by the law school. Therefore, it is puzzling that\nthe law school would set an admissions goal for Mexican Americans that is\ntwice that of blacks, as to whom the history of de jure discrimination in\nTexas Education in general, and by the law school in particular, is\nirrefutable.\n      If fashioning a remedy for past discrimination is the goal, one would\nintuit that the minority group that has experienced the most discrimination\nwould have the lowest college graduation rate and therefore would be entitled\nto the most benefit from the designed remedy. The goals established by the\n                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                     52\n\f                                     IV.\n\n     While the district court declared the admissions program\n\nunconstitutional, it granted the plaintiffs only limited relief.\n\nThey had requested injunctive relief ordering that they be admitted\n\nto law school, compensatory and punitive damages, and prospective\n\ninjunctive relief preventing the school from using race as a factor\n\nin admissions.\n\n\n\n                                     A.\n\n     We must decide who bears the burden of proof on the damages\n\nissue.     The   district   court   refused   to   order   the   plaintiffs'\n\nadmission (or award any compensatory damages), as it found that\n\nthey had not met their burden of persuasion in attempting to show\n\nthat they would have been admitted absent the unconstitutional\n\nsystem.   861 F. Supp. at 579-82.51        The law school now argues that\n\nthe plaintiffs had the burden of persuasion on the issue of damages\n\nand that the district court's findings are not clearly erroneous.52\n\nThe plaintiffs maintain, as they did in the district court, that\n\nonce they had shown a constitutional violation, the burden of\n\n\n(...continued)\nlaw school are precisely the reverse of that intuitive expectation and are\nmore reflective of a goal of diversity (which we hold is not compelling) than\nof a goal of remedying past discrimination.\n     51\n        This finding also affected the court's analysis in denying\nprospective relief and compensatory damages.\n      52\n         The district court applied a burden-shifting scheme similar to the\nmethodology used in the title VII context. 861 F. Supp. at 579-80 (citing St.\nMary's Honor Ctr. v.

Healthy,    a    discharged   school    teacher    sued    for\n\nreinstatement, claiming his termination was a result of comments he\n\nhad made on a radio show, a violation of his First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights.      The Court devised a test of \"causation\" that\n\nplaced the burden of proving no harm on the defendant:\n\n     Initially, . . . the burden was properly placed upon the\n     respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally\n     protected, and that this conduct was a \"substantial\n     factor\"))or to put it in other words, that it was a\n     \"motivating factor\" in the Board's decision not to rehire\n     him. Respondent having carried that burden, however, the\n     District Court should have gone on to determine whether\n     the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence\n     that it would have reached the same decision as to the\n     respondent's reemployment even in the absence of the\n     protected conduct.\n\n429 U.S. at 287.    In Arlington Heights, the Court applied a similar\n\nrule where the decision of a zoning board was challenged as\n\nracially discriminatory.        See 429 U.S. at 270 n.21.     In sum, these\n\ncases allow a defendant, who intended to discriminate or otherwise\n\n     53\n        Some of Justice Powell's dicta in Bakke also squarely supports the\nplaintiffs' claim that once discrimination is proved, the defendant bears the\nburden of proving no damage. Bakke, 438 U.S. at 320 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n\n                                     54\n\fact unconstitutionally, to show that its action would have occurred\n\nregardless of that intent.\n\n     Courts are split on whether the Mt. Healthy rubric applies in\n\nracial preference cases.54         We conclude that the Mt. Healthy\n\nmethodology is appropriate in the instant case.            The Mt. Healthy\n\nplaintiff, like the present plaintiffs, brought a constitutional\n\nchallenge, and his injuries were analogous to the injuries alleged\n\nhere.   As we have said, the title VII burden-shifting scheme is\n\ndesigned to determine whether a violation of law has occurred.\n\n     In this case, there is no question that a constitutional\n\nviolation has occurred (as the district court found) and that the\n\nplaintiffs were harmed thereby.           See Adarand, 115 S. Ct. at 2105\n\n(\"The injury in cases of this kind is that a 'discriminatory\n\nclassification prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal\n\nfooting.'\") (citation omitted).           The Mt. Healthy burden-shifting\n\nexercise simply gives the defendant law school a second chance of\n\nprevailing by showing that the violation was largely harmless.\n\n     As the district court held, to the contrary, that plaintiffs\n\nhad the burden, it should revisit this issue in light of what we\n\nhave said in both the liability and remedial portions of this\n\n\n      54\n         Compare Henson v.

While we agree with the district court's conclusion that\n\nthe various defendants acted in good faith, there is no question\n\nthat they intended to treat the plaintiffs differently on account\n\nof their race.\n\n\n\n                                     B.\n\n     The    plaintiffs      argue    that,     because     they   proved    a\n\nconstitutional violation, and further violations were likely to\n\nresult, the district court erred in denying them prospective\n\ninjunctive relief.     We review denials of this sort of relief for an\n\nabuse of discretion.       See, e.g., Peaches Entertainment Corp. v.\n\n\n(...continued)\nUniversity School of Law, which he attended instead. The district court\nshould also consider the following paradox: The law school argued strenuously\nthat plaintiff Elliott did not have standing to sue, as he had been offered\nadmission to the schoolSSalbeit at the last momentSSand had failed to accept\nthat offer. The district court found that this offer of admission had not\nbeen communicated to Elliott. 861 F. Supp. at 566. In considering damages,\nhowever, the court held that \"in all likelihood, the plaintiffs would not have\nbeen offered admission even under a constitutionally permissible process.\"\nId. at 581. The district court should re-examine these contradictory results.\n\n                                     57\n\fEntertainment Repertoire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7495\"><a href=\"/opinion/7495/peaches-entertainment-corp-v-entertainment-repertoire-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693 (5th Cir. 1995).                  The\n\nlaw school avers that the district court was well within its\n\nequitable discretion in denying relief, especially as the school\n\nhad abandoned the practices that the district court had found were\n\nunconstitutionalSSto-wit, the use of separate admissions committees\n\nfor whites and minorities.\n\n      We review denials of prospective injunctive relief as we would\n\nany other denial of permanent injunctive relief under FED. R. CIV.\n\nP.   65,   keeping       in   mind,   however,   the   questions   of   mootness,\n\nripeness, and standing.           See generally 11A CHARLES A. WRIGHT     ET AL.,\n\nFEDERAL PRACTICE   AND    PROCEDURE § 2942 (2d ed. 1995).          That treatise\n\nnotes that\n\n      [p]erhaps the most significant single component in the\n      judicial decision whether to exercise equity jurisdiction\n      and grant permanent injunctive relief is the court's\n      discretion. Of course, in some situations the facts and\n      relevant law may indicate that an injunction clearly\n      should be granted or denied. However, in most cases the\n      determination whether to issue an injunction involves a\n      balancing of interests of the parties who might be\n      affected by the court's decision))the hardship on the\n      plaintiff if relief is denied as compared to the\n      defendant if relief is granted and the extent to which\n      the latter hardship can be mitigated by requiring a\n      security bond. Not surprisingly, therefore, the court's\n      decision depends on the circumstances of each case.\n\nId. at 41-42.      Accordingly, the usual practice upon reversal of a\n\ndenial of injunctive relief is to remand for a reweighing of the\n\nequities.    Id. § 2962, at 448;         See, e.g., James v. Stockham Valves\n\n& Fittings Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"347588\"><a href=\"/opinion/347588/15-fair-emplpraccas-827-15-empl-prac-dec-p-7842-patrick-james-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">559</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354-55 (5th Cir. 1977).                   In other\n\nsituations, the appellate court may order the district court to\n\nenter an injunction.           See, e.g., Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.\n\nCity of Mobile, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"302353\"><a href=\"/opinion/302353/southeastern-promotions-ltd-v-city-of-mobile-alabama-a-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1972).\n\n                                          58\n\f     According to the district court, the school had abandoned the\n\nadmissions      procedureSSconsisting        of    the   separate    minority\n\nsubcommitteeSSthat was used in 1992, 1993, and 1994.                The court\n\nreasoned that, as a new procedure was developed for 1995, a\n\nprospective injunction against the school was inappropriate.               We\n\nconclude, however, that, while the district court may have been\n\ncorrect    in    deciding   that    the    new    procedure   eliminates   the\n\nconstitutional flaws that the district court identified in the 1992\n\nsystem, there is no indication that the new system will cure the\n\nadditional constitutional defects we now have explained.\n\n     The new system utilizes a small \"administrative admissions\n\ngroup\" and does not use presumptive admission and denial scores.\n\nSee Hopwood, 861 F. Supp. at 582 n.87.            Most significantly, there\n\nis no indication that in employing the new plan, the law school\n\nwill cease to consider race per se in making its admissions\n\ndecisions.      To the contrary, as the district court recognized, the\n\nlaw school continues to assert that overt racial preferences are\n\nnecessary to the attainment of its goals. See Hopwood, 861 F. Supp.\n\nat 573-75.\n\n     The district court has already granted some equitable relief:\n\nIt directed that the plaintiffs be permitted to re-apply to the law\n\nschool    without    incurring     further    administrative     costs.     In\n\naccordance with this opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to apply\n\nunder a system of admissions that will not discriminate against\n\nanyone on the basis of race.        Moreover, the plaintiffs have shown\n\nthat it is likely that the law school will continue to take race\n\n\n                                      59\n\finto account in admissions unless it receives further judicial\n\ninstruction to the effect that it may not do so for the purpose of\n\n(1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2) altering the school's\n\nreputation in the community; (3) combating the school's perceived\n\nhostile environment toward minorities; or (4) remedying the present\n\neffects of past discrimination by actors other than the law school.\n\n      It is not necessary, however, for us to order at this time\n\nthat the law school be enjoined, as we are confident that the\n\nconscientious       administration      at     the       school,    as    well   as   its\n\nattorneys, will heed the directives contained in this opinion.                         If\n\nan injunction should be needed in the future, the district court,\n\nin   its   discretion,      can     consider       its    parameters      without     our\n\nassistance.       Accordingly, we leave intact that court's refusal to\n\nenter an injunction.\n\n\n\n                                         C.\n\n      The plaintiffs contend that the district court's application\n\nof the wrong standard causes it to deny punitive damages.                             The\n\nplaintiffs aver that the court applied an animus standard, when it\n\nshould     have    asked    whether    the     school       acted     with   \"reckless\n\nindifference\" to their constitutional rights.                         They ask for a\n\nremand on this issue.\n\n      It   is     not   apparent,    from    the     record,       what   standard    the\n\ndistrict court applied in considering the punitive damages issue.\n\nThe court did determine, however, that the law school had always\n\nacted in good faith.        This is a difficult area of the law, in which\n\n\n                                         60\n\fthe law school erred with the best of intentions.   As a result, the\n\nplaintiffs have not met the federal standard for punitive damages\n\nas stated in Smith v. Wade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1983).   Thus, we agree\n\nwith the district court that punitive damages are not warranted.\n\nWe note, however, that if the law school continues to operate a\n\ndisguised or overt racial classification system in the future, its\n\nactors could be subject to actual and punitive damages.\n\n\n\n                                V.\n\n     Consolidated with the appeal of the merits issues of this\n\nappeal is No. 94-50569, challenging the district court's denial of\n\na motion to intervene.     The proposed intervenorsSSthe Thurgood\n\nMarshall Legal Society and the Black Pre-Law Association (the\n\n\"associations\")SSask this court, for the second time, for the right\n\nto intervene.   On their first attempt, the associations moved to\n\nintervene prior to trial either as of right or by permission.   The\n\ndistrict court denied intervention, and we affirmed.    See Hopwood\n\nv. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6427\"><a href=\"/opinion/6427/hopwood-v-state-of-tex/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (\"Hopwood I\").\n\n     Now, following the trial, the associations believe they can\n\nshow that the law school has failed to assert one of their proposed\n\ndefenses, a circumstance they contend establishes their right to\n\nintervene.   We apply the law of the case doctrine and dismiss No.\n\n94-50569 for want of jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                A.\n\n     The proposed intervenors are black student organizations at\n\n\n                                61\n\fthe University of Texas at Austin and its law school that, just\n\nprior to the trial of the merits appeal, sought to intervene,\n\narguing that the law school would not effectively protect their\n\ninterests in continuing racial preferences at the law school.                        The\n\ndistrict court denied the proposed intervention on the ground that\n\nthe law school and the two associations had the same objective:\n\npreservation of the status quo.\n\n      On expedited appeal, this court affirmed on the ground that\n\nthe associations had failed to show that the law school had an\n\ninterest different from theirs.                 We also commented that the two\n\ngroups had failed to show \"a separate defense of the affirmative\n\naction plan that the State has failed to assert.\"                    Id. at 606.     The\n\npanel   implicitly        considered     and      rejected,     as    one       potential\n\ndivergence of interests, the possibility that the law school would\n\nnot raise a defense based upon the legality of the use of TI scores\n\nunder title VI, as the associations argued that possibility as one\n\nbasis for intervention.\n\n      After    their      first   motion    to     intervene        was   denied,    the\n\nassociations remained involved in the case.                 Throughout the course\n\nof the trial, they acted as amici curiae.                   And, at the close of\n\ntrial but before judgment, the district court intimated that it\n\nwould      allow   them     to    submit        information     for       the    record.\n\nAccordingly, the associations sought to introduce testimonial and\n\ndocumentary evidence supporting their arguments that (1) the TI by\n\nitself was an unlawful basis for admissions decisions under title\n\nVI   and    (2)    that    affirmative      action     at     the    university      was\n\n\n                                           62\n\fconstitutionally required. The plaintiffs opposed the introduction\n\nof evidence on these \"new defenses,\" and the district court agreed.\n\nThe associations were allowed to submit amicus briefs and highlight\n\nevidence that was already in the record but were not allowed to\n\nraise new issues or supplement the record.\n\n     Shortly thereafter, the associations again sought to intervene\n\nunder FED. R. CIV. P. 24(a)(2) (intervention as of right),          claiming\n\nthat the law school had failed to raise their two \"new defenses\"\n\nand, accordingly, that events now showed that that representation\n\ninadequately protected their interests.         They sought to reopen the\n\nrecord to introduce evidence supporting these arguments.\n\n     The district court summarily refused this request. That order\n\nis the focus of this separate appeal, in which the associations\n\npresent only the title VI defense and ask to be allowed to present\n\nsuch evidence only if we do not affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                    B.\n\n     There is no caselaw in this circuit that directly addresses\n\nhow to review successive motions to intervene.58 The parties direct\n\nus to Hodgson v.

These courts, which were examining whether\n\nthe appeal from a successive motion was timely as per the appellate\n\nrequirements, devised the general rule that a second motion would\n\nbe treated as independent of the first if it was reached under\n\nmaterially changed circumstances.\n\n     Here, the associations assume that their second intervention\n\nmotion is separate and distinct from their earlier failed attempt,\n\nbecause the law school's failure to raise their proposed defense\n\nconstitutes a changed circumstance.59 Thus, they ask that we engage\n\nin de novo review of their motion.\n\n     The plaintiffs, however, note that this motion was entitled a\n\n\"renewed motion for intervention.\"         The plaintiffs argue that the\n\ndistrict court was reconsidering its previous denial order under\n\n\n     59\n        The associations ground this argument in language taken from the\nprior appeal. One necessary element for intervention is a showing that the\npresent parties will inadequately represent the proposed intervenors'\ninterests. While the associations lost on this ground on the last appeal,\nthey now claim that the opinion supports the argument that the law school's\ndefense is inadequate. In the last appeal, we cited Jansen v. City of\nCincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542342\"><a href=\"/opinion/542342/timothy-jansen-cross-appellants-v-city-of-cincinnati-v-tilford/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1990), as support for the following statement: \"Nor have\nthe proposed intervenors shown that they have a separate defense of the\naffirmative action plan that the State has failed to assert.\" Hopwood I, 21\nF.3d at 606. Because the law school, now after trial, still has not asserted\nthe associations' title VI defense, the associations maintain that they now\ncan meet their burden.\n      In Jansen, however, the court found that the proposed intervenors had an\ninterest different from that of the defendant city. 904 F.2d at 343. This\nwas the basis for that court's holding that the city's representation was\ninadequate. See id. (\"Proffering this alleged violation of the consent decree\nas an affirmative defense is directly counter to the City's interest.\")\n(emphasis added). Here, we have already found that the law school's and the\nassociations' interests are the same. Jansen therefore does not support\nintervention.\n\n                                     64\n\fits FED. R. CIV.

Instead, the \"law of the case\" doctrine militates against\n\nreconsideration of this motion.            Normally, when a prior panel\n\ndiscusses an issue on the merits, a later panel cannot reach a\n\ncontrary conclusion under the preclusive principle of law of the\n\ncase.   See Williams v.

There is no question that the Hopwood I             panel\n\naddressed the intervention as a matter of right de novo, on the\n\nmerits, including the potential that the law school would not raise\n\nevery defense proposed by the associations.\n\n     The question of whether we can rely upon the law of the case\n\ndoctrine, however, is clouded because of the \"anomalous\" rule that\n\nexists in this circuit concerning the procedural posture of these\n\nintervention cases.       Under that rule, we have only provisional\n\njurisdiction to review a district court's denial of a motion to\n\nintervene.\n\n     If    we   agree   with   the   district   court,   our   jurisdiction\n\n\"evaporates.\"     Hence, the denial of leave to intervene when the\n\nparty had a right to intervene is immediately appealable.                On\n\nappeal, however, our rule \"requires a merit review of any claim of\n\nintervention in order for [us] to determine whether or not the\n\n\n                                      65\n\fdistrict court's order is appealable.\"            Weiser v.

If the claim is without merit, then the\n\norder \"is not appealable, the appellate court has no jurisdiction,\n\nand the appeal should be dismissed.\"        Id.    Thus, despite the merits\n\nreview, this is a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.60\n\n      Our anomalous rule complicates the analysis of the preclusive\n\neffects of the prior panel decision, because dismissals for lack of\n\njurisdiction normally do not have preclusive effect.              See, e.g.,\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 41(b).     Accordingly, while appellate courts review\n\ndenials of intervention motions on the merits, it is uncertain to\n\nwhat extent such a review has preclusive effect.            Nonetheless, we\n\nrecognize the possibility of issue preclusion on the question of\n\njurisdiction itself.\n\n      While a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not operate as\n\nan adjudication on the merits, \"[t]his provision means only that\n\nthe dismissal permits a second action on the same claim that\n\ncorrects the deficiency found in the first action.              The judgment\n\nremains effective to preclude relitigation of the precise issue of\n\njurisdiction or venue that led to the initial dismissal.\"            7C WRIGHT\n\n\n\n      60\n        At least one set of commentators has eschewed this traditional rule.\nTheir position is that \"[a]ny denial of intervention should be regarded as an\nappealable final order.\" 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, § 1923, at 508. Under this\nproposed rule, the federal court would \"affirm denial of intervention when\npreviously, having determined on the merits that the trial court was right, it\nwould dismiss the appeal.\" Id. at 509. We have acknowledged that this would\nbe the better rule. See Korioth v.

In fact, the Hopwood I panel affirmed\nrather than dismissing for want of jurisdiction. Under the suggested rule,\nbecause we would have a final order on the merits from a previous panel on\nthis issue, this case would probably be at an end. Nonetheless, as the\nanomalous rule constitutes our circuit caselaw, we are bound to follow it.\n\n\n                                      66\n\fET AL.,    supra, § 4436, at 338.61     Thus, a party is precluded from\n\nsuccessively appealing the same intervention motion.\n\n      Here, the record shows that the associations raised this same\n\ntitle VI argument before the Hopwood I panel in both their brief\n\nand at oral argument.      That panel, reviewing de novo the merits of\n\nthe associations' claims, denied intervention.             Accordingly, the\n\nlast panel implicitly addressed this issue, and we must respect its\n\ndecision to deny intervention.             The law of the case doctrine\n\nprevents merits review, and we dismiss No. 94-50569 for want of\n\njurisdiction.62\n\n\n\n                                     VI.\n\n      In summary, we hold that the University of Texas School of Law\n\n\n      61\n        A dismissal for want of jurisdiction, however, leaves open the\npossibility that the deficiency can be cured. If that occurs, no issue\npreclusion\nexists. See 7C WRIGHT ET AL., supra, § 4436, at 338. It is at this point in the\nanalysis that \"changed circumstances\" may become relevant. Arguably, the\n\"changed circumstances\" analysis, in effect, \"cures\" the earlier\njurisdictional deficiency. Thus, if the circumstances of the case change to\nsuch an extent that jurisdiction would lie, the subsequent motion to intervene\nshould not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In effect, the posture of\nthe case has changed, as it would any time a given jurisdictional problem is\ncured.\n      62\n         In Hopwood I, we decided that (1) the interests of the associations\nwere adequately represented by the law school and the state, and (2) as a\npractical matter, disposition in the principal suit would not impair or impede\neither of those groups' interests. 21 F.3d at 605. The law of the case\ndoctrine militates against revisiting that decision here.\n      For purposes of any future litigation, however, we note a necessary\neffect of our previous holding when coupled with the law school's failure to\nraise a title VI argument: Neither the district court's decision nor ours in\nthis appeal is binding on the associations as res judicata, law of the case,\ncollateral estoppel, or any other theoretical bar.\n      In short, as the title VI issue has not been litigated, the associations\nare not precluded from instituting a separate and independent title VI\nchallenge to the law school's use of the TI. We neither express nor imply an\nopinion on the viability of such a challenge.\n\n                                      67\n\fmay not use race as a factor in deciding which applicants to admit\n\nin order to achieve a diverse student body, to combat the perceived\n\neffects of a hostile environment at the law school, to alleviate\n\nthe law school's poor reputation in the minority community, or to\n\neliminate any present effects of past discrimination by actors\n\nother than the law school.            Because the law school has proffered\n\nthese justifications          for   its    use   of    race   in   admissions,     the\n\nplaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing that they were\n\nscrutinized under an unconstitutional admissions system.                           The\n\nplaintiffs are entitled to reapply under an admissions system that\n\ninvokes none of these serious constitutional infirmities.                    We also\n\ndirect the district court to reconsider the question of damages,\n\nand we conclude that the proposed intervenors properly were denied\n\nintervention.\n\n       In    No.   94-50569,    the    appeal     is    DISMISSED     for   want   of\n\njurisdiction.

Depending on an applicant's\n\nrace, his request for admission was considered under one of three\n\ndifferent          (and,      as   explained    in    the   panel   opinion,    often\n\ndispositive71) TI admission ranges:                  one for blacks only, a    second\n\nfor Mexican Americans only, and a third for all other races and\n\nnationalities, including non-Mexican Hispanic Americans. In short,\n\neach applicant for admission to the law school was classified by\n\nrace, and his application was treated differently                      according into\n\nwhich of those three               racial classifications it fell.         Thus, the\n\nlaw          school's      1992    admissions        process,   like     all   racial\n\nclassifications by the government, is subject to strict scrutiny.72\n\n\n\n\nC.          STRICT SCRUTINY\n\n            The law school contends that it employs a racially stratified\n\nadmissions process to obtain, inter alia, the educational benefits\n\nof a diverse student body.                Translated into the constitutional\n\nidiom, the law school insists that achieving student body diversity\n\nin a public graduate school is a compelling governmental interest.\n\nThe law school invokes the opinion of Justice Powell in Regents of\n\n\n\n\n      71\n      See Panel .

My fellow panelists thus declare categorically\n\nthat \"any consideration of race or ethnicity by the law school for\n\nthe    purposes    of   achieving    a   diverse    student   body   is   not   a\n\ncompelling interest under the Fourteenth Amendment.\"74\n\n        This conclusion may well be a defensible extension of recent\n\nSupreme Court precedent, an extension which in time may prove to be\n\nthe Court's position.

Panel Opn. at 20, 25, & 26\n(respectively pointing out that (1) Bakke     comprises multiple opinions and\ndivergent analyses, (2) no Justice, other than Justice Powell, discusses\ndiversity, and (3) Bakke is questioned in Adarand). The panel opinion fails to\ndescribe this last problem with precise accuracy. That opinion's expurgated\nversion of the quotation at 26, lines 736-42 makes it appear as though the\nAdarand majority questioned Bakke. In full, the sentence reads \"[the Court's]\nfailure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left\nunresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.\"\nThus, although the Court acknowledges that Bakke et al. left things unresolved,\nI do not read this quotation, (as the panel opinion suggests) as an order to\nthrow out Bakke--bath water, baby, and all.\n      Nevertheless, the fractured nature of Bakke's holding has left more\nquestions than answers in its wake. As observed in the instant panel opinion,\nthere has been \"no [other] indication from the Supreme Court, . . . [whether] the\nstate's interest in diversity [in higher education] constitutes a compelling\njustification for governmental race-based classifications.\"    Panel Opn. at 28.\nI agree that Bakke is the only indication that diversity is a compelling\ninterest. But, unlike the panel opinion, which jettisons Justice Powell's Bakke\nopinion because of its singularity, I find that singularity to be precisely the\nfactor that makes Justice Powell's opinion the most pertinent Supreme Court\nstatement on this issue. Therefore, when and if the Supreme Court addresses\nthis case or its analog, the Court will have no choice but to go with, over,\naround, or through Justice Powell's Bakke opinion. By assuming, as I do, that\ndiversity is a compelling interest, however, these problems are avoided\naltogether.\n\n                                       74\n\fminimal guidance in Adarand,81 the definition and application of the\n\ncompelling interest inquiry seems to be suspended somewhere in the\n\ninterstices    of   constitutional      interpretation.        Until    further\n\nclarification issues from        the Supreme Court defining \"compelling\n\ninterest\" (or telling us how to know one when we see one), I\n\nperceive no \"compelling\" reason to rush in where the Supreme Court\n\nfears — or at least declines — to tread.                   Instead, I would\n\npretermit any attempt at a compelling interest inquiry and accept\n\nJustice O'Connor's invitation to apply the Court's more discernible\n\nand less intrusive \"narrow tailoring\" precedent.82              Thus, for the\n\npurpose of this appeal I assume, without deciding, that diversity\n\nis a compelling interest,83 and proceed to the narrowly tailored\n\n       81\n      Recently, in Adarand the Supreme Court stated that it had \"altered the\n[equal protection] playing field in some important respects.\" 115 S.Ct. at 2118.\nIn her opinion for the majority, however, Justice O'Connor repeatedly emphasizes\nthat Adarand did not drive a stake through the heart of affirmative action.

TEST FOR NARROW TAILORING\n\n           When strictly scrutinizing a racial classification for narrow\n\ntailoring, the first question is \"What is the purpose of this\n\nracial classification?\"84              The present effects rationale having\n\nproven feckless in this case, today’s answer to that first question\n\nis a given: The law school's purpose is diversity.                Accordingly, I\n\nperceive the next question to be, \"Was the law school's 1992\n\nadmissions process, with one TI range for blacks, another for\n\nMexican Americans, and a third for other races, narrowly tailored\n\nto achieve diversity?\"           I conclude that it was not.       Focusing as it\n\ndoes on blacks and Mexican Americans only, the law school's 1992\n\nadmissions process misconceived the concept of diversity, as did\n\nCalifornia's         in   the   view   of   Justice   Powell:    Diversity   which\n\nfurthers a compelling state interest \"encompasses a far broader\n\n\n\n(...continued)\neducation context and implicates the uneasy marriage of the First and Fourteenth\nAmendments.   See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 311-12.    Consequently, we play with fire\nwhen we assume an easy crossover of Fourteenth Amendment maxims pronounced in\ncases decided in such other contexts.\n\n      The panel opinion concludes that this contextual distinction is\nunimportant, holding that, whatever the context, remedying the past effects of\ndiscrimination is the only compelling interest that can justify a racial\nclassification. Panel Opn. at 26-29. That opinion acknowledges, however, that\nSupreme Court precedent does not go this far: namely, the higher education\ncontext is different. Indeed the panel opinion quotes Justice O'Connor's words\nexpressly stating that higher education is different. Panel Opn. at 28 n.27\n(quoting Wygant v.

Yet blacks and\n\nMexican Americans are but two among any number of racial or ethnic\n\ngroups that could and presumably should contribute to genuine\n\ndiversity.     By singling out only those two ethnic groups,                 the\n\ninitial stage of the law school's 1992 admissions process ignored\n\naltogether non-Mexican Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and\n\nNative Americans, to name but a few.\n\n      In this light, the limited racial effects of the law school's\n\npreferential admissions process, targeting exclusively blacks and\n\n\n  85\n     Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316. In the portion of his opinion that addresses narrow\ntailoring, Justice Powell concluded that California's admission process\nmisconceived the concept of \"diversity.\" Id. California's preferential program,\nfocused as it was solely on aiding black applicants, was not necessary to attain\ndiversity. Id.\n    86\n       In the instant litigation, the law school created its own Catch-22 by\nadvancing two putative compelling interests that ultimately proved to produce so\nmuch internal tension as to damage if not fatally wound each other. Under the\nbanner of prior discrimination, Texas had no choice but to single out blacks and\nMexican-Americans, for those two racial groups were the only ones of which there\nis any evidence whatsoever of de facto or de jure racial discrimination by the\nState of Texas in the history of its educational system. But, by favoring just\nthose two groups and doing so with a virtual quota system for affirmative action\nin admissions, the law school estops itself from proving that its plan to achieve\ndiversity is ingenuous, much less narrowly tailored.\n\n                                       77\n\fMexican Americans, more closely resembles a set aside or quota\n\nsystem for those two disadvantaged minorities than it does an\n\nacademic admissions program narrowly tailored to achieve true\n\ndiversity. I concede that the law school's 1992 admissions process\n\nwould increase the percentages of black faces and brown faces in\n\nthat year’s entering class.                     But facial diversity is not true\n\ndiversity, and a system thus conceived and implemented simply is\n\nnot narrowly tailored to achieve diversity.\n\n           Accordingly,        I would find that the law school's race-based\n\n1992 admissions process was not narrowly tailored to achieve\n\ndiversity and hold it constitutionally invalid on that basis.                        By\n\nso        doing    I   would   avoid    the     largely   uncharted   waters   of    a\n\ncompelling interest analysis. Although I join my colleagues of the\n\npanel in their holding that the law school's 1992 admissions\n\nprocess           fails   to   pass    strict    scrutiny,87   on   the   question   of\n\ndiversity I follow the solitary path of narrow tailoring rather\n\nthan the primrose path of compelling interest to reach our common\n\nholding.\n\n\n\n                                                II\n\n                                           REMEDY\n\n           Before concluding, I am compelled to add a few words about the\n\npanel opinion’s “commentary” regarding the remedy to be imposed by\n\nthe district court on remand.                        Without employing the express\n\n\n     87\n      I also concur in my colleagues' conclusion that intervention by the two\nblack student organizations is not mandated, and do so for the same reasons.\n\n                                                78\n\flanguage of injunction or affixing that label to its holding, the\n\npanel opinion’s discussion of the remedy on remand is              “strongly\n\nsuggestive”      and   has    all   of   the   substantive   earmarks   of   an\n\ninjunction:\n\n        [The] plaintiffs have shown that it is likely that the\n        law school will continue to take race into account in\n        admissions   unless   it  receives   further   judicial\n        instruction to the effect that it may not do so for the\n        purpose of (1) obtaining a diverse student body; (2)\n        altering the school's reputation in the community; (3)\n        combating the school's perceived hostile environment\n        toward minorities; or (4) remedying the present effects\n        of past discrimination by actors other than the law\n        school.\n             It is not necessary, however, for us to order at\n        this time that the law school be enjoined, as we are\n        confident that the conscientious administration at the\n        school, as well as its attorneys, will heed the\n        directives contained in this opinion. If an injunction\n        should be needed in the future, the district court, in\n        its discretion, can consider its parameters without our\n        assistance. Accordingly, we leave intact that court's\n        refusal to enter an injunction.88\n\nEssentially, the substance of             the quoted portion of the panel\n\nopinion constitutes a de facto injunction — telling the district\n\ncourt precisely what to tell the law school that it can and can't\n\ndo — albeit without the use of the word injunction.               To me,     if\n\n“it” has feathers, swims, waddles, and quacks like a duck, it is a\n\nduck; and I find such an “un-injunction” inappropriate. If instead\n\nwe were simply to reverse and remand on the violation issue, we\n\nwould stop short of finding de novo that the law school had\n\nviolated these four plaintiffs’ equal protection rights.            It seems\n\nunavoidable to me that until the district court determines that\n\nthere has been a violation, a              remedy cannot be fashioned and\n\n  88\n       Panel Opn. at 59-60.\n\n                                         79\n\fshould not be the subject of appellate speculation.89\n\n            The district court denied the plaintiffs injunctive relief,\n\nbut only after assigning the burden of proof to the wrong party.90\n\n  No member of this panel questions that, in the initial stanza of\n\nthe burden-shifting minuet of            Mt. Healthy Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Doyle,91 the plaintiffs met their burden.                   Once the plaintiffs\n\ndid that, the burden should have shifted to the law school.\n\nInstead, the          district   court   left    it    with    the   plaintiffs      and\n\nconcluded that they had failed to carry the ultimate burden.                         The\n\ndistrict court’s failure to shift the burden to the law school, and\n\nthe         conclusion   of   that   court     which    followed,         were   errors.\n\nAccordingly, like my colleagues of the panel, I would remand the\n\ncase to         the   district   court   with    instructions        to    relieve   the\n\nplaintiffs of the misplaced burden while affording the law school\n\nthe opportunity to prove that the prima facie violation established\n\nby the plaintiffs was essentially harmless.                   But it seems clear to\n\nme that this is where our analysis should end.                       As a result, I\n\ndepart from the “commentary” in the panel opinion regarding the\n\nprecise elements of the remedy to be fashioned by the district\n\ncourt if it should conclude on remand that the law school shall\n\n\n\n   89\n      Hay v.

This is not a class\n\naction;      nothing    is   before    us     here   save   the    claims   of   four\n\nindividual plaintiffs.            These four individual plaintiffs properly\n\nchallenge only the admissions process employed by the law school in\n\n1992 — not the admissions process that was in place and employed in\n\n1995, not the admissions process that is being employed in 1996,\n\nand not the admissions process to be applied in any future years.\n\nIn sum, I would remand, and in the process I                 would take care not\n\nto eviscerate the discretion of the district court with excessive\n\n“commentary” or implicit directions on the precise nature of the\n\nremedy that must ensue.            Rather, my remand would simply instruct\n\nthe district court to apply the correct burden-shifting process\n\narticulated in Mt. Healthy, then see how the law school deals with\n\nit.   That way,    if    the Mt. Healthy application should demonstrate\n\nthe need for a remedy, the district court would be free to fashion\n\nthe appropriate reliefSQincluding injunctive if necessarySQfor those\n\namong the individual plaintiffs whose individual cases warrant it.\n\nFor   this    court    to    do    anything      beyond   that    impresses   me   as\n\noverreaching.      Thus I concur in the judgment of the panel opinion\n\nbut, as to its conclusion on the issue of strict scrutiny and its\n\n\n                                            81\n\fgloss on the order of remand, I disagree for the reasons I have\n\nstated and therefore concur specially.\n\n\n\n\n                               82\n\f</pre>",
