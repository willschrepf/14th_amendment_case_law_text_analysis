In addition to actual damages, Cao sought attorney’s fees on his\n\ncontract claim and exemplary damages on his conversion claim. Before trial, the\n\fcourt granted a take-nothing partial summary judgment with respect to the contract\n\nclaim and the request for attorney’s fees. Finding no evidence to support the\n\nimposition of exemplary damages, the trial court granted a motion for directed\n\nverdict as to exemplary damages. A jury found in favor of Cao on his conversion\n\nclaim and found $39,052 in damages, which was the amount of the check that Cao\n\nalleged was converted. After trial, the court granted a take-nothing judgment n.o.v.,\n\nruling that Leontaritis was not liable for conversion as a matter of law and that Cao\n\nlacked standing to pursue the claim.\n\n      Cao appealed. He raises five issues, contending that the trial court erred by:\n\n(1) granting the defendants’ motion for j.n.o.v. on the standing ground; (2) granting\n\npartial summary judgment as to the breach of implied contract claim; (3) granting\n\npartial summary judgment as to attorney’s fees; (4) refusing to submit a jury\n\nquestion on exemplary damages; and (5) granting the motion for j.n.o.v. as to the\n\nconversion claim against Leontaritis.\n\n      Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                     Background\n\n      Thinh Tieu was an automobile dealer who owned a business called Allstate\n\nMotorcars. For approximately 20 years, he did business with appellant Julian Cao,\n\nwho ran a small automobile dealership called Jaycee Imports to supplement the\n\nsalary he earned as an engineer. Appellee John Leontaritis is also in the car sales\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fbusiness, and he is the sole owner of Global Motorcars of Houston, which he\n\nfounded in 2004.\n\n      Leontaritis met Tieu as he was entering the automobile business, and Tieu\n\nbecame a mentor to him. Leontaritis became successful, and he loaned money to\n\nTieu on many occasions. But after Tieu gave him rubber checks, Leontaritis would\n\nno longer accept a check directly from him for repayment.\n\n      In 2010, an Allstate Motorcars employee negotiated the sale of a 2007\n\nMercedes-Benz S550. For reasons not completely explained by the record, the\n\nsalesman prepared a purchase order showing that the sale was between Jaycee\n\nImports, as seller, and Hien V. Ha, as purchaser. However, at the time neither\n\nJaycee Imports nor Cao owned the specified car. Cao had never met or spoken with\n\nHa.\n\n      Cao testified that this was not an unusual transaction; he understood that\n\nTieu wanted to run the sale through his dealership in exchange for a $500\n\ncommission. To that end, Tieu gave Cao a check for $43,255 from Chartway\n\nCredit Union, which ostensibly had provided the financing to Ha.\n\n      According to Cao, Tieu told him to “deduct the amount of tax, title and\n\nlicense, which [amounted] to about $4,200” and to deduct $500 for his fee. Cao\n\ntestified that Tieu told him to write a check to Global Motorcars, which Cao\n\nunderstood to have been the dealership which held the title to the car. Cao gave\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fTieu a check to Global Motorcars for $39,052. On the memo line, Cao wrote\n\n“07S550” and the vehicle identification number of the car described in the\n\npurchase order. He did not give Tieu any instructions pertaining to the check to\n\nGlobal Motorcars except to tell him to get the title. He did not tell Tieu to hold the\n\ncheck until he got the title or to require Global Motorcars to segregate the funds\n\ninto a separate account. At the time he wrote the check, Cao had no contact with\n\nGlobal Motorcars or Leontaritis about the transaction. At trial, it was undisputed\n\nthat Global Motorcars had not offered to sell the specific car to anyone. Relying on\n\nTieu’s representations, Cao did no research and did not determine who owned the\n\ncar he was purporting to sell.\n\n      Neither Global Motorcars nor Leontaritis ever owned or possessed the 2007\n\nMercedes-Benz S550 referenced on Cao’s check. Rather, Tieu said he had\n\npurchased the car from a dealership in Dallas, and he had physical possession of it\n\nat the time Cao wrote the check to Global Motorcars.\n\n      Tieu testified by deposition that before selling the car to Ha, he sold the\n\nsame car to another purchaser. He said he gave the other purchaser the title before\n\nhe received a check for the car. The other purchaser obtained financing from\n\nPremier Financial, spent the money elsewhere, and never returned the title to Tieu\n\nor repaid Premier Financial. Tieu said he forgot that he had given the other\n\npurchaser the title and decided to sell the car again.\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f      Tieu characterized the transaction with Cao as a simple exchange of funds:\n\nCao received a check for $43,252 and gave Tieu a check for $39,052. Tieu testified\n\nthat Leontaritis had agreed to cash the check from Jaycee Imports. He also testified\n\nthat Cao did not give him any instructions about segregating the check or the\n\nproceeds thereof. Contrary to Cao’s contentions, Tieu said that he did not tell Cao\n\nthat Global Motorcars had the title. According to Tieu, Cao could not have\n\nexpected Global Motorcars to give him a title to the car because he had not\n\ncontacted Global Motorcars.\n\n      Tieu took the check to Leontaritis, who testified that he accepted the check\n\nas partial repayment of a loan he had made to Tieu. (Tieu testified that Leontaritis\n\ngave him cash in exchange for the check, and he used the money to purchase a\n\nBentley.) Leontaritis gave the check to his comptroller, who deposited it into the\n\ncompany account in late March 2010. Leontaritis did not put any of the money in\n\nhis personal account. He did not ask about the notes on the memo line of the check,\n\nnor did he otherwise contact Cao about it. Tieu did not give Leontaritis any\n\ninstructions regarding the check. Leontaritis testified that Tieu did not tell him that\n\nhe had to provide a title in exchange for the check, and he said, “Actually, if I\n\nthought that, I would not have taken it.” With respect to his willingness to accept\n\nthe Jaycee Imports check, Leontaritis said that Tieu’s checks from Allstate had\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fbeen bouncing, and he said, “As long as it wasn’t from Allstate, I didn’t care. It\n\nwas to pay me the money that he owed me.”\n\n      When Cao did not receive the title to the car, he asked Tieu why there was a\n\ndelay. Cao testified that Tieu told him that Global Motorcars could not find the title\n\nand needed to get a duplicate. Cao said, “I just believed that the title was lost and I\n\nwas waiting to get the duplicate title to be brought back to me.” He also contacted\n\nthe credit union and alerted it that there was an issue with the title to the car. But he\n\ndid not contact Global Motorcars.\n\n      In May, Cao saw the car on Tieu’s lot, and Tieu told him that he got the car\n\nback because there was a problem with the title. A few days later, the car was\n\nrepossessed by Premier Financing, the lien holder on the car. Tieu testified that he\n\ntold Cao to call Premier Financing to obtain the title to the car.\n\n      After the car was repossessed, Cao became concerned that he owed\n\nChartway Credit Union a refund of the original check. Although he acknowledged\n\nthat he was not an employee, officer, or director of Chartway, he explained: “My\n\nconcern was to try to get back the money so I can return that money to [the] credit\n\nunion.” He also said:\n\n      My whole intention to file this lawsuit is to make sure that the money\n      returned to the right owner; and in this case the right owner is the\n      credit union who paid $43,000 for a car that does not have title. And\n      my whole intention is [to] try to get the money back so I can return\n      that money to [the] credit union because I know now that the title\n      cannot be produced.\n\n                                           6\n\fHe stated that he owed Chartway approximately $43,000, and he planned to return\n\nthe money. He testified that the $39,052 check given to Jaycee Imports represented\n\nChartway’s money, saying: “I never said it was my money.” However, he did not\n\nrepay any of Chartway’s money, including the $4,200 that he had retained for tax,\n\ntitle, and license.\n\n       In August 2010, Cao sent a demand letter to Global Motorcars for $39,052,\n\nalleging that the check was transmitted to be exchanged for the title to the\n\nreferenced vehicle and that Global Motorcars deposited the check but failed to\n\nprovide the title to the car. This was Cao’s first personal contact with Global\n\nMotorcars about the transaction. Global Motorcars responded that it had never\n\nowned the referenced vehicle, and it demanded that Cao identify the salesperson\n\nwith whom he spoke and the date of the negotiation of the alleged purchase. In\n\naddition, the letter acknowledged receipt and deposit of the check, but it stated that\n\nTieu had represented that the check was for the purpose of partially repaying a\n\npersonal loan. The letter also stated, “Importantly, neither your client nor Mr. Tieu\n\ninformed Global that the check [was] intended to be payment for a vehicle that was\n\nnot in Global’s possession. Thus, it appears that your client should seek any\n\nrecovery, if any is allowed, from Mr. Tieu.”\n\n       Cao sued Global Motorcars and Leontaritis for breach of an implied contract\n\nand conversion. He also sought recovery of attorney’s fees. Global Motorcars and\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fLeontaritis moved for partial summary judgment arguing that Cao could not\n\nestablish breach of an implied contract and that he had conceded that his claim for\n\nattorney’s fees was meritless in response to special exceptions. As summary-\n\njudgment evidence, the defendants attached the second amended petition, response\n\nto special exceptions, and an affidavit from Leontaritis.\n\n      In response Cao argued that the $39,052 check with the VIN number noted\n\non the memo line was an offer to purchase that vehicle and that the offer was\n\naccepted when Global Motorcars deposited the check. As for attorney’s fees, Cao\n\nargued that attorney’s fees are recoverable for conversion when founded upon a\n\nwritten contract.\n\n      The trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment, dismissing\n\nwith prejudice the claims for breach of an implied contract and recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees. The case went to trial on Cao’s theory of conversion. At the time of\n\ntrial, Chartway had not sued Cao or Jaycee Imports in connection with this\n\ntransaction. There is no evidence in the record that Chartway had even made a\n\ndemand on Cao or Jaycee Imports. Likewise, there is no indication that Ha had\n\nmade any demand or filed any lawsuit against Cao or Jaycee Motors. Neither\n\nChartway nor Ha were parties to this case. Furthermore, Cao conceded he had not\n\nlost any money on account of this transaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      The jury found: (1) the check was personal property as defined by the\n\ncharge, (2) both Global Motorcars and Leontaritis were liable for conversion of the\n\ncheck, (3) neither Global Motorcars nor Leontaritis was a holder in due course, and\n\n(4) the parties’ responsibility for the conversion was assigned as 10% to Tieu, 40%\n\nto Gobal Motorcars, and 60% to Leontaritis.\n\n      The defendants filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,\n\nchallenging Cao’s standing and arguing that there was no evidence to support the\n\nconversion claim. The court granted the motion for j.n.o.v. on both grounds. Cao\n\nfiled a motion for new trial challenging the j.n.o.v., the trial court denied the\n\nmotion. Cao appealed.\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n   I. Implied contract\n\n      In his second issue, Cao argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on his breach of implied contract claim.\n\n      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d\n\n844, 848 (Tex. 2009). The party moving for traditional summary judgment bears\n\nthe burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see also Provident\n\nLife & Accident Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215–16 (Tex. 2003). A\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fdefendant moving for summary judgment must conclusively negate at least one\n\nessential element of each of the plaintiff’s causes of action or conclusively\n\nestablish each element of an affirmative defense. Sci. Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez,\n\n941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex. 1997).\n\n      “The elements of a contract, express or implied, are identical.” Plotkin v.\n\nJoekel, 304 S.W.3d 455, 476 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied).\n\nThese elements are an offer, an acceptance, a meeting of the minds, each party’s\n\nconsent to the terms, and execution and delivery of the contract with the intent that\n\nit be mutually binding. Id. While an express contract arises when contractual terms\n\nare stated by the parties, an implied-in-fact contract arises from the acts and\n\nconduct of the parties. Haws & Garrett Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Gorbett Bros.\n\nWelding Co., 480 S.W.2d 607, 609 (Tex. 1972). When a party sues on an implied\n\ncontract, the element of mutual assent is a question of fact to be determined by the\n\nfact finder. Id. at 609–10. While mutual assent can be shown from the conduct of\n\nthe parties, the conduct must be intentional and the actor must know or have reason\n\nto know that the other party will infer his assent from his conduct. Id. at 609.\n\n      The defendants filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat the factual allegations in Cao’s pleading negated elements of his breach of\n\nimplied contract cause of action. Specifically, the defendants relied on the\n\nfollowing allegations:\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      JAYCEE is a car dealer in Houston, Texas. Tim Tieu (“TIEU”) of\n      Allstate Motorcars, also a car dealer in Houston, requested that\n      JAYCEE assist him in facilitating a sales transaction of a 2007\n      Mercedes Model S550 . . . (“the vehicle”) that he had sold . . . .\n\n      ....\n\n      JAYCEE specifically wrote the check for the vehicle because he was\n      told GLOBAL had possession of the title and subsequently he\n      discovered that GLOBAL never had title. GLOBAL has admitted that\n      it accepted the check as payment for a personal debt between TIEU\n      and GLOBAL and/or LEONTARITIS.\n\nThe defendants argued that Cao could not prove offer and acceptance, which are\n\nelements of an implied contract, because his petition alleged that the agreement\n\nwas between Jaycee Imports and Tieu, and thus did not involve either defendant.\n\nThey also argue that the petition negates the “mutual intent to contract” element of\n\nan implied contract because it alleges that Global Motorcars accepted the check as\n\npayment for a personal debt. That is, although there is evidence that Global\n\nMotorcars accepted the check, such action does not satisfy the element of mutual\n\nassent to contract.\n\n      The defendants attached Cao’s second amended petition, his response to the\n\ndefendants’ special exceptions and motion to dismiss, and an affidavit from\n\nLeontaritis. In the affidavit, Leontaritis averred that he never owned the 2007\n\nMercedes-Benz S550 and that the check he received from Tieu was solely for\n\nrepayment of a personal debt. He also averred, “I have not routinely done business\n\nwith Jaycee Imports in the past and did not intend to do business with Mr. Cao or\n\n                                        11\n\fJaycee Imports when accepting the check from Tim Tieu.” Because Leontaritis’s\n\naffidavit conclusively negated the element of assent, the burden shifted to Cao to\n\nproduce some evidence that Leontaritis or Global Motorcars assented to the alleged\n\nimplied contract.\n\n      In response to the motion for summary judgment, Cao provided an affidavit,\n\nin which he averred that he made an offer to purchase the car by tendering a check\n\nto Leontaritis and Global Motorcars with the vehicle notation on the front:\n\n      I made an offer on March 22, 2010 to Defendants for the purchase of\n      a 2007 Mercedes S550 . . . (“the vehicle”) when my check was\n      tendered for payment of the same. The check, with the vehicle\n      notation on the front, is the way I have conducted business for twenty\n      (20) years as attached as Exhibit A. I expected a title in return for my\n      check.\n\nHe further averred that Leontaritis and Global Motorcars deposited the check on\n\nMarch 24, 2010 without delivering title. However, nowhere in his affidavit did Cao\n\naver that it was a customary practice in the automobile business for a purchaser to\n\noffer to buy a vehicle solely by tendering a check bearing a vehicle identification\n\nnumber and without any other communication. Nor did he aver that it was equally\n\ncustomary in the automobile business for the acceptance of such a check to\n\nconstitute acceptance of an offer to purchase a vehicle identified by such a\n\nnotation.\n\n      Nevertheless, in his response to the motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nCao argued that “Defendants accepted their offer by their deposit of the check.” He\n\n                                         12\n\falso argued that the practice of noting the vehicle model and identification number\n\non the front of the check was “the customary business practice of Plaintiff and\n\nindustry standard.” It is well-settled that a pleading, including a response to a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, is not evidence that a court may consider in ruling\n\non a motion for summary judgment. Thus Cao’s arguments are not summary-\n\njudgment evidence. See Laidlaw Waste Sys. (Dallas), Inc. v. City of Wilmer, 904\n\nS.W.2d 656, 660–61 (Tex. 1995); Adams v. Downey, 124 S.W.3d 769, 773 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (citing Madeksho v. Abraham, Watkins,\n\nNichols & Friend, 57 S.W.3d 448, 455 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001,\n\npet. denied)).\n\n      The defendants conclusively negated the element of mutual assent to\n\ncontract, and Cao’s summary-judgment evidence failed to raise a fact question as\n\nto whether Leontaritis and Cao intended to enter into a contract for the sale of the\n\nsubject vehicle. Because Cao failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nthe negated issue, we conclude that the defendants were entitled to summary\n\njudgment, and we hold that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment and\n\ndismissed the breach of implied contract claim. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Sci.\n\nSpectrum, Inc., 941 S.W.2d at 911. We overrule Cao’s second issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f   II. Attorney’s fees\n\n      The defendants’ motion for summary judgment also argued that Cao had no\n\nbasis in law for his claim of entitlement to attorney’s fees. The defendants filed a\n\nspecial exception to the petition, and Cao responded by amending his petition to\n\nomit references to Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 38.001. However,\n\nCao continued to assert a claim for attorney’s fees under the causes of action as\n\npleaded.\n\n      Texas follows the American Rule, which provides that there can be no\n\nrecovery of attorney’s fees unless authorized by contract or statute. In re Nalle\n\nPlastics Family Ltd. P’ship, 406 S.W.3d 168, 172 (Tex. 2013) (citing Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 310–11 (Tex. 2006)). As a general rule,\n\nattorney’s fees are not recoverable in a conversion case, however an exception\n\nexists and such fees may be recoverable when a conversion case is founded on a\n\ncontract. F.D.I.C. v. Golden Imports, Inc., 859 S.W.2d 635, 646–47 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ). In addition, section 38.001 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code provides for the recovery of “reasonable attorney’s\n\nfees . . . if the claim is for . . . an oral or written contract.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 38.001 (West 2008). Cao’s live pleading omitted any reference to\n\nsection 38.001, and he does not rely on this statute on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\f      Cao argues that attorney’s fees are recoverable because his conversion claim\n\nis founded upon a contract. However, there is neither allegation nor proof of a\n\nwritten contract in this case, and we have held that the trial court correctly granted\n\nthe motion for summary judgment because the defendants negated the existence of\n\nan implied-in-fact contract. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no legal basis\n\nfor an award of attorney’s fees in this case, and we hold that the trial court\n\ncorrectly granted the motion for summary judgment by dismissing Cao’s claim for\n\nattorney’s fees.\n\n   III.   Standing\n\n      In his first issue, Cao argues that the trial court erred by granting judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict on the ground that he lacked standing to pursue a cause\n\nof action for conversion.\n\n      We review a trial court’s judgment notwithstanding the verdict under a no-\n\nevidence standard, and we will uphold the jury’s finding if more than a scintilla of\n\ncompetent evidence supports it. Tanner v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 289\n\nS.W.3d 828, 830 (Tex. 2009); City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 823 (Tex.\n\n2005). To merit the trial court’s j.n.o.v., the defendants were required to\n\ndemonstrate that the evidence conclusively showed that Cao lacked standing. In a\n\ncase such as this one, in which the question of standing was raised after trial, we\n\nconstrue the petition in the plaintiff’s favor, and we may review the entire record to\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\fdetermine if any evidence supports standing. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control\n\nBd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993).\n\n      Standing requires that the parties have a real controversy which can actually\n\nbe determined by the relief sought. Id. If a party lacks standing, a trial court lacks\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction to hear the case. Austin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Lovato, 171\n\nS.W.3d 845, 849 (Tex. 2005). A person has standing to appeal when he is\n\npersonally aggrieved by the alleged wrong. Nootsie, Ltd. v. Williamson Cnty.\n\nAppraisal Dist., 925 S.W.2d 659, 661 (Tex. 1996). To demonstrate standing, a\n\n“plaintiff must affirmatively show, through pleadings and other evidence pertinent\n\nto the jurisdictional inquiry, a distinct interest in the asserted conflict, such that the\n\ndefendant’s actions have caused the plaintiff some particular injury.” Alpert v.\n\nRiley, 274 S.W.3d 277, 291 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied)\n\n(citing Hunt v. Bass, 664 S.W.2d 323, 324 (Tex. 1984)). In addition, the\n\ncomplained-of injury “must be concrete and particularized, actual or imminent, not\n\nhypothetical.” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Inman, 252 S.W.3d 299, 304–05 (Tex.\n\n2008) (footnotes omitted).\n\n      Closely related to standing, and also implicating a court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction, is the concept of ripeness. Ramon v. Teacher Retirement Sys. of Tex.,\n\nNo. 01-09-00684-CV, 2010 WL 1241293, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2010, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (citing Patterson v. Planned Parenthood of Houston,\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f971 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1998). A claim is ripe when the complained-of injury\n\nhas occurred or is likely to occur. Id. “If the injury is only likely to occur, the\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the injury is imminent, direct, and immediate, and\n\nnot merely remote, conjectural, or hypothetical.” Id. (citing Waco Indep. Sch. Dist.\n\nv. Gibson, 22 S.W.3d 849, 852 (Tex. 2000)). “A case is not ripe when determining\n\nwhether the plaintiff has a concrete injury depends on contingent or hypothetical\n\nfacts, or upon events that have not yet come to pass.” Gibson, 22 S.W.3d at 852.\n\n      On appeal, Global Motorcars and Leontaritis argue that there was no\n\nevidence that Cao suffered a distinct injury because of any action taken by them.\n\nThey argue that Cao was suing in an attempt to recover Chartway’s money, and\n\nthey point out that Chartway had not sued Cao. In his petition, Cao alleged that\n\nGlobal Motorcars and Leontaritis converted the check by depositing it in a Global\n\nMotorcars account and by refusing to return it when demanded. He alleged that the\n\nmoney was accepted as repayment of a debt Tieu owed to Leontaritis and Global\n\nMotorcars.\n\n      Cao argues that he has standing to pursue these claims because he delivered\n\na check to Global Motorcars and received nothing in return. He argues that the sale\n\nof the car is void because he cannot transfer title to Chartway. He further argues\n\nthat he has suffered an injury, that money damages would make him whole and\n\nenable him to refund Chartway’s money, and that the two-year difference in the\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fstatutes of limitation for conversion (2 years) and breach of contract (4 years)\n\nweighs in favor of finding that he has standing.\n\n        At trial Cao conceded that, aside from his legal fees, he had lost no money\n\ndue to this transaction, and he had $4,200 more in his bank account because he had\n\nretained the money set aside for tax, title, license, and commission. As to the\n\n$39,000 that Tieu delivered to Global Motorcars, Cao conceded it was Chartway’s\n\nmoney, not his own, saying, “I never said it was my money.” Cao testified that he\n\nwas suing on behalf of Chartway, although he had no legal right to do so.\n\n        Cao testified that he had no contact or communication with Leontaritis or\n\nGlobal Motorcars before writing the check or entrusting it to Tieu for delivery. He\n\ntestified that the only person who ever offered to sell him the vehicle was Tieu,\n\nupon whom he relied when making the check payable to Global Motorcars. Cao\n\ntestified that Tieu betrayed his trust and defrauded him by failing to bring him title\n\nto the car. Although Cao argues that he had a transaction with Global Motorcars\n\nthat went awry, the record shows that his transaction and agreement were with\n\nTieu.\n\n        Cao also testified that Chartway had not sued him regarding the car or the\n\ncheck. He described a conversation he had with a Chartway loan officer who\n\ninstructed him to “keep working on the title,” and to inform her when he had\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fobtained it. However, the court sustained an objection to this testimony and\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard it.\n\n       Neither Cao’s pleadings nor the evidence adduced at trial show that he\n\nsuffered a distinct injury as a result of the defendants’ actions. He lost no money\n\nand in fact had gained $4,200 as a result of the transaction. He conceded that the\n\nmoney did not belong to him; rather, it belonged to Chartway. But Cao has no\n\nstanding to sue for money that belongs to another party. See Shipley, 331 S.W.3d at\n\n30. In addition, to the extent that it was Tieu, not the defendants, who had\n\ndefrauded Cao, no real controversy exists between Cao and the defendants that can\n\nactually be determined by the relief sought. See Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at\n\n446.\n\n       Cao also argued that, based on the two-year difference between the statutes\n\nof limitation for conversion and breach of contract, he anticipated that Chartway\n\nmight sue him to recover on the check. That hypothetical circumstance, were it to\n\noccur, would not change our analysis that Cao lacks standing to assert a conversion\n\nclaim on behalf of Chartway. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record\n\ndemonstrating that Cao’s professed concerns are likely to be realized. Cao testified\n\nthat Chartway had not sued him. And aside from his stricken testimony that the\n\nloan officer instructed him to continue trying to obtain the title to the car, the\n\nrecord is bereft of evidence as to whether Chartway will take action against Cao to\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\frecover the money that was initially loaned to Ha. The record in this case does not\n\nshow that any action by Chartway has occurred or is likely to occur; there is no\n\nevidence that such an injury was “imminent, direct, and immediate, and not merely\n\nremote, conjectural, or hypothetical.” See Ramon, 2010 WL 1241293, at *4.\n\n      Because Cao has not alleged or demonstrated a concrete, particularized\n\ninjury caused by the defendants’ conduct, we hold that Cao lacks standing to sue\n\nthem for conversion. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted the motion for\n\nj.n.o.v. We overrule Cao’s first issue, and in light of this disposition, we need not\n\naddress Cao’s fourth and fifth issues.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Michael Massengale\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Sharp and Massengale.\n\nJustice Sharp, concurring without opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\f",

In addition to actual damages, Cao sought attorney’s fees on his\n\ncontract claim and exemplary damages on his conversion claim. Before trial, the\n\fcourt granted a take-nothing partial summary judgment with respect to the contract\n\nclaim and the request for attorney’s fees. Finding no evidence to support the\n\nimposition of exemplary damages, the trial court granted a motion for directed\n\nverdict as to exemplary damages. A jury found in favor of Cao on his conversion\n\nclaim and found $39,052 in damages, which was the amount of the check that Cao\n\nalleged was converted. After trial, the court granted a take-nothing judgment n.o.v.,\n\nruling that Leontaritis was not liable for conversion as a matter of law and that Cao\n\nlacked standing to pursue the claim.\n\n      Cao appealed. He raises five issues, contending that the trial court erred by:\n\n(1) granting the defendants’ motion for j.n.o.v. on the standing ground; (2) granting\n\npartial summary judgment as to the breach of implied contract claim; (3) granting\n\npartial summary judgment as to attorney’s fees; (4) refusing to submit a jury\n\nquestion on exemplary damages; and (5) granting the motion for j.n.o.v. as to the\n\nconversion claim against Leontaritis.\n\n      Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                     Background\n\n      Thinh Tieu was an automobile dealer who owned a business called Allstate\n\nMotorcars. For approximately 20 years, he did business with appellant Julian Cao,\n\nwho ran a small automobile dealership called Jaycee Imports to supplement the\n\nsalary he earned as an engineer. Appellee John Leontaritis is also in the car sales\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fbusiness, and he is the sole owner of Global Motorcars of Houston, which he\n\nfounded in 2004.\n\n      Leontaritis met Tieu as he was entering the automobile business, and Tieu\n\nbecame a mentor to him. Leontaritis became successful, and he loaned money to\n\nTieu on many occasions. But after Tieu gave him rubber checks, Leontaritis would\n\nno longer accept a check directly from him for repayment.\n\n      In 2010, an Allstate Motorcars employee negotiated the sale of a 2007\n\nMercedes-Benz S550. For reasons not completely explained by the record, the\n\nsalesman prepared a purchase order showing that the sale was between Jaycee\n\nImports, as seller, and Hien V. Ha, as purchaser. However, at the time neither\n\nJaycee Imports nor Cao owned the specified car. Cao had never met or spoken with\n\nHa.\n\n      Cao testified that this was not an unusual transaction; he understood that\n\nTieu wanted to run the sale through his dealership in exchange for a $500\n\ncommission. To that end, Tieu gave Cao a check for $43,255 from Chartway\n\nCredit Union, which ostensibly had provided the financing to Ha.\n\n      According to Cao, Tieu told him to “deduct the amount of tax, title and\n\nlicense, which [amounted] to about $4,200” and to deduct $500 for his fee. Cao\n\ntestified that Tieu told him to write a check to Global Motorcars, which Cao\n\nunderstood to have been the dealership which held the title to the car. Cao gave\n\n\n\n                                        3\n\fTieu a check to Global Motorcars for $39,052. On the memo line, Cao wrote\n\n“07S550” and the vehicle identification number of the car described in the\n\npurchase order. He did not give Tieu any instructions pertaining to the check to\n\nGlobal Motorcars except to tell him to get the title. He did not tell Tieu to hold the\n\ncheck until he got the title or to require Global Motorcars to segregate the funds\n\ninto a separate account. At the time he wrote the check, Cao had no contact with\n\nGlobal Motorcars or Leontaritis about the transaction. At trial, it was undisputed\n\nthat Global Motorcars had not offered to sell the specific car to anyone. Relying on\n\nTieu’s representations, Cao did no research and did not determine who owned the\n\ncar he was purporting to sell.\n\n      Neither Global Motorcars nor Leontaritis ever owned or possessed the 2007\n\nMercedes-Benz S550 referenced on Cao’s check. Rather, Tieu said he had\n\npurchased the car from a dealership in Dallas, and he had physical possession of it\n\nat the time Cao wrote the check to Global Motorcars.\n\n      Tieu testified by deposition that before selling the car to Ha, he sold the\n\nsame car to another purchaser. He said he gave the other purchaser the title before\n\nhe received a check for the car. The other purchaser obtained financing from\n\nPremier Financial, spent the money elsewhere, and never returned the title to Tieu\n\nor repaid Premier Financial. Tieu said he forgot that he had given the other\n\npurchaser the title and decided to sell the car again.\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f      Tieu characterized the transaction with Cao as a simple exchange of funds:\n\nCao received a check for $43,252 and gave Tieu a check for $39,052. Tieu testified\n\nthat Leontaritis had agreed to cash the check from Jaycee Imports. He also testified\n\nthat Cao did not give him any instructions about segregating the check or the\n\nproceeds thereof. Contrary to Cao’s contentions, Tieu said that he did not tell Cao\n\nthat Global Motorcars had the title. According to Tieu, Cao could not have\n\nexpected Global Motorcars to give him a title to the car because he had not\n\ncontacted Global Motorcars.\n\n      Tieu took the check to Leontaritis, who testified that he accepted the check\n\nas partial repayment of a loan he had made to Tieu. (Tieu testified that Leontaritis\n\ngave him cash in exchange for the check, and he used the money to purchase a\n\nBentley.) Leontaritis gave the check to his comptroller, who deposited it into the\n\ncompany account in late March 2010. Leontaritis did not put any of the money in\n\nhis personal account. He did not ask about the notes on the memo line of the check,\n\nnor did he otherwise contact Cao about it. Tieu did not give Leontaritis any\n\ninstructions regarding the check. Leontaritis testified that Tieu did not tell him that\n\nhe had to provide a title in exchange for the check, and he said, “Actually, if I\n\nthought that, I would not have taken it.” With respect to his willingness to accept\n\nthe Jaycee Imports check, Leontaritis said that Tieu’s checks from Allstate had\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fbeen bouncing, and he said, “As long as it wasn’t from Allstate, I didn’t care. It\n\nwas to pay me the money that he owed me.”\n\n      When Cao did not receive the title to the car, he asked Tieu why there was a\n\ndelay. Cao testified that Tieu told him that Global Motorcars could not find the title\n\nand needed to get a duplicate. Cao said, “I just believed that the title was lost and I\n\nwas waiting to get the duplicate title to be brought back to me.” He also contacted\n\nthe credit union and alerted it that there was an issue with the title to the car. But he\n\ndid not contact Global Motorcars.\n\n      In May, Cao saw the car on Tieu’s lot, and Tieu told him that he got the car\n\nback because there was a problem with the title. A few days later, the car was\n\nrepossessed by Premier Financing, the lien holder on the car. Tieu testified that he\n\ntold Cao to call Premier Financing to obtain the title to the car.\n\n      After the car was repossessed, Cao became concerned that he owed\n\nChartway Credit Union a refund of the original check. Although he acknowledged\n\nthat he was not an employee, officer, or director of Chartway, he explained: “My\n\nconcern was to try to get back the money so I can return that money to [the] credit\n\nunion.” He also said:\n\n      My whole intention to file this lawsuit is to make sure that the money\n      returned to the right owner; and in this case the right owner is the\n      credit union who paid $43,000 for a car that does not have title. And\n      my whole intention is [to] try to get the money back so I can return\n      that money to [the] credit union because I know now that the title\n      cannot be produced.\n\n                                           6\n\fHe stated that he owed Chartway approximately $43,000, and he planned to return\n\nthe money. He testified that the $39,052 check given to Jaycee Imports represented\n\nChartway’s money, saying: “I never said it was my money.” However, he did not\n\nrepay any of Chartway’s money, including the $4,200 that he had retained for tax,\n\ntitle, and license.\n\n       In August 2010, Cao sent a demand letter to Global Motorcars for $39,052,\n\nalleging that the check was transmitted to be exchanged for the title to the\n\nreferenced vehicle and that Global Motorcars deposited the check but failed to\n\nprovide the title to the car. This was Cao’s first personal contact with Global\n\nMotorcars about the transaction. Global Motorcars responded that it had never\n\nowned the referenced vehicle, and it demanded that Cao identify the salesperson\n\nwith whom he spoke and the date of the negotiation of the alleged purchase. In\n\naddition, the letter acknowledged receipt and deposit of the check, but it stated that\n\nTieu had represented that the check was for the purpose of partially repaying a\n\npersonal loan. The letter also stated, “Importantly, neither your client nor Mr. Tieu\n\ninformed Global that the check [was] intended to be payment for a vehicle that was\n\nnot in Global’s possession. Thus, it appears that your client should seek any\n\nrecovery, if any is allowed, from Mr. Tieu.”\n\n       Cao sued Global Motorcars and Leontaritis for breach of an implied contract\n\nand conversion. He also sought recovery of attorney’s fees. Global Motorcars and\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fLeontaritis moved for partial summary judgment arguing that Cao could not\n\nestablish breach of an implied contract and that he had conceded that his claim for\n\nattorney’s fees was meritless in response to special exceptions. As summary-\n\njudgment evidence, the defendants attached the second amended petition, response\n\nto special exceptions, and an affidavit from Leontaritis.\n\n      In response Cao argued that the $39,052 check with the VIN number noted\n\non the memo line was an offer to purchase that vehicle and that the offer was\n\naccepted when Global Motorcars deposited the check. As for attorney’s fees, Cao\n\nargued that attorney’s fees are recoverable for conversion when founded upon a\n\nwritten contract.\n\n      The trial court granted the motion for partial summary judgment, dismissing\n\nwith prejudice the claims for breach of an implied contract and recovery of\n\nattorney’s fees. The case went to trial on Cao’s theory of conversion. At the time of\n\ntrial, Chartway had not sued Cao or Jaycee Imports in connection with this\n\ntransaction. There is no evidence in the record that Chartway had even made a\n\ndemand on Cao or Jaycee Imports. Likewise, there is no indication that Ha had\n\nmade any demand or filed any lawsuit against Cao or Jaycee Motors. Neither\n\nChartway nor Ha were parties to this case. Furthermore, Cao conceded he had not\n\nlost any money on account of this transaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      The jury found: (1) the check was personal property as defined by the\n\ncharge, (2) both Global Motorcars and Leontaritis were liable for conversion of the\n\ncheck, (3) neither Global Motorcars nor Leontaritis was a holder in due course, and\n\n(4) the parties’ responsibility for the conversion was assigned as 10% to Tieu, 40%\n\nto Gobal Motorcars, and 60% to Leontaritis.\n\n      The defendants filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,\n\nchallenging Cao’s standing and arguing that there was no evidence to support the\n\nconversion claim. The court granted the motion for j.n.o.v. on both grounds. Cao\n\nfiled a motion for new trial challenging the j.n.o.v., the trial court denied the\n\nmotion. Cao appealed.\n\n                                     Analysis\n\n   I. Implied contract\n\n      In his second issue, Cao argues that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on his breach of implied contract claim.\n\n      We review de novo the trial court’s ruling on a motion for summary\n\njudgment.

When a party sues on an implied\n\ncontract, the element of mutual assent is a question of fact to be determined by the\n\nfact finder. Id. at 609–10. While mutual assent can be shown from the conduct of\n\nthe parties, the conduct must be intentional and the actor must know or have reason\n\nto know that the other party will infer his assent from his conduct. Id. at 609.\n\n      The defendants filed a traditional motion for summary judgment, arguing\n\nthat the factual allegations in Cao’s pleading negated elements of his breach of\n\nimplied contract cause of action. Specifically, the defendants relied on the\n\nfollowing allegations:\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      JAYCEE is a car dealer in Houston, Texas. Tim Tieu (“TIEU”) of\n      Allstate Motorcars, also a car dealer in Houston, requested that\n      JAYCEE assist him in facilitating a sales transaction of a 2007\n      Mercedes Model S550 . . . (“the vehicle”) that he had sold . . . .\n\n      ....\n\n      JAYCEE specifically wrote the check for the vehicle because he was\n      told GLOBAL had possession of the title and subsequently he\n      discovered that GLOBAL never had title. GLOBAL has admitted that\n      it accepted the check as payment for a personal debt between TIEU\n      and GLOBAL and/or LEONTARITIS.\n\nThe defendants argued that Cao could not prove offer and acceptance, which are\n\nelements of an implied contract, because his petition alleged that the agreement\n\nwas between Jaycee Imports and Tieu, and thus did not involve either defendant.\n\nThey also argue that the petition negates the “mutual intent to contract” element of\n\nan implied contract because it alleges that Global Motorcars accepted the check as\n\npayment for a personal debt. That is, although there is evidence that Global\n\nMotorcars accepted the check, such action does not satisfy the element of mutual\n\nassent to contract.\n\n      The defendants attached Cao’s second amended petition, his response to the\n\ndefendants’ special exceptions and motion to dismiss, and an affidavit from\n\nLeontaritis. In the affidavit, Leontaritis averred that he never owned the 2007\n\nMercedes-Benz S550 and that the check he received from Tieu was solely for\n\nrepayment of a personal debt. He also averred, “I have not routinely done business\n\nwith Jaycee Imports in the past and did not intend to do business with Mr. Cao or\n\n                                        11\n\fJaycee Imports when accepting the check from Tim Tieu.” Because Leontaritis’s\n\naffidavit conclusively negated the element of assent, the burden shifted to Cao to\n\nproduce some evidence that Leontaritis or Global Motorcars assented to the alleged\n\nimplied contract.\n\n      In response to the motion for summary judgment, Cao provided an affidavit,\n\nin which he averred that he made an offer to purchase the car by tendering a check\n\nto Leontaritis and Global Motorcars with the vehicle notation on the front:\n\n      I made an offer on March 22, 2010 to Defendants for the purchase of\n      a 2007 Mercedes S550 . . . (“the vehicle”) when my check was\n      tendered for payment of the same. The check, with the vehicle\n      notation on the front, is the way I have conducted business for twenty\n      (20) years as attached as Exhibit A. I expected a title in return for my\n      check.\n\nHe further averred that Leontaritis and Global Motorcars deposited the check on\n\nMarch 24, 2010 without delivering title. However, nowhere in his affidavit did Cao\n\naver that it was a customary practice in the automobile business for a purchaser to\n\noffer to buy a vehicle solely by tendering a check bearing a vehicle identification\n\nnumber and without any other communication. Nor did he aver that it was equally\n\ncustomary in the automobile business for the acceptance of such a check to\n\nconstitute acceptance of an offer to purchase a vehicle identified by such a\n\nnotation.\n\n      Nevertheless, in his response to the motion for partial summary judgment,\n\nCao argued that “Defendants accepted their offer by their deposit of the check.” He\n\n                                         12\n\falso argued that the practice of noting the vehicle model and identification number\n\non the front of the check was “the customary business practice of Plaintiff and\n\nindustry standard.” It is well-settled that a pleading, including a response to a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, is not evidence that a court may consider in ruling\n\non a motion for summary judgment. Thus Cao’s arguments are not summary-\n\njudgment evidence. See Laidlaw Waste Sys. (Dallas), Inc. v.

Because Cao failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nthe negated issue, we conclude that the defendants were entitled to summary\n\njudgment, and we hold that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment and\n\ndismissed the breach of implied contract claim.

Attorney’s fees\n\n      The defendants’ motion for summary judgment also argued that Cao had no\n\nbasis in law for his claim of entitlement to attorney’s fees. The defendants filed a\n\nspecial exception to the petition, and Cao responded by amending his petition to\n\nomit references to Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 38.001.

However, there is neither allegation nor proof of a\n\nwritten contract in this case, and we have held that the trial court correctly granted\n\nthe motion for summary judgment because the defendants negated the existence of\n\nan implied-in-fact contract.

In his petition, Cao alleged that\n\nGlobal Motorcars and Leontaritis converted the check by depositing it in a Global\n\nMotorcars account and by refusing to return it when demanded. He alleged that the\n\nmoney was accepted as repayment of a debt Tieu owed to Leontaritis and Global\n\nMotorcars.\n\n      Cao argues that he has standing to pursue these claims because he delivered\n\na check to Global Motorcars and received nothing in return. He argues that the sale\n\nof the car is void because he cannot transfer title to Chartway. He further argues\n\nthat he has suffered an injury, that money damages would make him whole and\n\nenable him to refund Chartway’s money, and that the two-year difference in the\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\fstatutes of limitation for conversion (2 years) and breach of contract (4 years)\n\nweighs in favor of finding that he has standing.\n\n        At trial Cao conceded that, aside from his legal fees, he had lost no money\n\ndue to this transaction, and he had $4,200 more in his bank account because he had\n\nretained the money set aside for tax, title, license, and commission. As to the\n\n$39,000 that Tieu delivered to Global Motorcars, Cao conceded it was Chartway’s\n\nmoney, not his own, saying, “I never said it was my money.” Cao testified that he\n\nwas suing on behalf of Chartway, although he had no legal right to do so.\n\n        Cao testified that he had no contact or communication with Leontaritis or\n\nGlobal Motorcars before writing the check or entrusting it to Tieu for delivery. He\n\ntestified that the only person who ever offered to sell him the vehicle was Tieu,\n\nupon whom he relied when making the check payable to Global Motorcars. Cao\n\ntestified that Tieu betrayed his trust and defrauded him by failing to bring him title\n\nto the car. Although Cao argues that he had a transaction with Global Motorcars\n\nthat went awry, the record shows that his transaction and agreement were with\n\nTieu.\n\n        Cao also testified that Chartway had not sued him regarding the car or the\n\ncheck. He described a conversation he had with a Chartway loan officer who\n\ninstructed him to “keep working on the title,” and to inform her when he had\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fobtained it. However, the court sustained an objection to this testimony and\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard it.\n\n       Neither Cao’s pleadings nor the evidence adduced at trial show that he\n\nsuffered a distinct injury as a result of the defendants’ actions. He lost no money\n\nand in fact had gained $4,200 as a result of the transaction. He conceded that the\n\nmoney did not belong to him; rather, it belonged to Chartway. But Cao has no\n\nstanding to sue for money that belongs to another party. See Shipley, 331 S.W.3d at\n\n30. In addition, to the extent that it was Tieu, not the defendants, who had\n\ndefrauded Cao, no real controversy exists between Cao and the defendants that can\n\nactually be determined by the relief sought. See Tex. Ass’n of Bus., 852 S.W.2d at\n\n446.\n\n       Cao also argued that, based on the two-year difference between the statutes\n\nof limitation for conversion and breach of contract, he anticipated that Chartway\n\nmight sue him to recover on the check. That hypothetical circumstance, were it to\n\noccur, would not change our analysis that Cao lacks standing to assert a conversion\n\nclaim on behalf of Chartway. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record\n\ndemonstrating that Cao’s professed concerns are likely to be realized. Cao testified\n\nthat Chartway had not sued him. And aside from his stricken testimony that the\n\nloan officer instructed him to continue trying to obtain the title to the car, the\n\nrecord is bereft of evidence as to whether Chartway will take action against Cao to\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\frecover the money that was initially loaned to Ha. The record in this case does not\n\nshow that any action by Chartway has occurred or is likely to occur; there is no\n\nevidence that such an injury was “imminent, direct, and immediate, and not merely\n\nremote, conjectural, or hypothetical.” See Ramon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1241293</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n\n      Because Cao has not alleged or demonstrated a concrete, particularized\n\ninjury caused by the defendants’ conduct, we hold that Cao lacks standing to sue\n\nthem for conversion.
