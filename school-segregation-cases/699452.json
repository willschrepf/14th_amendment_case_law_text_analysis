On December 22, 1966, plaintiffs filed a motion, under the basic suit, with a supporting affidavit, for a preliminary injunction to prevent opening of the school after the Christmas recess on the grounds that it was 'both unsafe and completely inadequate as a school structure.'  The court ordered a hearing on the motion and heard evidence on December 30 and 31, 1966, which included expert testimony by both parties, directed to the question of safety of the school for continued use, and heard arguments of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rendered an exhaustive oral opinion which concluded 'that the Linden School building is safe for the proposed continued occupancy.'
