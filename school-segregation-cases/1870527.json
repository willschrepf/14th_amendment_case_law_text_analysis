HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n       We consider a challenge to the use of race in undergraduate admissions at\nthe University of Texas at Austin. While the University has confined its explicit\nuse of race to the elements of a program approved by the Supreme Court in\nGrutter v. Bollinger,1 UT’s program acts upon a university applicant pool shaped\nby a legislatively-mandated parallel diversity initiative that guarantees\nadmission to Texas students in the top ten percent of their high school class.\nThe ever-increasing number of minorities gaining admission under this Top Ten\nPercent Law casts a shadow on the horizon to the otherwise-plain legality of the\nGrutter-like admissions program, the Law’s own legal footing aside. While the\nLaw’s ultimate fate is not the fare of this suit, the challenge to the Grutter plan\nhere rests upon the intimate ties and ultimate confluence of the two initiatives.\nToday we affirm the constitutionality of the University’s program as it existed\nwhen Appellants applied and were denied admission.\n       Abigail Fisher and Rachel Michalewicz, both Texas residents, were denied\nundergraduate admission to the University of Texas at Austin for the class\nentering in Fall 2008. They filed this suit alleging that UT’s admissions policies\ndiscriminated against them on the basis of race in violation of their right to\nequal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights\nstatutes.2 They sought damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.\nProceeding with separate phases of liability and remedy, the district court, in a\nthoughtful opinion, found no liability and granted summary judgment to the\nUniversity.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           539 U.S. 306 (2003).\n      2\n       Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, 590 (W.D. Tex. 2009) (citing\nU.S. CONST . amend. XIV, § 1, and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and 2000d et seq.).\n\n                                            2\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 3 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       The procedural posture of this case defines the scope of our review. There\nare no class claims and both students deny intention to reapply to UT.3 It\nfollows that Fisher and Michalewicz lack standing to seek injunctive or forward-\nlooking declaratory relief.4 This principle is rote. To obtain forward-looking\nequitable remedies, a plaintiff must show she faces imminent threat of future\ninjury.5     Without that threat, these two applicants only have standing to\nchallenge their rejection and to seek money damages for their injury.6\n       Our focus will be upon the process employed by UT to admit freshmen\nwhen Fisher and Michalewicz applied for the class entering Fall 2008, looking\nto earlier and later years only as they illuminate the rejection of these two\napplicants.7      Our task is burdened by the reality that we are examining a\ndynamic program administered by a large university subject to government\noversight. Indeed, the first of UT’s periodic five-year reviews was to begin in the\nfall of 2009, a review that must engage an array of variables, including an ever-\npresent question of whether to adjust the percentage of students admitted under\nthe two diversity initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Like all Texas residents, Appellants could attend UT Austin as transfer students if\nthey first enrolled in a participating UT system school and met the standards required by the\nCoordinated Admissions Program, discussed in greater detail below. Instead, Appellants\npermanently enrolled at other institutions.\n       4\n         See Defunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 319 (1974) (per curiam) (dismissing for lack\nof standing a suit that challenged a law school admissions policy because the plaintiff would\n“never again be required to run the gantlet of the Law School’s admissions process”).\n       5\n       Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

GRUTTER V. BOLLINGER\n       We begin with Grutter v. Bollinger because UT’s race-conscious admissions\nprocedures were modeled after the program it approved.                        In rejecting\nconstitutional challenges to the University of Michigan Law School’s admissions\nprogram, Grutter held that the Equal Protection Clause did not prohibit a\nuniversity’s “narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a\ncompelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse\nstudent body.”8 Mapping on Grutter, UT evaluates each application using a\nholistic, multi-factor approach, in which race is but one of many considerations.\nIn granting summary judgment to UT, the district court found that “it would be\ndifficult for UT to construct an admissions policy that more closely resembles the\npolicy approved by the Supreme Court in Grutter,” and “as long as Grutter\nremains good law, UT’s current admissions program remains constitutional.” 9\nLaying aside the Top Ten Percent Law, that observation is indisputably sound.10\n\n\n                                                 A\n       Grutter embraced the diversity interest articulated twenty-five years\nearlier by Justice Powell, who wrote separately in Regents of the University of\nCalifornia v. Bakke.11 This vision of diversity encompassed a broad array of\nqualifications and characteristics where race was a single but important\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343.\n       9\n         Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 612–13; see also id. at 613 (“If the Plaintiffs are right,\nGrutter is wrong.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n       10\n         In practice, the admissions systems of Michigan Law School and UT differ because\nUT’s automatic admission of the top ten percent of Texas high school seniors “largely\ndominates [its] admissions process.” Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 595. We discuss the impact\nof the Top Ten Percent Law in greater detail below.\n       11\n            438 U.S. 265, 269 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.).\n\n                                                 4\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 5 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                            No. 09-50822\n\nelement.12 The Michigan Law School designed its admissions program to achieve\nthis broad diversity, selecting students with varied backgrounds and\nexperiences—including varied racial backgrounds—who would respect and learn\nfrom one another.13 The Court explained:\n      [The Law School’s] policy makes clear there are many possible bases\n      for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who\n      have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several\n      languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship,\n      have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have\n      had successful careers in other fields.14\n\nThe Law School’s policy also reaffirmed its “longstanding commitment” to “one\nparticular type of diversity, that is, racial and ethnic diversity with special\nreference to the inclusion of students from groups which have been historically\ndiscriminated against, like African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans,\nwho without this commitment might not be represented in [the] student body in\nmeaningful numbers.”15\n      In an effort to ensure representation of minorities, the Law School sought\nto enroll a “critical mass” of minority students, which would result in increased\nminority engagement in the classroom and enhanced minority contributions to\nthe character of the School. The Grutter Court endorsed this goal, holding that\ndiversity, including seeking a critical mass of minority students, is “a compelling\nstate interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.” 16\n      That the concept of critical mass bears a simple but deceptive label is\nevidenced by the division of the Justices over its meaning. In his dissent, Chief\n\n\n      12\n           See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 325 (citing Bakke, 438 U.S. at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n      13\n           Id. at 314.\n      14\n           Id. at 338 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).\n      15\n           Id. at 316 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      16\n           Id. at 325; see id. at 329–30.\n\n                                                 5\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 6 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nJustice Rehnquist saw critical mass as only the minimum level necessary “[t]o\nensure that the[] minority students do not feel isolated or like spokespersons for\ntheir race; to provide adequate opportunities for the type of interaction upon\nwhich the educational benefits of diversity depend; and to challenge all students\nto think critically and reexamine stereotypes.”17 On this view, critical mass is\ndefined only as a proportion of the student body, and the percentage that suffices\nfor one minority group should also suffice for another group.\n      In contrast, Justice O’Connor, writing for the Court, explained that critical\nmass must be “defined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is\ndesigned to produce.”18 Her opinion recognizes that universities do more than\nsimply impart knowledge to their students. Synthesizing, we find at least three\ndistinct educational objectives served by the diversity she envisioned:\n      1.        Increased Perspectives. Justice O’Connor observed that\n                including diverse perspectives improves the quality of the\n                educational process because “classroom discussion is livelier,\n                more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting\n                when the students have the greatest possible variety of\n                backgrounds.”19 In this respect, Grutter echoes Justice\n                Powell’s recognition in Bakke that it is “essential to the\n                quality of higher education” that a university be able to\n                pursue “[t]he atmosphere of speculation, excitement and\n                creation” that is “promoted by a diverse student body.” 20\n                Indeed, diversity often brings not just excitement, but\n                valuable knowledge as well. “[A] student with a particular\n                background—whether it be ethnic, geographic, culturally\n                advantaged or disadvantaged—may bring to a [university]\n                experiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of its\n\n\n\n\n      17\n           Id. at 380 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).\n      18\n           Id. at 329–30 (opinion of the Court).\n      19\n           Id. at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      20\n           438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.)

Professionalism.       The majority pointed to “numerous\n            studies” showing that “student body diversity . . . better\n            prepares [students] as professionals.”22 The Court has\n            “repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of\n            preparing students for work and citizenship,”23 and today’s\n            students must be prepared to work within “an increasingly\n            diverse workforce.”24 Indeed, “major American businesses\n            have made clear that the skills needed in today’s increasingly\n            global marketplace can only be developed through exposure\n            to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.”25 A\n            diverse student body serves this end by “promot[ing]\n            cross-racial understanding, help[ing] to break down racial\n            stereotypes, and enabl[ing] students to better understand\n            persons of different races.” 26\n\n 3.         Civic Engagement. The Court recognized that “[e]ffective\n            participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in\n            the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one\n            Nation, indivisible, is to be realized.”27 A diverse student body\n            is crucial for fostering this ideal of civic engagement, because\n            “[i]n order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the\n            eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to\n            leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified\n            individuals of every race and ethnicity.”28 Maintaining a\n            visibly open path to leadership demands that “[a]ccess to\n            [higher] education . . . be inclusive of talented and qualified\n\n\n 21\n      Id. at 314.\n 22\n      Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n 23\n      Id.

Grutter also\ncautioned that, while it accepted diversity as a compelling interest, any sorting\nof persons on the basis of race must be by measures narrowly tailored to the\ninterest at stake.\n       As we read the Court, a university admissions program is narrowly\ntailored only if it allows for individualized consideration of applicants of all\n\n\n\n\n       29\n            Id. at 332–33. The Court further explained:\n       [E]ducation [is] pivotal to sustaining our political and cultural heritage with a\n       fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society. . . . [T]he diffusion of\n       knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must\n       be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The United\n       States, as amicus curiae, affirms that “[e]nsuring that public institutions are\n       open and available to all segments of American society, including people of all\n       races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective.” And,\n       “[n]owhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context\n       of higher education.”\n\nId. at 331–32 (final two alterations in original; citations and some internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n       30\n            Id. at 332.\n\n                                               8\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 9 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nraces.31 Such consideration does not define an applicant by race but instead\nensures that she is valued for all her unique attributes. Rather than applying\nfixed stereotypes of ways that race affects students’ lives, an admissions policy\nmust be “‘flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light\nof the particular qualifications of each applicant.’”32 As the Supreme Court later\nsummarized, “The entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the admissions\nprogram at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not\nsimply as a member of a particular racial group.”33                         Thus, a university\nadmissions policy is more likely to be narrowly tailored if it contemplates that\na broad range of qualities and experiences beyond race will be important\ncontributions to diversity and as such are appropriately considered in\nadmissions decisions.34\n       Because a race-conscious admissions program is constitutional only if\nholistic, flexible, and individualized, a university may not establish a quota for\nminority applicants, nor may it evaluate minority applications “on separate\nadmissions tracks.”35 The “racial-set-aside program” rejected by Justice Powell\nin Bakke ran afoul of these related prohibitions because it reserved 16 out of 100\nseats for members of certain minority groups.36 A university also may not award\na fixed number of bonus points to minority applicants.37 That was the lesson of\n\n\n\n       31\n            Id. at 337.\n       32\n            Id.

So\ndeployed, a white applicant raised by a single parent who did not attend high\nschool and struggled paycheck to paycheck and a minority child of a successful\ncardiovascular surgeon may both claim adversity, but the personal hurdles each\nhas cleared will not be seen to be of the same height.\n\n\n                                                C\n      Finally, Grutter requires that any race-conscious measures must have a\n“logical end point” and be “limited in time.”39 This durational requirement can\nbe satisfied by sunset provisions or by periodic reviews to reconsider whether\nthere are feasible race-neutral alternatives that would achieve diversity\ninterests “‘about as well.’”40 In this respect, Grutter is best seen not as an\nunqualified endorsement of racial preferences, but as a transient response to\nanemic academic diversity. As Justice O’Connor observed, “We expect that 25\nyears from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to\nfurther the interest approved today.” 41\n\n\n\n\n      38\n           Id.\n      39\n           Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342.\n      40\n           Id. at 339 (quoting Wygant v.

HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY’S ADMISSIONS POLICIES\n       Justice O’Connor’s vision may prove to be more aspirational than\npredictive. Regardless, universities will construct admissions programs wedded\nto their missions, which include bringing both meritorious and diverse students\nto campus. Each year, UT receives applications from approximately four times\nmore students than it can enroll.42              Over the past two decades, UT has\nrepeatedly revised its admissions procedures to reflect its calculus of educational\nvalues while navigating judicial decisions and legislative mandates.\n\n\n                                               A\n       Until 1996, UT selected students using two metrics. The first measure,\nstill employed today, is the Academic Index (“AI”), a computation based on the\nstudent’s high school class rank, standardized test scores, and the extent to\nwhich the applicant exceeded UT’s required high school curriculum.43 Perceiving\nthat AI alone would produce a class with unacceptably low diversity levels, UT\nconsidered a second element for admissions—race. These measures combined\nresulted in UT admitting more than 90% of applicants who were ranked in the\ntop ten percent of their high school class.44\n       There were then no clear legal limits on a university’s use of race in\nadmissions. The Supreme Court decided Bakke in 1978 but its guidance came\n\n\n\n\n       42\n            Fisher, 645 F.

Higher Educ. Opportunity Project\nWorking Paper), available at http://theop.princeton.edu/workingpapers.html. Unlike the\ncurrent Top Ten Percent Law, UT’s earlier policies did not mandate the admission of all top\nten percent students. Thus, even though a top ranking at a predominantly minority high\nschool would contribute to a higher AI score, the AI alone could not effectively serve as a proxy\nfor race because, on average, minorities received lower standardized test scores.\n\n                                               11\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 12 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nin a fractured decision, leaving a quarter century of uncertainty.45 The record\ndoes not detail precisely how race factored in admissions decisions during this\ntime, but it is undisputed that race was considered directly and was often a\ncontrolling factor in admission.46 Under this race-conscious admissions policy,\nthe freshman class entering in Fall 1993 included 5,329 students, of whom 238\nwere African-American (4.5% of the overall class) and 832 were Hispanic\n(15.6%).47\n\n\n                                                B\n       Race-conscious admissions ended in 1996 with Hopwood v. Texas, when\na panel of this court struck down the use of race-based criteria in admissions\n\n\n       45\n         Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978). Four Justices would have\nheld that universities have broad authority to consider race in admissions in order to “remedy\ndisadvantage cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.” Id. at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan,\nWhite, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ.). Four other Justices would have held that Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 bars federally funded universities from making any admissions\ndecisions on the basis of race. Id. at 417–18 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C.J., and\nStewart and Rehnquist, JJ.). Justice Powell cast the decisive vote in a separate opinion—not\njoined in full by any other Justice—that invalidated the racial set-aside in the admissions\nprogram then before the Court, but reasoned that it would be constitutional for a university\nto consider race as one facet of diversity in a flexible review that treated each applicant as an\nindividual. Id. at 316–19 (opinion of Powell, J.). Because none of these positions carried the\nsupport of a majority of the Court, it was not completely clear which (if any) of these rationales\nwas controlling.

In contrast to\nthe mechanical formulas used to calculate the AI, the PAI was meant “to identify\nand reward students whose merit as applicants was not adequately reflected by\ntheir class rank and test scores.”51 Although facially race-neutral, the PAI was\nin part designed to increase minority enrollment; many of the PAI factors\ndisproportionately affected minority applicants.52\n      UT also implemented other facially “race-neutral” policies that, together\nwith the AI and PAI, remain in use today. It created targeted scholarship\nprograms to increase its yield among minority students, expanded the quality\nand quantity of its outreach efforts to high schools in underrepresented areas of\nthe state, and focused additional attention and resources on recruitment in\nlow-performing schools.53\n      Despite these efforts, minority presence at UT decreased immediately.\nAlthough the 1996 admissions decisions were not affected by Hopwood, the\npublicity from the case impacted the number of admitted minorities who chose\nto enroll.

Compared to 1995, African-American enrollment for 1997 dropped\nalmost 40% (from 309 to 190 entering freshmen) while Hispanic enrollment\ndecreased by 5% (from 935 to 892 entering freshmen).

African-American enrollment rose from 2.7% to 3.0% and\nHispanic enrollment rose from 12.6% to 13.2%. However, the absolute number\nof minorities remained stable as a result of a smaller freshman class. Over time,\nboth the number and percentage of enrolled Hispanics and African-Americans\nincreased.

In 2004, among freshmen who were\nTexas residents, 77% of the enrolled African-American students and 78% of the\nHispanic students had been admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law, compared\nto 62% of Caucasian students.58 These numbers highlight the contribution of the\nTop Ten Percent Law to increasing minority enrollment, but they also reflect a\ntrade-off implicit in the Law: the increase rested heavily on the pass from\nstandardized testing offered by the Top Ten Percent Law. After implementation\nof the Law, the likelihood of acceptance for African-American and Hispanic\nstudents in the second decile of their high school class, who were without the\nbenefits of the pass from standardized testing, declined.

The first study examined minority representation in undergraduate\nclasses, focusing on classes of “participatory size,” which it defined as between\n5 and 24 students. UT analyzed these classes, which included most of the\nundergraduate courses, because they offered the best opportunity for robust\nclassroom discussion, rich soil for diverse interactions. According to the study,\n90% of these smaller classes in Fall 2002 had either one or zero\nAfrican-American students, 46% had one or zero Asian-American students, and\n43% had one or zero Hispanic students.62 A later retabulation, which excluded\nthe very smallest of these classes and considered only classes with 10 to 24\nstudents, found          that   89%     of those     classes had       either one      or zero\nAfrican-American students, 41% had one or zero Asian-American students, and\n37% had either one or zero Hispanic students.63                     In its second study, UT\nsurveyed undergraduates on their impressions of diversity on campus and in the\nclassroom. Minority students reported feeling isolated, and a majority of all\nstudents felt there was “insufficient minority representation” in classrooms for\n“the full benefits of diversity to occur.” 64\n       The University incorporated the findings of these two studies in its June\n2004 Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions.65                        The 2004\nProposal concluded that diverse student enrollment “break[s] down stereotypes,”\n“promotes cross-racial understanding,” and “prepares students for an\n\n\n       62\n         Fisher, 645 F.

One magazine\ndedicated to diversity in higher education ranked UT “sixth in the nation in\nproducing undergraduate degrees for minority groups.” 71 In an entering class\nthat was roughly the same size in 1998 as it was in 2008, the enrollment of\nAfrican-American students doubled from 165 students to 335 students. Hispanic\nenrollment increased approximately 1.5 times, from 762 students to 1,228\nstudents. Asian-American enrollment also increased nearly 10%, from 1,034\nstudents to 1,126 students.72 By contrast, in 2004, the last year the Top Ten\nPercent Law operated without the Grutter plan, fall enrollment included only\n275 African-Americans and 1,024 Hispanics.\n       Because of the myriad programs instituted, it can be difficult to attribute\nincreases in minority enrollment to any one initiative.                      In addition,\ndemographics have shifted in Texas, so increases in minority enrollment likely\nin part reflect the increased presence of minorities statewide.\n\n\n                          III. THE CHALLENGED POLICY\n       UT’s consideration of race is one part of the complex admissions process\noperating when Appellants were rejected. Given Appellants’ challenge, we must\nexamine the whole of the process.\n\n\n       70\n            Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 594.\n       71\n         Id. This particular ranking is somewhat limited in its significance, however, as the\nresults are based on raw tabulations of the number of degrees conferred upon minority\nstudents. Large schools, like UT, are more likely to be ranked higher simply because they\ngraduate a greater number of students (both minorities and non-minorities).

Accordingly, it begins\nits admissions process by dividing applicants into three pools: (1) Texas\nresidents, (2) domestic non-Texas residents, and (3) international students.\nStudents compete for admission only against other students in their respective\npool. Texas residents are allotted 90% of all available seats, with admission\nbased on a two-tiered system, beginning with students automatically admitted\nunder the Top Ten Percent Law and then filling the remaining seats on the basis\nof the Academic and Personal Achievement Indices.73 Because Appellants are\nTexas residents, their challenge focuses on the admissions procedures applied\nto in-state applicants.\n       Texas applicants are divided into two subgroups: (1) Texas residents who\nare in the top ten percent of their high school class and (2) those Texas residents\nwho are not.      Top ten percent applicants are guaranteed admission to the\nUniversity, and the vast majority of freshmen are selected in this way, without\na confessed consideration of race. In 2008, for example, 81% of the entering class\nwas admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law, filling 88% of the seats allotted\nto Texas residents and leaving only 1,216 offers of admission university-wide for\nnon-top ten percent residents.74 The impact of the Top Ten Percent Law on UT’s\nadmissions has increased dramatically since it was first introduced in 1998,\n\n\n\n\n       73\n        Admission decisions for domestic non-Texas residents and international applicants\nare made solely on the basis of their Academic and Personal Achievement Indices.\n       74\n         2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 8 tbl.2, 9 tbl.2b. Table 2 shows 8,984 top ten percent\nstudents were admitted in 2008. The UT Associate Director of Admissions reported that\n10,200 admissions slots are available for Texas residents, leaving 1,216 slots for non-top ten\npercent students. Ishop Aff. (Dist. Ct. Dkt.

Others are low enough that\ntheir applications are considered presumptively denied. If an application is\npresumptively denied, senior admission staff review the file and may, on rare\noccasions, designate the file for full review notwithstanding the AI score.78\n       The Personal Achievement Index is based on three scores: one score for\neach of the two required essays and a third score, called the personal\nachievement score, which represents an evaluation of the applicant’s entire file.\nThe essays are each given a score between 1 and 6 through “a holistic evaluation\nof the essay as a piece of writing based on its complexity of thought,\n\n\n\n\n       75\n         Id. at 7 tbl.1a. In 1998, out of a class that included 6,110 Texas residents, only 2,513\nenrolled freshmen were admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law.\n       76\n         The district court found that, on “relatively rare” occasions, a holistic review of the\nentire application may result in the University admitting an applicant to the fall class even\nthough his or her AI or PAI scores fall just shy of the official cutoff. See Fisher, 645 F. Supp.\n2d at 599.\n       77\n         Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 596. The precise formulas used to calculate an applicant’s\nAcademic Index are derived by regression analysis and vary by intended major. For instance,\nthe formula for prospective engineering majors gives greater weight to math scores, whereas\nthe formula for prospective liberal arts majors gives somewhat greater weight to verbal scores.\nSee 2004 Proposal at 27 & n.5. The differences in these formulas are immaterial to the\npresent case.\n       78\n         In other words, no applicant is denied admission based purely on AI score without\nhaving her file reviewed by at least one admissions reader and her individual circumstances\nconsidered.\n\n                                               20\n\f       Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 21 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nsubstantiality of development, and facility with language.”79                    The personal\nachievement score is also based on a scale of 1 to 6, although it is given slightly\ngreater weight in the final PAI calculation than the mean of the two essay\nscores.80\n        This personal achievement score is designed to recognize qualified\nstudents whose merit as applicants was not adequately reflected by their\nAcademic Index. Admissions staff assign the score by assessing an applicant’s\ndemonstrated leadership qualities, awards and honors, work experience, and\ninvolvement in extracurricular activities and community service. In addition,\nthe personal achievement score includes a “special circumstances” element that\nmay reflect the socioeconomic status of the applicant and his or her high school,\nthe applicant’s family status and family responsibilities, the applicant’s\nstandardized test score compared to the average of her high school,\nand—beginning in 2004—the applicant’s race.81                   To assess these intangible\nfactors, evaluators read the applicant’s essays again, but this time with an eye\nto the information conveyed rather than the quality of the student’s writing.\nAdmissions officers undergo annual training by a nationally recognized expert\nin holistic scoring, and senior staff members perform quality control to verify\nthat awarded scores are appropriate and consistent. The most recent study, in\n2005, found that holistic file readers scored within one point of each other 88%\nof the time.82\n\n\n\n\n        79\n             Fisher, 645 F.

Rather, the file is evaluated as a whole in order to provide the\nfullest possible understanding of the student as a person and to place his or her\nachievements in context.83          As UT’s director of admissions explained, “race\nprovides—like [the] language [spoken in the applicant’s home], whether or not\nsomeone       is   the   first in    their family to       attend   college, and    family\nresponsibilities—important context in which to evaluate applicants, and is only\none aspect of the diversity that the University seeks to attain.” 84               Race is\nconsidered as part of the applicant’s context whether or not the applicant\nbelongs to a minority group, and so—at least in theory—it “can positively impact\napplicants of all races, including Caucasian[s], or [it] may have no impact\nwhatsoever.”85 Moreover, given the mechanics of UT’s admissions process, race\nhas the potential to influence only a small part of the applicant’s overall\nadmissions score. The sole instance when race is considered is as one element\nof the personal achievement score, which itself is only a part of the total PAI.\nWithout a sufficiently high AI and well-written essays, an applicant with even\nthe highest personal achievement score will still be denied admission.86\n\n\n                                               B\n      Although the process for calculating AI and PAI scores is common to all\nparts of the University, each offer of admission to UT is ultimately tied to an\nindividual school or major.

To avoid oversubscription and\nto allow these colleges and majors to admit some non-top ten percent applicants,\nUT caps the percentage of students automatically admitted to these programs\nat 75% of the available spaces.88\n       Top Ten Percent Law applicants who do not receive automatic entry to\ntheir first choice program compete for admission to the remaining spaces, and\nif necessary to their second-choice program, on the basis of their AI and PAI\nscores. The admissions office places students into matrices for each preferred\nschool or major, with students grouped by AI score along one axis and PAI score\nalong the other axis. Liaisons for the majors then establish a cutoff line, which\nis drawn in a stair-step pattern. Applicants denied admission to their first-\nchoice program are considered for their second choice, with cutoff lines\nreadjusted to reflect the influx of those applicants.              Any top ten percent\napplicants not admitted to either their first- or second-choice program are\nautomatically admitted as Liberal Arts Undeclared majors.

Instead, those residents not admitted to the entering fall class are\noffered admission to either the summer program or the Coordinated Admissions\nProgram (CAP). Marginal applicants who missed the cutoff for the fall class are\noffered admission to the summer program, which permits students to begin their\nstudies at UT during the summer and then join the regularly admitted students\nin the fall. About 800 students enroll in the summer program each year. All\nremaining Texas applicants are automatically enrolled in CAP, which\nguarantees admission as a transfer student if the student enrolls in another UT\nsystem campus for her freshman year and meets certain other conditions,\nincluding the completion of thirty credit hours with a cumulative grade point\naverage of 3.2 or higher.\n\n\n                                          C\n         The Academic Index and Personal Achievement Index now employed by\nUT have been in continuous use since 1997. The lone substantive change came\nin 2005, following the Grutter decision, when the Board of Regents authorized\nthe consideration of race as another “special circumstance” in assessing an\napplicant’s personal achievement score.\n         Race—like all other elements of UT’s holistic review—is not considered\nalone.     Admissions officers reviewing each application are aware of the\napplicant’s race, but UT does not monitor the aggregate racial composition of the\nadmitted applicant pool during the process. The admissions decision for any\nparticular applicant is not affected—positively or negatively—by the number of\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 25 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nother students in her racial group who have been admitted during that year.89\nThus, “it is difficult to evaluate which applicants have been positively or\nnegatively affected by its consideration or which applicants were ultimately\noffered admission due to their race who would not have otherwise been offered\nadmission.”90 Nevertheless, the district court found that race “is undisputedly\na meaningful factor that can make a difference in the evaluation of a student’s\napplication.” 91\n\n\n                                                   D\n       UT undoubtedly has a compelling interest in obtaining the educational\nbenefits of diversity, and its reasons for implementing race-conscious\nadmissions—expressed in the 2004 Proposal—mirror those approved by the\nSupreme Court in Grutter.            The district court found that both the UT and\nGrutter policies “attempt to promote ‘cross-racial understanding,’ ‘break down\nracial stereotypes,’ enable students to better understand persons of other races,\nbetter prepare students to function in a multi-cultural workforce, cultivate the\nnext set of national leaders, and prevent minority students from serving as\n‘spokespersons’ for their race.”92          Like the law school in Grutter, UT “has\n\n\n       89\n            Fisher, 645 F.

First, these decisions are a product of “complex\neducational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the\nuniversity,” far outside the experience of the courts.97 Second, “universities\noccupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition,” with educational\nautonomy grounded in the First Amendment.98 As Justice Powell explained in\nBakke, “[a]cademic freedom . . . . includes [a university’s] selection of its student\nbody.”99\n      Yet the scrutiny triggered by racial classification “is no less strict for\ntaking into account” the special circumstances of higher education.100 “[S]trict\nscrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the\nimportance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental\ndecisionmaker for the use of race in [a] particular context.”101 Narrow tailoring,\na component of strict scrutiny, requires any use of racial classifications to so\nclosely fit a compelling goal as to remove the possibility that the motive for the\nclassification was illegitimate racial stereotype. Rather than second-guess the\nmerits of the University’s decision, a task we are ill-equipped to perform, we\ninstead scrutinize the University’s decisionmaking process to ensure that its\ndecision to adopt a race-conscious admissions policy followed from the good faith\nconsideration Grutter requires. We presume the University acted in good faith,\n\n\n\n\n      97\n           Id. at 328.\n      98\n           Id. at 329.\n      99\n           Bakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n      100\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328.\n      101\n            Id. at 327.\n\n                                               27\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 28 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                      No. 09-50822\n\na presumption Appellants are free to rebut.102 Relatedly, while we focus on the\nUniversity’s decision to adopt a Grutter-like plan, admissions outcomes remain\nrelevant evidence of the plan’s necessity—a reality check.\n\n\n                                             B\n       With a nod to Grutter’s command that we generally give a degree of\ndeference to a university’s educational judgments, Appellants urge that Grutter\ndid not extend such deference to a university’s decision to implement a race-\nconscious admissions policy. Instead, they maintain Grutter deferred only to the\nuniversity’s judgment that diversity would have educational benefits, not to the\nassessment of whether the university has attained critical mass of a racial group\nor whether race-conscious efforts are necessary to achieve that end.\n       As an initial matter, this argument in its full flower is contradicted by\nGrutter.       The majority held that, like the examination into whether the\nUniversity has a compelling interest, “the narrow-tailoring inquiry . . . must be\ncalibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the use of race to achieve student\nbody diversity in public higher education.”103          That is, the narrow-tailoring\ninquiry—like the compelling-interest inquiry—is undertaken with a degree of\ndeference to the University’s constitutionally protected, presumably expert\nacademic judgment.\n       Appellants would have us borrow a more restrictive standard of review\nfrom a series of public employment and government contracting cases, in which\nthe Supreme Court “held that certain government actions to remedy past racial\ndiscrimination—actions that are themselves based on race—are constitutional\nonly where there is a ‘strong basis in evidence’ that the remedial actions were\n\n\n       102\n          Id. at 329 (“[G]ood faith on the part of a university is presumed absent a showing\nto the contrary.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318–19\n(opinion of Powell, J.))).\n       103\n             Id. at 333–34.\n\n                                            28\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 29 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nnecessary.”104 The Court most recently applied this strong-basis-in-evidence\nstandard in Ricci v. DeStefano.\n       In Ricci, white firefighters from New Haven, Connecticut sued under Title\nVII, challenging the city’s decision to disregard a promotions test after the\nresults showed that white candidates significantly outperformed minority\ncandidates.105 New Haven defended this action, arguing that if it had ratified\nthe test results it could have faced liability under Title VII for adopting a\npractice that had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.106 The white\nfirefighters, however, argued that ignoring the test results was a violation of\nTitle VII’s separate prohibition against intentional race discrimination, or\ndisparate treatment.107 Responding to this tension, the Supreme Court held that\nsuch intentional race-based action is not permitted by Title VII unless the\nemployer can demonstrate with a strong basis in evidence that it would have\nbeen liable under the disparate impact provision had it not taken the action.108\nThe Court suggested that anything less would risk creating a de facto quota\nsystem, where an employer could disregard test results to achieve a preferred\nracial balance, impermissibly shifting the focus from individual discrimination\nto group bias.109 Applying the strong-basis-in-evidence standard, the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n       104\n          Ricci v.

Yet\nthe Court found that an intent-based standard could not be squared with the\nstatutory text. The Ricci Court turned to the strong-basis-in-evidence standard\n“as a matter of statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the\ndisparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.” 111\n       Although Ricci did not address the firefighters’ equal protection claim, the\nCourt derived its standard from Richmond v.

In doing so, it touches the third rail of racial quotas.\nWygant and Croson both involved explicit quotas; in Ricci, the Court was\nconcerned that the city’s use of race threatened to devolve into a de facto quota.\n      By contrast, Grutter recognized that universities are engaged in a\ndifferent enterprise. Their holistic approach is part of a forward-looking effort\nto obtain the educational benefits of diversity. The look to race as but one\nelement of this further goal, coupled with individualized consideration, steers\nuniversity admissions away from a quota system. Grutter teaches that so long\nas a university considers race in a holistic and individualized manner, and not\nas part of a quota or fixed-point system, courts must afford a measure of\ndeference to the university’s good faith determination that certain race-conscious\nmeasures are necessary to achieve the educational benefits of diversity,\nincluding attaining critical mass in minority enrollment.\n      Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\nfurther supports this understanding.116 When scrutinizing two school districts’\nrace-conscious busing plans, the Court invoked Grutter’s “serious, good faith\nconsideration” standard, rather than the strong-basis-in-evidence standard that\nAppellants would have us apply.117 The Parents Involved Court never suggested\nthat the school districts would be required to prove their plans were meticulously\nsupported by some particular quantum of specific evidence. Rather, the Court\nstruck down the school districts’ programs because they pursued racial balancing\nand defined students based on racial group classifications, not on individual\ncircumstances.\n      In short, the Court has not retreated from Grutter’s mode of analysis, one\ntailored to holistic university admissions programs.

Rather, Appellants question whether UT needs a Grutter-like\npolicy. As their argument goes, the University’s race-conscious admissions\nprogram is unwarranted because (1) UT has gone beyond a mere interest in\ndiversity for education’s sake and instead pursues a racial composition that\nmirrors that of the state of Texas as a whole, amounting to an unconstitutional\nattempt to achieve “racial balancing”; (2) the University has not given adequate\nconsideration to available “race-neutral” alternatives, particularly percentage\nplans like the Top Ten Percent Law; and (3) UT’s minority enrollment under the\nTop Ten Percent Law already surpassed critical mass, such that the additional\n(and allegedly “minimal”) increase in diversity achieved through UT’s Grutter-\nlike policy does not justify its use of race-conscious measures. We will consider\neach of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n                                V. RACIAL BALANCING\n      Again, diversity is a permissible goal for educational institutions, but\n“outright racial balancing” is not. Attempting to ensure that the student body\ncontains some specified percentage of a particular racial group is “patently\nunconstitutional.”118 This concept follows from the Supreme Court’s repeated\nemphasis that, by itself, increasing racial representation is not a sufficiently\ncompelling interest to justify the use of racial preferences. Grutter described\n\n\n      118\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 329–30 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n\n                                                32\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 33 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nmany important educational interests that may be sought through diversity, but\nsteadfastly maintained that “‘[r]acial balance is not to be to be achieved for its\nown sake.’”119 Moreover, “[t]he point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which\nthe Grutter Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications\nwas indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort\nto achieve racial balance” by creating an unconstitutional quota.120\n\n\n                                                  A\n       Looking to the details of UT’s race-conscious admissions policy, it is clear\nthat administrators knew a quota system would not survive judicial review, and\nthey took care to avoid this fatal mistake. UT’s system was modeled after the\nGrutter program, which the Supreme Court held was not a quota. UT has never\nestablished a specific number, percentage, or range of minority enrollment that\nwould constitute “critical mass,” nor does it award any fixed number of points to\nminority students in a way that impermissibly values race for its own sake.121\n       Further, there is no indication that UT’s Grutter-like plan is a quota by\nanother name. It is true that UT looks in part to the number of minority\n\n\n\n       119\n             Id. at 330 (quoting Freeman v.

On the\ncontrary, if UT were to identify some numerical target for minority enrollment, that would\nlikely render the policy unconstitutional under Grutter.\n\n                                                  33\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 34 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nstudents when evaluating whether it has yet achieved a critical mass, but\n“[s]ome attention to numbers, without more, does not transform a flexible\nadmissions system into a rigid quota.”122 Whereas a quota imposes a fixed\npercentage standard that cannot be deviated from, a permissible diversity goal\n“‘require[s] only a good-faith effort . . . to come within a range demarcated by the\ngoal itself.’”123 Indeed, UT’s policy improves upon the program approved in\nGrutter because the University does not keep an ongoing tally of the racial\ncomposition of the entering class during its admissions process.124\n      UT has not admitted students so that its undergraduate population\ndirectly mirrors the demographics of Texas. Its methods and efforts belie the\ncharge.      The percentage of Hispanics at UT is less than two-thirds the\npercentage of Hispanics in Texas, and the percentage of African-Americans at\nUT is half the percentage of Texas’s African-American population, while\nAsian-American enrollment is more than five times the percentage of Texan\nAsian-Americans.125\n\n\n                                                B\n      Appellants nevertheless argue that UT’s program amounts to racial\nbalancing because it supposedly evinces a special concern for demographically\nunderrepresented groups, while neglecting the diverse contributions of others.\nThese arguments do not account for the operation of UT’s admissions system or\nthe scope of the diversity interest approved by the Court in Grutter.\n\n\n\n\n      122\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336 (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).\n      123\n            Id. at 335 (quoting Sheet Metal Workers v.

This possibility is the point of Grutter’s holistic and individualized\nassessments, which must be “‘flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements\nof diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant.’”127 Indeed,\njust as in Grutter, UT applicants of every race may submit supplemental\ninformation to highlight their potential diversity contributions, which allows\nstudents who are diverse in unconventional ways to describe their unique\nattributes.128\n      The summary judgment record shows that demographics are not consulted\nas part of any individual admissions decision, and UT’s admissions procedures\ndo not treat certain racial groups or minorities differently than others when\nreviewing individual applications. Rather, the act of considering minority group\ndemographics (to which Appellants object) took place only when the University\nfirst studied whether a race-conscious admissions program was needed to attain\ncritical mass. Appellants’ objection therefore must be directed not to the design\nof the program, but rather to whether UT’s decision to reintroduce race as a\nfactor in admissions was made in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n      126\n            Id. at 606.\n      127\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n      128\n            Id. at 338; see Fisher, 645 F.

They insist that if UT were truly focused\non educational benefits and critical mass, then there should be no reason to\nconsult demographic data when determining whether UT had sufficient minority\nrepresentation.\n      We disagree. The University’s policies and measured attention to the\ncommunity it serves are consonant with the educational goals outlined in\nGrutter and do not support a finding that the University was engaged in\nimproper racial balancing during our time frame of review. Both Grutter and\nBakke recognized that “there is of course ‘some relationship between numbers\nand achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body.’”129 In its\npolicymaking process, UT gave appropriate attention to those educational\nbenefits identified in Grutter without overstepping any constitutional bounds.\n      Grutter recognized that racial and ethnic backgrounds play an influential\nrole in producing the diversity of views and perspectives which are paramount\nto a university’s educational mission.              As Justice O’Connor explained, the\n“unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which\nrace unfortunately still matters” can have a significant impact on a student’s\nviews.130 The Court acknowledged that “[b]y virtue of our Nation’s struggle with\nracial inequality, [underrepresented minority students] are both likely to have\nexperiences with particular importance to the [University’s] mission, and less\nlikely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore these\nexperiences.”131 UT properly concluded that these individuals from the state’s\n\n\n      129\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 323 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n      130\n            Id. at 333.\n      131\n            Id. at 338.\n\n                                               36\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 37 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nunderrepresented minorities would be most likely to add unique perspectives\nthat are otherwise absent from its classrooms. Identifying which backgrounds\nare underrepresented, in turn, presupposes some reference to demographics, and\nit was therefore appropriate for UT to give limited attention to this data when\nconsidering whether its current student body included a critical mass of\nunderrepresented groups.\n      Preparing students to function as professionals in an increasingly diverse\nworkforce likewise calls for some consideration of a university’s particular\neducational mission and the community it serves. For instance, a nationally\nrenowned law school draws upon a nationwide applicant pool and sends its\ngraduates into careers in all states; therefore it is appropriate for such a school\nto consider national diversity levels when setting goals for its admissions\nprogram. In contrast, UT’s stated goal is to “produce graduates who are capable\nof fulfilling the future leadership needs of Texas.”132 This objective calls for a\nmore tailored diversity emphasis.            In a state as racially diverse as Texas,\nensuring that graduates learn to collaborate with members of racial groups they\nwill encounter in the workforce is especially important. The 2004 Proposal\nconcluded that a race-conscious admissions program was necessary at UT\nspecifically because “from a racial, ethnic, and cultural standpoint, students at\nthe University [were] being educated in a less-than-realistic environment that\n[was] not conducive to training the leaders of tomorrow.” 133\n      The need for a state’s leading educational institution to foster civic\nengagement and maintain visibly open paths to leadership also requires a degree\nof attention to the surrounding community. A university presenting itself as\nopen to all may be challenged when the state’s minority population grows\nsteadily but minority enrollment does not.

But through the Top Ten Percent Law and Grutter-like\nplan, UT has increased its minority applicant pool in its effort to ensure that it\nserves as a flagship university for the entire state, not just Texans of certain\nbackgrounds. Cultivating paths to leadership for underrepresented groups\nserves both the individual and the public, sustaining an infrastructure of leaders\nin an increasingly pluralistic society.             Although a university must eschew\ndemographic targets, it need not be blind to significant racial disparities in its\ncommunity, nor is it wholly prohibited from taking the degree of disparity into\naccount.\n       Finally, Grutter’s structure accepts that a university’s twin objectives of\nrewarding academic merit and fostering diversity can be complementary rather\nthan competing goals; that students rising to the top of underrepresented groups\ndemonstrate promise as future leaders. These students’ relative success in the\nface of harmful and widespread stereotypes evidences a degree of drive,\ndetermination, and merit not captured by test scores alone.                         Insofar as\nAppellants complain that the University’s limited attention to demographics was\ninconsistent with the legitimate educational concerns recognized in Bakke and\nGrutter, we conclude that their contention cannot be sustained.\n\n\n\n       134\n             Id. at 14.\n       135\n          See, e.g., Mark C.

While Appellants’ view may comport with\none literal interpretation of the “critical mass” label, it is not the view that\nprevailed in Grutter. The Grutter majority defined critical mass “by reference\nto the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce,”136 and the\neducational benefits recognized in Grutter go beyond the narrow “pedagogical\nconcept” urged by Appellants. On this understanding, there is no reason to\nassume that critical mass will or should be the same for every racial group or\nevery university.        We are persuaded, as was the district court, that the\nUniversity adhered to Grutter when it reintroduced race into its admissions\nprocess based in part on an analysis that devoted special attention to those\nminorities which were most significantly underrepresented on its campus.\n\n\n                         VI. THE TOP TEN PERCENT LAW\n      Grutter is best read as a path toward the moment when all race-conscious\nmeasures become unnecessary. To that end, Grutter requires universities that\nemploy race-conscious admissions to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives.\nBut “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable\nrace-neutral alternative,” especially if the proffered alternatives would require\nthe University to sacrifice other important interests, like its academic selectivity\nand reputation for excellence.137\n\n\n      136\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339.\n      137\n            See id. at 339–340.\n\n                                            39\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 40 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       The parties devote significant attention to the Top Ten Percent Law.138\nSince the Law was first enacted in 1997, UT has seen increases in both\nAfrican-American and Hispanic enrollment, but again, changing demographics\nand other minority outreach programs render it difficult to quantify the\nincreases attributable to the Top Ten Percent Law.139\n       Appellants put forward the Top Ten Percent Law as a facially race-neutral\nalternative that would allow UT to obtain a critical mass of minority enrollment\nwithout resorting to race-conscious admissions. As the argument goes, if the Top\nTen Percent Law were able to serve the University’s interests “about as well” as\nrace-conscious admissions, without differentiating between students on the basis\nof   race,     then    it   would    render     UT’s    current     admissions      program\nunconstitutional.140        UT responds that the Top Ten Percent Law does not\nconstitute a workable alternative to a flexible admissions system, and so it is\n“entirely irrelevant” as a matter of law in determining whether or not a\nuniversity may adopt the holistic consideration of race to achieve critical mass.\n       UT is correct that so-called “percentage plans” are not a constitutionally\nmandated replacement for race-conscious admissions programs under Grutter,\nalthough—as will become apparent—this realization alone does not end our\nconstitutional inquiry. The idea of percentage plans as a viable alternative to\nrace-conscious admissions policies was directly advocated to the Grutter Court\n\n\n\n\n      138\n           TEX . ED U C . CODE § 51.803 (1997). The precise impact UT’s other race-neutral\nalternatives (such as scholarship and outreach programs) have had on minority enrollment\nis not clear, but their effect would not appear to be great enough to bear on the\nconstitutionality of the University’s race-conscious admissions policy.\n      139\n         Fisher, 645 F.

By now it is clear that the Law is\ninescapably tied to UT’s Grutter plan, as Grutter does its work with the\napplicants who remain after the cut of the Top Ten Percent Law. In 2008, top\nten percent applicants accounted for 8,984 of the 10,200 Texas admittees.144\nThus, with the Top Ten Percent Law in effect, UT’s Grutter plan can only\npossibly influence the review of approximately 1,200 admitted students’\napplications.145 In evaluating the constitutionality of an admissions program,\n\n\n\n\n       141\n        The United States has since filed an amicus brief in the present case, urging us to\nuphold UT’s current admissions program.\n       142\n             Grutter, 539 U.S. at 340 (internal citation omitted).\n       143\n             Id.\n       144\n             2008 Top Ten Report at 8 tbl.2; Ishop Aff.

See Ishop Aff. (Dist. Ct. Dkt.

In the College of\nEducation, 22.4% of students are Hispanic and 10.1% are African-American. By\ncontrast, in the College of Business Administration, only 14.5% of the students\nare Hispanic and 3.4% are African-American.148 It is evident that if UT is to\nhave diverse interactions, it needs more minority students who are interested\nin and meet the requirements for a greater variety of colleges, not more students\ndisproportionately enrolled in certain programs.

We also\nnote that since it began, the Top Ten Percent Law has had an increasing impact on admissions\ndecisions. In 1998, top ten percent candidates comprised just 41% of Texans in the freshman\nclass. In 2004, 66% of Texan freshmen were top ten percent students, and in 2008, top ten\npercent students made up 81% of the Texas freshmen seats. While the legislative 75% cap on\ntop ten percent enrollment may help alleviate some of the concerns with this plan, the fact\nremains that the Top Ten Percent Law operates today very differently than it did when first\nimplemented.\n       147\n           See Univ. of Tex. at Austin Office of Info.

By ignoring these other diversity\ncontributions, the Top Ten Percent Law restricts the University’s ability to\nachieve the maximum educational benefits of a truly diverse student body.150 As\nUT’s 2003 classroom study shows, percentage plans bear little promise of\nproducing the meaningful diverse interactions envisioned by Grutter, at least not\nin the classroom.          For instance, the study reported that although overall\nenrollment of minority students at UT rose significantly between 1996 and 2002,\nthe Fall 2002 schedule contained more classes with zero or one African American\nor Hispanic students than had the Fall 1996 schedule.151\n       Justice Ginsburg pointed out in Grutter’s companion case that percentage\nplans create damaging incentives to the education system. She observed that\n“[p]ercentage plans depend for their effectiveness on continued racial\nsegregation at the secondary school level.” These measures “encourage parents\n\n\n       149\n            For example, instead of admitting a minority top ten percent student from a\nlow-performing school, UT might admit a minority student with an interest in business who\nis just as academically qualified (and perhaps more so), but falls outside the top ten percent\nof his high school class because he attends a more competitive high school. This example also\ndemonstrates how the Top Ten Percent Law hurts academic selectivity: UT must admit a top\nten percent student from a low-performing high school before admitting a more qualified\nminority student who ranks just below the top ten percent at a highly competitive high school.\nThis effect, in turn, further widens the “credentials gap” between minority and non-minority\nstudents at the University, which risks driving away matriculating minority students from\ndifficult majors like business or the sciences.\n       150\n           The Top Ten Percent Law may produce diversity beyond varying hometowns,\nincluding differences in socioeconomic status and rural/urban/suburban upbringing. However,\nunder the Top Ten Percent Law, the University does not have the opportunity to select for a\nwide range of diverse experiences (such as travel abroad, extra-curricular involvement, or\nwork experience), so the Top Ten Percent Law bluntly operates as an attempt to create\ndiversity through reliance on perceived group characteristics and segregated communities.\n       151\n             2004 Proposal at 25 & tbl.8.\n\n                                                43\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 44 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nto keep their children in low-performing segregated schools, and discourage\nstudents from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point\naverages.”152        Similarly, these plans create a strong incentive to avoid\ncompetitive educational institutions like magnet schools.153\n       Texas applicants falling outside the top ten percent group face extreme\ncompetition to gain admittance to the University. There are approximately\n16,000 students competing for only 1,216 fall admissions slots. The competition\nis so great that, on average, students admitted from outside the top ten percent\nof their high school class, regardless of race, have even higher SAT scores than\nthose granted automatic admission under the Top Ten Percent Law.154\nPerversely, this system negatively impacts minority students (who nationally\nhave lower standardized test scores) in the second decile of their classes at\ncompetitive high schools.            Grutter’s holistic look at race may soften this\nunreasonable exclusion of those second-decile minorities better qualified than\nmany of the non-minorities bluntly swept in under the Top Ten Percent Law.\nBut not much. It requires no empirical study to observe that those excluded\nunder this Law have been a rich source of Texas leaders over its history and that\nfor some applicants, admission to the flagship school of Texas is little more\npossible than admission to Harvard.155                That all of these weaknesses are\n\n       152\n             Gratz, 539 U.S. at 304 n.10 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n       153\n          In an effort to ameliorate this effect, a special provision of the Top Ten Percent Law\nprovides that “a high school magnet program, academy, or other special program” may be\nconsidered “an independent high school with its own graduating class separate from the\ngraduating class of other students attending the high school,” effectively allowing the school\nto certify two separate groups of Top Ten Percent Law students. See TEX . EDUC .

(Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 96, Tab 7) ¶ 12. For the class entering Fall 2008, after UT\noffered admission to top ten percent students, there were 1,216 admissions spots remaining.\n\n                                                44\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 45 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\napparent in the Top Ten Percent Law only make its focus upon race the\nplainer.156\n       The Top Ten Percent Law was adopted to increase minority enrollment.\nThat it has done, but its sweep of admissions is a polar opposite of the holistic\nfocus upon individuals.         Its internal proxies for race end-run the Supreme\nCourt’s studied structure for the use of race in university admissions decisions.\nIt casts aside testing historically relied upon, admitting many top ten percent\nminorities with significantly lower scores than rejected minorities and non-\nminorities alike.      That these admitted minorities are academically able to\nremain in the University does not respond to the reality that the Top Ten\nPercent Law eliminated the consideration of test scores, and correspondingly\nreduced academic selectivity, to produce increased enrollment of minorities.\nSuch costs may be intrinsic to affirmative action plans. If so, Grutter at least\n\n\n\n\n(The district court noted there were 841 places, but that number included the admission of so-\ncalled “Group A” applicants who have extremely high AI scores but are not in the top ten\npercent of their class. See id.) There were a total of 27,712 applicants for the fall class of\n2008. Statistical Handbook 2009–2010, at 25 tbl.S21. Neither the record nor any public\ninformation released by the University disclose what portion of that total applicant pool were\nTexas residents, but if we assume that proportion of applicants from Texas matches the 90%\nof admissions slots reserved for Texas applicants, one can estimate that there were 24,940\nTexas applicants. Subtracting the 8,984 students admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law\nyields an estimate of 15,956 applicants for 1,216 seats, or an acceptance rate of approximately\n7.6%. By comparison, the overall acceptance rate at Ivy League schools for the class entering\nFall 2008 ranged from 8% (Harvard) to 21% (Cornell). See The Rankings: Best National\nUniversities, U.S. NEW S & WORLD REP ., Sept. 2009, at 84–85.\n       156\n           Appellants here do not challenge the constitutionality of the Top Ten Percent Law.\nIn fact, they endorse it as a race-neutral alternative to the Grutter plan. A court considering\nthe constitutionality of the Law would examine whether Texas enacted the Law (and\ncorresponding admissions policies) because of its effects on identifiable racial groups or in spite\nof those effects. See Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979); cf. Brief of Social\nScientists Glenn C. Loury et al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents, Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), available at 2003 WL 402129, at *2, *9–*10 (noting that “it is\nnot clear that [percentage] plans are actually race-neutral” and that some amici counsel in\nGrutter “have signaled interest in moving on after this case to challenge these aspects of the\nTexas program”).\n\n                                               45\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 46 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nsought to minimize those costs through narrow tailoring. The Top Ten Percent\nLaw is anything but narrow.\n      In short, while the Top Ten Percent Law appears to succeed in its central\npurpose of increasing minority enrollment, it comes at a high cost and is at best\na blunt tool for securing the educational benefits that diversity is intended to\nachieve. We cannot fault UT’s contention that the Top Ten Percent Law is\nplainly not the sort of workable race-neutral alternative that would be a\nconstitutionally mandated substitute for race-conscious university admissions\npolicies. We are keenly aware that the University turned to the Top Ten Percent\nLaw in response to a judicial ruling. Yet we cannot agree that it is irrelevant.\nTo the contrary, that the Top Ten Percent Law, accounting for the vast majority\nof in-state admissions, threatens to erode the foundations UT relies on to justify\nimplementing Grutter policies is a contention not lacking in force. “Facially\nneutral” has a talismanic ring in the law, but it can be misleading. It is here.\n\n\n                                 VII. CRITICAL MASS\n      Appellants contend that UT’s decision to reintroduce race-conscious\nadmissions was unconstitutional because minority enrollment already met or\nexceeded “critical mass” when this decision was made, and thus any further\nfacial consideration of race was neither warranted nor constitutional.\nAppellants claim the best measure of whether UT had attained the benefits of\ndiversity is the raw percentage of minorities enrolled.       As a result of the\ncombined effects of changing demographics, targeted high school programs, and\nthe Top Ten Percent Law, total minority enrollment had increased over the\nyears. When the decision was made to reintroduce race-conscious admissions in\n2004, underrepresented minorities made up 21.4% of the incoming class (4.5%\nAfrican-American and 16.9% Hispanic).157\n\n\n      157\n            Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 593.\n\n                                              46\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 47 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\n      Although Texas was not constitutionally required to enact the Top Ten\nPercent Law, Appellants are correct that the decision to do so—and the\nsubstantial effect on aggregate minority enrollment at the University—places\nat risk UT’s race-conscious admissions policies. We are confident, and hold, that\na Grutter-style admissions system standing alone is constitutional. That said,\nwhether to overlay such a plan with the Top Ten Percent Law and how to\ncalibrate its flow presents a Hobson’s choice between the minority students it\ncontributes and the test of constitutional bounds it courts. True enough, the Top\nTen Percent Law is in a sense, perhaps a controlling sense, a “facially” race-\nneutral plan. But it was animated by efforts to increase minority enrollment,\nand to the extent it succeeds it is because at key points it proxies for race.\n\n\n                                         A\n      Appellants propose various baseline levels of diversity which, they suggest,\nwould fully satisfy the University’s interest in attaining critical mass. They first\nargue that if “from 13.5 to 20.1 percent” minority enrollment was adjudged to be\ngreat enough diversity each year by Michigan’s Law School in Grutter, then the\n21.4% minority enrollment that UT had achieved prior to reintroducing\nrace-conscious admissions must already have achieved critical mass. We find\nthis comparison inapt for numerous reasons.\n      Appellants’ comparison presumes that critical mass must have some fixed\nupper bound that applies across different schools, different degrees, different\nstates, different years, different class sizes, and different racial and ethnic\nsubcomposition. It is based on Appellants’ continued insistence that the concept\nof critical mass is defined by the minimum threshold for minority students to\nhave their ideas represented in class discussions and not to feel isolated or like\nspokespersons for their race. As we have discussed, Grutter firmly rejects that\npremise and defines critical mass by reference to a broader view of diversity.\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 48 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\n      At oral argument, Appellants qualified this insistence and wisely conceded\nthat what constitutes critical mass in the eyes of one school might not suffice at\nanother. Grutter concerned a law school, whereas Appellants challenge UT’s\nundergraduate program. Michigan’s Law School operates on a national level,\nwhile UT focuses on recruiting and producing future leaders for Texas. The law\nschool enrolled approximately 350 students in its first-year class, few enough\nstudents that diversity in the student body readily approximates diversity in the\nclassroom. In contrast, UT enrolls approximately 7,000 undergraduates in its\nfirst-year class and has data showing diversity rates vary widely across\nindividual classrooms. African-Americans and Hispanics never represented\nmore than a combined 14.8% of the Michigan Law School’s applicant pool during\nthe examined time period,158 while those same underrepresented minorities were\n28% of UT’s freshman applicant pool for Fall 2008.159\n      Appellants point to the Supreme Court’s observation in United States v.\nVirginia that the Virginia Military Institute “could achieve at least 10% female\nenrollment—a sufficient critical mass to provide the female cadets with a\npositive educational experience.”160 But this figure, even if accurate, covers only\none component of the multi-faceted concept of diversity elaborated in Grutter.\nIn any event, the claim that 10% minority enrollment is a ceiling to critical mass\nis confounded by Grutter.\n      Appellants lastly note that minority enrollment at UT now exceeds the\nlevel it had reached in the mid-1990s, pre-Hopwood, when the University was\nfree to obtain any critical mass it wanted through overtly race-based decisions.\nUT responds that it has consistently maintained, both in the 2004 Proposal and\nbefore this Court, that even before Hopwood it had never reached critical\n\n\n      158\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 384 tbls.1–2 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).\n      159\n            2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6 tbl.1.\n      160\n            518 U.S. 515, 523 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                               48\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 49 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nmass.161 While UT was making a greater use of race in that era, its pursuit of\ndiversity was constrained by other interests, such as admitting only\nwell-qualified students. We cannot assume that diversity levels immediately\nbefore Hopwood were indicative of critical mass. Moreover, minority enrollment\nin 1996 is not indicative of UT’s true pre-Hopwood diversity. While admissions\ndecisions in 1996 were not controlled by Hopwood, the case impacted enrollment,\nresulting in fewer minority students.                If one instead compares minority\nenrollment from 1989 to 2004, a different picture emerges. In 2004, UT enrolled\nsignificantly fewer African-Americans than it had in 1989 (309 compared to 380).\nIn addition, the 2004 entering class consisted of only 100 more Hispanics than\nthe 1989 class, a low number considering the vast increases in the Hispanic\npopulation of Texas.             Further, the 2004 Proposal demonstrated that the\npercentage of diverse classrooms had declined since 1996.162 The decrease in\nclassroom diversity will only continue if additional minority representation is not\nachieved, as the University plans to increase its number of course offerings in\nfuture years. Finally, whatever levels of minority enrollment sufficed more than\na decade ago may no longer constitute critical mass today, given the social\nchanges Texas has undergone during the intervening years.                 Appellants’\nproposed baselines are insufficient reason to doubt UT’s considered, good faith\nconclusion that “the University still has not reached a critical mass at the\nclassroom level.” 163\n      Grutter pointedly refused to tie the concept of “critical mass” to any fixed\nnumber. The Grutter Court approved of the University of Michigan Law School’s\ngoal of attaining critical mass even though the school had specifically abjured\n\n\n\n      161\n            See, e.g., 2004 Proposal at 24 (“[R]estoration to pre-Hopwood levels is not\nsufficient.”).\n      162\n            Id. at 25 & tbl.8.\n      163\n            Id. at 24 (quoted in Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 602).\n\n                                               49\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 50 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nany numerical target.164 The Court recounted how school officials had described\n“critical mass” only through abstract concepts such as “meaningful numbers,”\n“meaningful representation,” and “a number that encourages underrepresented\nminority students to participate in the classroom and not feel isolated.” 165 The\ntype of broad diversity Grutter approved does not lend itself to any fixed\nnumerical guideposts.\n        None of this is to say that Grutter left “critical mass” without objective\nmeaning. Rather, the legally cognizable interest—attaining a critical mass of\nunderrepresented minority students—“is defined by reference to the educational\nbenefits that diversity is designed to produce.”166 If a plaintiff produces evidence\nthat calls into question a university’s good faith pursuit of those educational\nbenefits, its race-conscious admissions policies may be found unconstitutional.\nWe are not persuaded, however, that any of the benchmarks suggested by\nAppellants succeed at calling that judgment into question.\n\n\n                                               B\n        As we have observed, benchmarks aside, UT’s claim that it has not yet\nachieved critical mass is less convincing when viewed against the backdrop of\nthe Top Ten Percent Law, which had already driven aggregate minority\nenrollment up to more than one-fifth of the University’s incoming freshman class\nbefore less subtle race-conscious admissions were reintroduced.\n        The chief difficulty with looking to aggregate minority enrollment is that\nit lumps together distinct minority groups from different backgrounds who may\nbring     various       unique    contributions    to   the   University   environment.\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students, for example, are not properly\n\n\n        164\n              Grutter, 539 U.S. at 318.\n        165\n              Id.\n        166\n              Id. at 330.\n\n                                              50\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 51 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\ninterchangeable for purposes of determining critical mass, and a university must\nbe sensitive to important distinctions within these broad groups. In Parents\nInvolved, the Supreme Court specifically faulted two school districts for\nemploying “only a limited notion of diversity” that lumped together very\ndifferent racial groups.167 One school district classified students exclusively as\n“white” or “nonwhite”; another labeled them as “black” or “other.” 168 This “binary\nconception of race” runs headlong into the central teaching of Grutter and other\nprecedents which instruct that a university must give serious and flexible\nconsideration to all aspects of diversity.169\n        On this record, we must conclude that the University has acted with\nappropriate sensitivity to these distinctions. Although the aggregate number of\nunderrepresented minorities may be large, the enrollment statistics for\nindividual groups when UT decided to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions\ndecisions does not indicate critical mass was achieved. Further, we recognize\nthat some year-to-year fluctuation in enrollment numbers is inevitable, so\nstatistics from any single year lack probative force; the University needs to\nmaintain critical mass in years when yield is low just as it does when yield is\nhigh.\n        It is also apparent that UT has given appropriate consideration to whether\naggregate minority enrollment is translating into adequate diversity in the\nclassroom. Through two separate studies, the 2004 Proposal reached a serious\nand good faith determination that the aggregate number overstates the\nUniversity’s true level of diverse interaction. UT sought to obtain the full\n\n\n\n\n        167\n              Parents Involved, 551 U.S. at 723.\n        168\n              Id. at 712, 716.\n        169\n         Id. at 735.

Pointing to the Supreme Court’s\nrecent decision in Parents Involved, they argue that the University’s use of race\nis unnecessary, and therefore not narrowly tailored, because it has only a\n“minimal effect.” The district court thought this was an attempt “to force UT\ninto an impossible catch-22: on the one hand, it is well-established that to be\nnarrowly tailored the means ‘must be specifically and narrowly framed to\naccomplish’ the compelling interest, but on the other hand, according to\n[Appellants], the ‘narrowly tailored’ plan must have more than a minimal\neffect.” 170\n        Parents Involved does not support the cost-benefit analysis that Appellants\nseek to invoke. Rather, Parents Involved was primarily a critique of the school\ndistricts’ “extreme approach” that used binary racial categories to classify\nschoolchildren.171 The Court referred to the “minimal effect” sought by this\npolicy as evidence that other, more narrowly tailored means would be effective\nto serve the school districts’ interests.172            The Court did not hold that a\nGrutter-like system would be impermissible even after race-neutral alternatives\nhave been exhausted because the gains are small. To the contrary, Justice\nKennedy—who provided the fifth vote in Parents Involved—wrote separately to\n\n\n\n\n        170\n              Fisher, 645 F.

CONCLUSION\n      Mindful of the time frame of this case, we cannot say that under the\ncircumstances before us UT breached its obligation to undertake a “serious, good\nfaith consideration” before resorting to race-conscious measures; yet we speak\nwith caution. In this dynamic environment, our conclusions should not be taken\nto mean that UT is immune from its obligation to recalibrate its dual systems of\nadmissions as needed, and we cannot bless the university’s race-conscious\nadmissions program in perpetuity. Rather, much like judicial approval of a\nstate’s redistricting of voter districts, it is good only until the next census\ncount—it is more a process than a fixed structure that we review. The\nUniversity’s formal and informal review processes will confront the stark fact\nthat the Top Ten Percent Law, although soon to be restricted to 75% of the\nincoming class, increasingly places at risk the use of race in admissions. In\n1998, those admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law accounted for 41% of the\nTexas residents in the freshman class, while in 2008, top ten percent students\ncomprised 81% of enrolled Texan freshmen.174 This trajectory evidences a risk\nof eroding the necessity of using race to achieve critical mass with accents that\nmay, if persisted in, increasingly present as an effort to meet quantitative goals\ndrawn from the demographics of race and a defiance of the now-demanded focus\nupon individuals when considering race.\n      A university may decide to pursue the goal of a diverse student body, and\nit may do so to the extent it ties that goal to the educational benefits that flow\nfrom diversity. The admissions procedures that UT adopted, modeled after the\n\n\n      173\n            Id. at 790 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).\n      174\n            2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 7 tbl.1a.\n\n                                               53\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 54 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\nplan approved by the Supreme Court in Grutter, are narrowly tailored—\nprocedures in some respects superior to the Grutter plan because the University\ndoes not keep a running tally of underrepresented minority representation\nduring the admissions process. We are satisfied that the University’s decision\nto reintroduce race-conscious admissions was adequately supported by the\n“serious, good faith consideration” required by Grutter. Finally, it is neither our\nrole nor purpose to dance from Grutter’s firm holding that diversity is an interest\nsupporting compelling necessity. Nor are we inclined to do so. The role of black\nathletes in the southern universities forty years ago presents diversity’s\npotential better than can we, although at that early juncture, it was ability\novercoming a barrier of race.175\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      175\n           See David K.

GARZA, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\n      Whenever a serious piece of judicial writing strays from fundamental\nprinciples of constitutional law, there is usually a portion of such writing where\nthose principles are articulated, but not followed. So it goes in Grutter, where\na majority of the Court acknowledged strict scrutiny as the appropriate level of\nreview for race-based preferences in university admissions, but applied a level\nof scrutiny markedly less demanding.        To be specific, race now matters in\nuniversity admissions, where, if strict judicial scrutiny were properly applied,\nit should not.\n      Today, we follow Grutter’s lead in finding that the University of Texas’s\nrace-conscious admissions program satisfies the Court’s unique application of\nstrict scrutiny in the university admissions context. I concur in the majority\nopinion, because, despite my belief that Grutter represents a digression in the\ncourse of constitutional law, today’s opinion is a faithful, if unfortunate,\napplication of that misstep. The Supreme Court has chosen this erroneous path\nand only the Court can rectify the error. In the meantime, I write separately to\nunderscore this detour from constitutional first principles.\n                                        I\n      The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that\nno State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of\nthe laws.” U.S. C ONST. amend. XIV. One of the Amendment’s “core principles”\nis to “do away with all governmentally imposed discriminations based on race,”\nPalmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432 (1984), and to create “a Nation of equal\ncitizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and\nachievement.” Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 505–06 (1988). This\nis why “[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and .\n. . call for the most exacting judicial examination.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S.\n900, 904 (1995) (quoting Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 291\n(1978) (opinion of Powell, J.)). It matters not whether the racial preference is\n\n                                       56\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 57 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\ncharacterized as invidious or benign: strict scrutiny applies regardless of “the\nrace of those burdened or benefitted by a particular classification.” Shaw v.\nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 650–51 (1993) (quoting Croson, 488 U.S. at 494). To survive\nsuch exacting scrutiny, laws classifying citizens on the basis of race must be\n“narrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest.” Miller, 515 U.S. at\n904.\n       In Grutter, the majority acknowledged these fundamental principles, see\nGrutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 326–27 (2003), but then departed and held,\nfor the first time, that racial preferences in university admissions could be used\nto serve a compelling state interest. Id. at 328. Though the Court recognized\nthat strict scrutiny should govern the inquiry into the use of race in university\nadmissions, id. at 326, what the Court applied in practice was something else\nentirely.\n                                               A\n       The Grutter majority asserts that “[s]trict scrutiny is not ‘strict in theory,\nbut fatal in fact.’” 539 U.S. at 326 (quoting Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,\n515 U.S. 200, 237 (1995)). But since the Court began applying strict scrutiny to\nreview governmental uses of race in discriminating between citizens, the number\nof cases in which the Court has permitted such uses can be counted on one\nhand.1 The Court has rejected numerous intuitively appealing justifications\noffered for racial discrimination, such as remedying general societal\n\n\n       1\n         See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328 (recognizing racial diversity “in the context of higher\neducation” as compelling); Freeman v.

United\nStates, 323 U.S. 214, 216 (1944) (“[P]ressing public necessity may sometimes justify the\nexistence of [racial discrimination]; racial antagonism never can.”). In Fullilove v. Klutznick,\n448 U.S. 448 (1980), the Court upheld a federal law that set aside public works monies for\nminority-owned businesses. Although Fullilove has not been expressly overruled, it is unlikely\nthat its holding survives the Court’s later Equal Protection decisions. See ERWIN\nCHEMERINSKY, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES § 9.3.5, at 738, 742–43 (3d\ned. 2006). Korematsu’s authority is likewise suspect.\n\n                                              57\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 58 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\ndiscrimination, see Croson, 488 U.S. at 496–98 (plurality opinion); enhancing the\nnumber of minority professionals available to work in underserved minority\ncommunities, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 310–11 (opinion of Powell, J.); and providing\nrole models for minority students, see Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S.\n267, 275–76 (1986) (plurality opinion). In all of these cases, the Court found that\nthe policy goals offered were insufficiently compelling to justify discrimination\nbased on race.\n      In those rare cases where the use of race properly furthered a compelling\nstate interest, the Court has emphasized that the means chosen must “work the\nleast harm possible,” Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.), and be\nnarrowly tailored to fit the interest “with greater precision than any alternative\nmeans.”   Grutter, 539 U.S. at 379 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (quotation\nomitted). Moreover, the failure to consider available race-neutral alternatives\nand employ them if efficacious would cause a program to fail strict scrutiny. See\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 280 n.6 (plurality opinion) (the “term ‘narrowly tailored’ .\n. . requires consideration of whether lawful alternative and less restrictive\nmeans could have been used.”); see also Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237–38; Croson,\n488 U.S. at 507; Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 537 (1980) (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (“Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but\nthe most exact connection between justification and classification.”).\n      Beyond the use of race-neutral alternatives, the Court, pre-Grutter, had\nconsidered several other factors in determining whether race-conscious programs\nwere narrowly tailored. Programs employing a quota system would fail this\ninquiry, as would programs of unlimited duration. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at\n315–18; Croson, 488 U.S. at 498. The Court looked to a program’s flexibility and\nits capacity for individualized consideration. See United States v. Paradise, 480\nU.S. 149, 177 (1987) (plurality opinion); Croson, 488 U.S. at 508. The Court also\nconsidered the relationship between the numerical goal and the percentage of\n\n                                        58\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 59 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\nminority group members in the relevant population, and whether the means\nchosen were likely to be overinclusive. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 506–10. Finally,\nthe Court considered the program’s burden on innocent third parties. See, e.g.,\nMetro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547, 630 (1990) (O’Connor, J., dissenting)\n(programs should not “unduly burden individuals who are not members of the\nfavored racial and ethnic groups”); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n      Grutter changed this. After finding that racial diversity at the University\nof Michigan Law School (“Law School”) was a compelling governmental interest,\nthe Court redefined the meaning of narrow tailoring. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n387 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“The Court, however, does not apply strict\nscrutiny. By trying to say otherwise, it undermines both the test and its own\ncontrolling precedents.”); see generally Ian Ayres & Sydney Foster, Don’t Tell,\nDon’t Ask: Narrow Tailoring After Grutter and Gratz, 85 T EX . L. R EV. 517\n(2007). The Court replaced narrow tailoring’s conventional “least restrictive\nmeans” requirement with a regime that encourages opacity and is incapable of\nmeaningful judicial review under any level of scrutiny. Courts now simply\nassume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that university\nadministrators have acted in good faith in pursuing racial diversity, and courts\nare required to defer to their educational judgments on how best to achieve it.\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 328–29. What is more, the deference called for in Grutter\nseems to allow universities, rather than the courts, to determine when the use\nof racial preferences is no longer compelling. See id. at 343 (“We take the Law\nSchool at its word that it would ‘like nothing better than to find a race-neutral\nadmissions formula’ and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program\nas soon as practicable.”). This new species of strict scrutiny ensures that only\nthose admissions programs employing the most heavy-handed racial preferences,\nand those programs foolish enough to maintain and provide conclusive data, will\nbe subject to “exacting judicial examination.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 904. Others,\n\n                                        59\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 60 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\nlike the University of Michigan in Grutter, and the University of Texas here, can\nget away with something less.\n                                         B\n      Setting aside for a moment Grutter’s finding that racial diversity within\nthe Law School was a compelling state interest, see infra Sections I.D and III, I\nfind troubling the Court’s treatment of whether the Law School’s chosen\nmeans—using race as a “plus” factor—was narrowly tailored to achieving that\nend. The Court discussed five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored race-conscious\nadmissions program in answering this question: (1) the absence of quotas; (2) a\nprogram that does not unduly harm any racial group; (3) serious, good-faith\nconsideration of race-neutral alternatives; (4) a program that contains a sunset\nprovision or some logical end point; and (5) individualized consideration of all\napplicants. See 539 U.S. at 335–43. The Court’s opinion effectively emptied at\nleast three of these criteria of their probative content, leaving the first and fifth\nas determinative in any narrow tailoring inquiry. See Ayres & Foster, 85 T EX.\nL. R EV. at 543.\n      First, Grutter defined a quota as reserving a fixed number or percentage\nof opportunities for certain minority groups, and insulating individuals from\nthose groups from competition with all other candidates for available seats. Id.\nat 333–36. These prohibitions were clear well before Grutter. See Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 317; Croson, 488 U.S. at 496. Only those programs with overt numerical\nset-asides or separate minority admissions tracks would fail this requirement.\n      Next, the Court found that race-conscious admissions programs do not\nunduly burden innocent third parties so long as they provide individualized\nconsideration. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341 (“[I]n the context of its individualized\ninquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law\nSchool’s race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 61 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\napplicants.”). Here, the Court collapsed the second narrow tailoring criterion\ninto the fifth.\n      Grutter also held that there were no workable race-neutral alternatives at\nthe Law School, such as “using a lottery system” or “decreasing the emphasis for\nall applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.” Id. at 340. The Court\nlikewise rejected the United States’ argument that the Law School’s plan was\nnot narrowly tailored because race-neutral alternatives that had proven effective\nelsewhere (i.e., the percentage plans utilized in California, Florida, and Texas)\nwere available and would deliver the educational benefits the Law School was\nseeking. Id. The Court held that “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion\nof every conceivable race-neutral alternative. . . . Narrow tailoring does,\nhowever, require serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.” Id. at 339.\nAfter Grutter, universities are no longer required to use the most effective race-\nneutral means. So long as admissions officials have given “serious, good faith\nconsideration” to such programs, they are free to pursue less effective\nalternatives that serve the interest “about as well.” Id. (citing Wygant, 476 U.S.\nat 280 n.6 (plurality opinion)). Thus, this third criterion is now essentially\nwithout meaning. Given the deference that universities’ educational judgments\nare to be afforded post-Grutter, “serious, good faith consideration” is a peculiarly\nlow bar that will be satisfied in most every case. Compare id. at 339 (narrow\ntailoring “require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives”), with id. at 329 (“[G]ood faith on the part of a university is\n‘presumed’ absent a showing to the contrary.”) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n      Finally, while the Court acknowledged that race-conscious admissions\nprograms must be limited in time, such as by sunset provisions or periodic\nreviews to determine whether the preferences remain necessary, the Court\n\n                                        61\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 62 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\nsuspended application of this criterion for twenty-five years. Id. at 343 (“We\nexpect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be\nnecessary to further the interest approved today.”). In doing so, the Grutter\nmajority simply accepted the Law School’s promise that it would terminate its\nrace-conscious policies as soon as possible. See id. at 343 (“We take the Law\nSchool at its word that it would ‘like nothing better than to find a race-neutral\nadmissions formula’ and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program\nas soon as practicable.”). The Court’s approval here is remarkable given the\nconstitutional gravity of this experiment (i.e., the Law School’s allocation of\npreferences along racial lines). This fourth criterion will now be considered\nsatisfied with little or no showing on the part of university administrators, at\nleast until 2028.\n      And thus, all that truly remains of strict scrutiny’s narrow tailoring\ninquiry post-Grutter is the requirement of “individualized consideration.” But\nwhat does this term mean specifically? Grutter never tells us. Moreover, the\nweight given to race as part of this individualized consideration is purposefully\nleft undefined, making meaningful judicial review all but impossible.\n                                       C\n      In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law School sought to achieve a\nstudent body that was both academically strong and diverse along several\ndimensions, including race. There, the Court endorsed the Law School’s “highly\nindividualized, holistic review    of each applicant’s file, giving serious\nconsideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse\neducational environment.” Id. at 337. The Court noted approvingly that the\nLaw School had “no policy . . . of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any\nsingle ‘soft’ variable.” Id. The Grutter majority permitted the use of race and\n\n\n\n\n                                       62\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 63 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nethnicity as “plus” factors within the Law School’s holistic review, but this\nsimply raises the question: how much of a plus?2 Grutter did not say.\n       Instead, the Court implicitly forbade universities from quantifying racial\npreferences in their admissions calculus. Contrasting the admissions system\nfound unconstitutional in Gratz, the Grutter majority noted that “the Law School\nawards no mechanical, predetermined diversity ‘bonuses’ based on race or\nethnicity.” Id. (citing Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244, 271–72 (2003)). On this\nview, rigid point systems that allocate preference points for racial and ethnic\nstatus are unconstitutional because they “preclude[] admissions counselors from\nconducting the type of individualized consideration the Court’s opinion in\nGrutter requires.” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 277 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (citation\nomitted).\n       But it is not clear, to me at least, how using race in the holistic scoring\nsystem approved in Grutter is constitutionally distinct from the point-based\nsystem rejected in Gratz.3 If two applicants, one a preferred minority and one\nnonminority, with application packets identical in all respects save race would\nbe assigned the same score under a holistic scoring system, but one gets a higher\nscore when race is factored in, how is that different from the mechanical group-\nbased boost prohibited in Gratz? Although one system quantifies the preference\n\n\n       2\n        The Court’s discussion of race as a “plus” factor takes place in the context of strict\nscrutiny’s narrow tailoring inquiry. Whether race should be considered at all is a separate,\nmore fundamental, matter. See infra Section III.\n       3\n         Although I do not believe the government’s use of race in university admissions can\never serve a compelling interest, assuming that it can, there is no reason why a well-designed\npoint system could not account for an applicant’s race, among other variables, and yet still\nprovide meaningful, individualized consideration. See Ayres & Foster, 85 TEX. L. REV. at\n566–70; see also Gratz, 539 U.S. at 295 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[I]t is hard to see what is\ninappropriate in assigning some stated value to a relevant characteristic, whether it be\nreasoning ability, writing style, running speed, or minority race. Justice Powell’s plus factors\nnecessarily are assigned some values. The college simply does by a numbered scale what the\nlaw school accomplishes in its ‘holistic review’; the distinction does not imply that applicants\nto the undergraduate college are denied individualized consideration . . . .” (citation omitted)).\n\n                                               63\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 64 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nand the other does not, the result is the same: a determinative benefit based on\nrace.\n        Grutter’s new terminology like “individualized consideration” and “holistic\nreview” tends to conceal this result. By obscuring the University of Michigan’s\nuse of race in these diffuse tests, the Court allowed the Law School to do covertly\nwhat the undergraduate program could not do overtly. See Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n270–76.     This much is clear and has been discussed elsewhere.4                    I write\nseparately to add my view, confirmed while deciding this appeal, that Grutter’s\nnarrow      tailoring   inquiry—now        reduced     to   testing   for   individualized\nconsideration—is incapable of meaningful judicial review.\n        Traditionally, strict scrutiny required that the overall benefits of programs\nemploying racial classifications justified the overall costs.5 See Ayres & Foster,\n85 T EX. L. R EV. at 526 & n.38. In Grutter, not only did the Court fail to conduct\nsuch an analysis, it rejected the only means for measuring the constitutionally\nrelevant costs and benefits. Id. Although I disagree with the Court that race-\nconscious policies can ever serve a compelling interest in university admissions,\nby prohibiting race and ethnicity from being quantified at all, Grutter eliminated\nany chance for courts to critically evaluate whether race is, in fact, the defining\nfeature of an admissions packet. Post-Grutter, there is no way to assess how\nmuch of a “plus” race gets as a plus-factor in any admissions system. And\nwithout the ability to measure the number of “but-for” admits (i.e., admitted\nminority students for whom race was the decisive factor), courts cannot\n\n\n\n        4\n        See, e.g., Larry Alexander & Maimon Schwarzschild, Grutter or Otherwise: Racial\nPreferences and Higher Education, 21 CONST. COMMENT. 3 (2004); CHEMERINSKY,\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW 744.\n        5\n         For example, a race-conscious admissions policy that added just one, three, or five\nmembers of a preferred minority group to an enrolling class of 6,700 would fail to be narrowly\ntailored. Such a program would have an intolerably high cost for little return. See infra\nSection II.\n\n                                             64\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 65 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nmeaningfully evaluate whether a university’s use of race fits its asserted interest\nnarrowly. See id. at 527–41, 575–82.6 In short, it is impossible to subject such\nuses of race to strict scrutiny.        Grutter rewards admissions programs that\nremain opaque.\n       Even assuming the Court’s “educational benefits of diversity” justification\nholds true, see infra Section I.D, there are far more effective race-neutral means\nof screening for the educational benefits that states like Michigan and Texas\nostensibly seek. To the degree that state universities genuinely desire students\nwith diverse backgrounds and experiences, race-neutral factors like specific\nhardships overcome, extensive travel, leadership positions held, volunteer and\nwork experience, dedication to particular causes, and extracurricular activities,\namong many other variables, can be articulated with specificity in the\nadmissions essays.7 These markers for viewpoint diversity are far more likely\nto translate into enhanced classroom dialogue than a blanket presumption that\nrace will do the same. Moreover, these markers represent the kind of life\nexperiences that reflect industry. Race cannot. While race inevitably colors an\nindividual’s life and views, that facet of race and its impact on the individual can\nbe described with some precision through an admissions essay. We should not\n\n\n\n       6\n        See also id. at 528 n.42 (citing, inter alia, WILLIAM G. BOWEN & DEREK BOK, THE\nSHAPE OF THE RIVER: LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF CONSIDERING RACE IN COLLEGE AND\nUNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS 31–39 (1998)) (observing that the degree of racial preferences can be\nmeasured by examining the number of but-for admits and the qualification differentials\nbetween but-for admits and nonpreferred applicants who would have been admitted in the\nabsence of affirmative action).\n       7\n        In addition to the two essays that UT requires as part of each application packet, the\nUniversity considers several of the factors described above in determining an applicant’s\npersonal achievement score. See Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 645 F. Supp. 2d 587, 597\n(W.D. Tex. 2009) (“The third [Personal Achievement Index] element is the personal\nachievement score, which is based on an evaluation of the file in its entirety by senior\nmembers of the admissions staff. The evaluators conduct a holistic review considering the\napplicant’s demonstrated leadership qualities, extracurricular activities, awards and honors,\nwork experience, service to the school or community, and special circumstances.”).\n\n                                             65\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 66 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\npresume that race shapes everyone’s experiences in the same ways and award\npreference (or a bonus, or a “plus”) accordingly. Such a policy, however labeled,\nis not narrowly tailored.\n      Finally, the Court’s unusual deference to educators’ academic judgments\nthat racial diversity is a compelling interest, coupled with the deference\nallegedly owed to their determination of when the use of race is no longer\nnecessary, see id. at 343, would appear to permit race-based policies indefinitely.\nFor example, notwithstanding that a university’s race-conscious policies had\nachieved 25% African-American and 25% Hispanic enrollment in the student\nbody generally, that university could still justify the use of race in admissions\nif these minority students were disproportionately bunched in a small number\nof classes or majors. In fact, the majority’s application of Grutter today reaches\njust such a result.\n      Despite Top Ten Percent’s demonstrable impact on minority enrollment\nat the University of Texas, the majority opinion holds that the University’s use\nof race in admissions can be justified by reference to the paucity of minority\nstudents in certain majors:\n      While the [Top Ten Percent] Law may have contributed to an\n      increase in overall minority enrollment, those minority students\n      remain clustered in certain programs, severely limiting the\n      beneficial effects of educational diversity. For example, nearly a\n      quarter of the undergraduate students in UT’s College of Social\n      Work are Hispanic, and more than 10% are African-American. In\n      the College of Education, 22.4% of students are Hispanic and 10.1%\n      are African-American. By contrast, in the College of Business\n      Administration, only 14.5% of the students are Hispanic and 3.4%\n      are African-American. It is evident that if UT is to have diverse\n      interactions, it needs more minority students who are interested in\n      and meet the requirements for a greater variety of colleges, not\n      more students disproportionately enrolled in certain programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        66\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 67 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\nAnte at 42. If this is so, a university’s asserted interested in racial diversity\ncould justify race-conscious policies until such time as educators certified that\nthe elusive critical mass had finally been attained, not merely in the student\nbody generally, but major-by-major and classroom-by-classroom.\n      Given the “large-scale absence of African-American and Hispanic students\nfrom thousands of classes” at the University of Texas, Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at\n607, today’s decision ratifies the University’s reliance on race at the\ndepartmental and classroom levels, and will, in practice, allow for race-based\npreferences in seeming perpetuity. Such a use of race “has no logical stopping\npoint” and is not narrowly tailored. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 498 (citing Wygant,\n476 U.S. at 275). Allowing race-based social engineering at the university level\nis one thing, but not nearly as invasive as condoning it at the classroom level.\nI cannot accept that the Fourteenth Amendment permits this level of granularity\nto justify dividing students along racial lines.\n                                         D\n      The same imprecision that characterizes Grutter’s narrow tailoring\nanalysis casts doubt on its discussion of racial diversity as a compelling state\ninterest.   Grutter found that the Law School had a compelling interest in\n“securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body,” and that achieving\na “critical mass” of racially diverse students was necessary to accomplish that\ngoal. Id. at 333. The Law School defined “critical mass” as “a number that\nencourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom\nand not feel isolated . . . or like spokespersons for their race.” Id. at 318–19. The\nCourt clarified: “critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits\nthat diversity is designed to produce.” Id. at 330. Justice O’Connor’s majority\nopinion identified three such constitutionally relevant benefits: (i) increased\nperspective in the classroom; (ii) improved professional training; and (iii)\nenhanced civic engagement. Id. at 330–33. The first element is based on Justice\n\n                                         67\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 68 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nPowell’s focus in Bakke on the campus-level benefits of diversity. The second two\nare new.8\n       My difficulty with Grutter’s “educational benefits of diversity” discussion\nis that it remains suspended at the highest levels of hypothesis and speculation.\nAnd unlike ordinary hypotheses, which must be testable to be valid, Grutter’s\nthesis is incapable of testing. Justice O’Connor’s majority opinion rests almost\nentirely on intuitive appeal rather than concrete evidence.\n                                               1\n       The first constitutionally relevant benefit that makes up Grutter’s\ncompelling interest is racial diversity’s direct impact in the classroom. Here, the\nCourt concluded that diverse perspectives improve the overall quality of\neducation because “classroom discussion is livelier, more spirited, and simply\nmore enlightening and interesting when students have the greatest possible\nvariety of backgrounds.” Id. at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted). This\nrationale conforms to Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke that universities should\npursue “[t]he atmosphere of speculation, excitement and creation” that is\n“promoted by a diverse student body.” 438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.).9\nI question the validity of this surmise.\n\n       8\n         See Robert C. Post, The Supreme Court, 2002 Term—Forward: Fashioning the Legal\nConstitution: Culture, Courts, and Law, 117 HARV. L. REV. 4, 59–60 (2003) (“Although Grutter\ncasts itself as merely endorsing Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke, Grutter’s analysis of\ndiversity actually differs quite dramatically from Powell’s. Powell conceptualized diversity as\na value intrinsic to the educational process itself. He regarded diversity as essential to ‘the\nquality of higher education,’ because education was a practice of enlightenment, ‘of\nspeculation, experiment, and creation,’ that thrived on the ‘robust exchange of ideas;\ncharacteristically provoked by confrontation between persons of distinct life experiences. . .\n.

REV. at 578 n.215 (citing commentary).\n       9\n         Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke conspicuously avoided claiming a categorical\neducational benefit of diversity, asserting only the potential for such benefits.

By polling students and professors, as the University of Texas has\ndone?10    How would we know whether the substantial social harm we are\ntolerating by dividing students based on race is worth the cost? That classroom\ndiscussion is, in fact, being enhanced? How can a party prove that it is? How\ncan an opposing party prove that it is not?\n       My concern with allowing viewpoint diversity’s alleged benefits to justify\nracial preference is that viewpoint diversity is too theoretical and abstract. It\ncannot be proved or disproved. Sure, the Grutter majority cited to expert reports\nand amicus briefs from corporate employers as evidence that student body\ndiversity improves educational outcomes and better prepares students for the\nworkforce.

But this support can be easily manipulated.11 If all a\nuniversity “need do is find . . . report[s],” studies, or surveys to implement a race-\nconscious admissions policy, “the constraints of the Equal Protection Clause will,\nin effect, have been rendered a nullity.” Croson, 488 U.S. at 504; see also J.E.B.\nv. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 139 n.11 (1994) (“[C]lassifications that rest\non impermissible stereotypes violate the Equal Protection Clause, even when\nsome statistical support can be conjured up for the generalizations.”). Grutter\npermits race-based preferences on nothing more than intuition—the type that\nstrict scrutiny is designed to protect against. See 539 U.S. at 327 (“Absent\nsearching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, we\nhave no way to determine what classifications are benign or remedial and what\n\n\n\n\n      10\n        Every measure of social benefit or harm would be subjective and, at worst, capable\nof manipulation through framing biases.\n      11\n        See Alexander & Schwarzschild, 21 CONST. COMMENT. at 5 n.9 (criticizing the Court’s\nundue reliance on amicus briefs from corporate employers).\n\n                                            69\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 70 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nclassifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority\nor simple racial politics.”) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n       Grutter and Bakke err by simply assuming that racial diversity begets\ngreater viewpoint diversity. This inference is based on the assumption that\nmembers of minority groups, because of their racial status, are likely to have\nunique experiences and perspectives incapable of expression by individuals from\noutside that group. But as the Court has recognized elsewhere, the Constitution\nprohibits state decisionmakers from presuming that groups of individuals,\nwhether classified by race, ethnicity, or gender, share such a quality collectively.\nSee Miller, 515 U.S. at 914 (the Equal Protection Clause forbids “the demeaning\nnotion that members of the defined racial groups ascribe to certain ‘minority\nviews’ that must be different from those of other citizens.”) (citation omitted).\nThere is no one African-American or Hispanic viewpoint,12 and, in fact, Grutter\napproved the Law School’s diversity rationale precisely because of the role that\nracial diversity can play in dispelling such falsehoods. See id. at 320 (citing\nexpert testimony suggesting that “when a critical mass of underrepresented\nminority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because\nnonminority students learn there is no ‘minority viewpoint’ but rather a variety\nof viewpoints among minority students.”); and id. at 333 (“[D]iminishing the\nforce of such stereotypes is a crucial part of the Law School’s mission, and one\nthat it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.”).\n\n\n\n       12\n          For example, life experiences differ significantly if a Hispanic student’s ethnicity\noriginates in Mexico as opposed to Spain, or, for that matter, any of various Central and South\nAmerican countries. Likewise, an African-American student whose roots come from Nigeria\nwould be distinct in culture and ethnicity from a student whose ancestry originated in Egypt\nor Haiti. This same principle applies for students from non-preferred racial classes. For\nexample, second-generation students from English, Irish, Scottish, or Australian ancestry\nwould come with very different cultural experiences, and yet all of these students would be\ngrouped together as “White” in racial classification systems like the one used at the University\nof Texas.\n\n                                              70\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 71 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\n      Grutter sought to have it both ways. The Court held that racial diversity\nwas necessary to eradicate the notion that minority students think and behave,\nnot as individuals, but as a race. At the same time, the Court approved a policy\ngranting race-based preferences on the assumption that racial status correlates\nwith greater diversity of viewpoints.\n                                        2\n      Grutter’s second asserted educational benefit of diversity relates to\nimproved professional training. Here, Justice O’Connor writes that diversity\n“promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes,\nand enables students to better understand persons of different races.” Id. at 330\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Such training is essential, the\nargument goes, for future leaders who will eventually work within and supervise\na racially diverse workforce. Id. at 330–31.\n      State universities are free to define their educational goals as broadly as\nneeded to serve the public interest.         We defer to educators’ professional\njudgments in setting those goals. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328 (“Our holding today\nis in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university’s\nacademic decisions, within constitutionally proscribed limits.”). My concern,\ndiscussed throughout this opinion, is not that Grutter commands such deference,\nbut that it conflated the deference owed to a university’s asserted interest with\ndeference to the means used to attain it. See id. at 388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)\n(“The Court confuses deference to a university’s definition of its educational\nobjective with deference to the implementation of this goal.”).\n      There is, however, one aspect of the Court’s “improved professional\ntraining” rationale that I find especially troubling. While Grutter made much\nof the role that educational institutions play in providing professional training,\nsee id. at 331 (“We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of\npreparing students for work and citizenship”), the cases the Court relied on\n\n                                        71\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 72 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\ninvolved primary and secondary schools. See id. (citing Plyer v. Doe, 457 U.S.\n202, 221 (1982) (describing education as pivotal to “sustaining our political and\ncultural heritage”) and ibid. (citing Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493\n(1954) (“education . . . is the very foundation of good citizenship.”)). I question\nwhether these cases apply with equal force in the context of higher education,\nwhere academic goals are vastly different from those pursued in elementary and\nsecondary schools. Moreover, a university’s self-styled educational goals, for\nexample, promoting “cross-racial understanding” and enabling students “to\nbetter understand persons of different races,” could just as easily be facilitated\nin many other public settings where diverse people assemble regularly: in the\nworkplace, in primary and secondary schools, and in social and community\ngroups. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 347–48 (Scalia, J., dissenting). I do not believe\nthat the university has a monopoly on furthering these societal goals, or even\nthat the university is in the best position to further such goals. Notwithstanding\nan institution’s decision to expand its educational mission more broadly, the\nuniversity’s core function is to educate students in the physical sciences,\nengineering, social sciences, business and the humanities, among other academic\ndisciplines.\n                                         3\n      Finally, Grutter articulated a third benefit of racial diversity in higher\neducation: enhancing civic engagement. Here, the Court wrote that:\n      Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in\n      the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation,\n      indivisible, is to be realized.\n      ...\n      In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of\n      the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly\n      open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and\n      ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have\n      confidence in the openness and integrity of educational institutions\n      that provide this training. . . . Access to [higher] education . . . must\n\n                                         72\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 73 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and\n       ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may\n       participate in the educational institutions that provide the training\n       and education necessary to succeed in America.\n\nId. at 332–33.\n       Unlike the first two “educational benefits of diversity,” which focused on\nimproving classroom discussion and professional training, this third claimed\nbenefit plainly has nothing to do with the university’s core education and\ntraining functions. Instead, Grutter is concerned here with role that higher\neducation plays in a democratic society, and the Court suggests that affirmative\naction at public universities can advance a societal goal of encouraging minority\nparticipation in civic life.13 This proposition lacks foundation.\n       If a significant portion of a minority community sees our nation’s leaders\nas illegitimate or lacks confidence in the integrity of our educational institutions,\nas Grutter posits in the block quote above, see id., 539 U.S. at 332, I doubt that\nsuspending the prevalent constitutional rules to allow preferred treatment for\nas few as 15-40 students, see infra Section II, is likely to foster renewed civic\nparticipation from among that community as a whole.14\n       Grutter replaced Bakke’s emphasis on diversity in educational inputs with\na new emphasis on diversity in educational outputs. By expanding Justice\n\n\n       13\n          See Lani Guinier, The Supreme Court, 2002 Term—Comment: Admissions Rituals\nas Political Acts: Guardians at the Gates of Our Democratic Ideals, 117 HARV. L. REV. 113,\n174–76 (2003).\n       14\n          This is not to criticize universities, like the University of Texas, for implementing\npolicies that seek to increase minority representation, not merely for its educational benefits\non campus, but also for the secondary benefits that such increases in minority enrollment can\nhave in the workplace and in society generally. A university degree confers professional and\nleadership opportunities unavailable otherwise, and ensuring that all segments of society have\nmeaningful access to public institutions of higher education “represents a paramount\ngovernment objective.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331–32 (citing Brief of United States as Amicus\nCuriae 13). I do not question this goal, but rather the constitutionality of using race to attain\nit.\n\n                                               73\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 74 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\nPowell’s original viewpoint diversity rationale to include diversity’s putative\nbenefits in the workforce and beyond (i.e., inspiring a sense of civic belonging in\ndiscouraged minority communities), the Court has endorsed a compelling\ninterest without bounds.       Post-Grutter, it matters little whether racial\npreferences in university admissions are justified by reference to their potential\nfor improved discussion in individual classrooms, or even at the university\ngenerally. Now such preferences can be justified based on their global impact.\nBy removing the focus of attention from diversity’s educational value at the\ncampus level, the Court has ensured that the “educational benefits of diversity”\nwill accommodate all university affirmative action plans as compelling.\n                                         E\n      Finally, by using metaphors, like “critical mass,” and indefinite terms that\nlack conceptual or analytical precision, but rather sound in abject subjectivity,\nto dress up constitutional standards, Grutter fails to provide any predictive value\nto courts and university administrators tasked with applying these standards\nconsistently. And notwithstanding the Court’s nod to federalism, Grutter’s\nambiguity discourages States from experimenting or departing from the one\naccepted norm. See id. at 342 (citing United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 581\n(1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[T]he States may perform their role as\nlaboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best\nsolution is far from clear.”)). In the absence of clear guidance, public universities\nnationwide will simply model their programs after the one approved in Grutter\nrather than struggle with the risks and uncertain benefits of experimentation.\nThat is exactly what has occurred here. With one exception—the Top Ten\nPercent law—the race-conscious admissions policy that we review today is\nidentical to the program used at the Law School.\n\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 75 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\n                                            II\n       As mentioned at the outset, I concur in the opinion because I believe\ntoday’s decision is a faithful application of Grutter’s teachings, however flawed\nI may find those teachings to be. I am compelled to follow the Court’s unusual\ndeference towards public university administrators in their assessment that\nracial diversity is a compelling interest, as well as the Court’s refashioned\nnarrow-tailoring inquiry. See 28 U.S.C. § 453. My difficulty is not necessarily\nwith today’s decision, but with the one that drives it. Nonetheless, there is one\naspect of Judge Higginbotham’s thoughtful opinion that gives me pause about\nwhether Grutter compels the result we reach today. Ultimately, and regrettably,\nI recognize that the deference called for by Grutter may make this concern\nsuperfluous.\n       As today’s opinion notes, the University of Texas’s race-conscious\nadmissions policy is nearly indistinguishable from the program approved by the\nSupreme Court in Grutter.15        Ante at 2, 4, 25. As such, the majority opinion\nsummarily finds that, like the Law School in Grutter, the University of Texas\nhas a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits of diversity in its\nundergraduate program. Id. at 26. After affording all deference due, today’s\ndecision focuses on the efficacy of the University’s race-conscious admissions\npolicy. Id. at 29 (“[W]hile we focus on the University’s decision to adopt a\nGrutter-like plan, admissions outcomes remain relevant evidence of the plan’s\nnecessity—a reality check.”). In my view, the efficacy of the University’s race-\nbased admissions policy is more than merely relevant, it is dispositive.\n       The plaintiffs here argue that the University of Texas’s interest in\nobtaining a racially diverse student body is not compelling because the\nUniversity has already achieved critical mass by way of Texas’s Top Ten Percent\n\n      15\n        As a result, UT’s policy suffers from all the same defects as the Law School policy\nevaluated in Grutter and discussed previously in this opinion. See supra Section I.\n\n                                            75\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 76 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nlaw. See T EX. E DUC. C ODE § 51.803 (1997). The University disagrees. This\nclaim is difficult to evaluate. The University refuses to assign a weight to race\nor to maintain conclusive data on the degree to which race factors into\nadmissions decisions and enrollment yields. See Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at\n608–09 (“At no point in the process is race considered individually or given a\nnumerical value; instead, the file is evaluated in its entirety in order to provide\na better understanding of the student as a person and place her achievements\nin context.”). Whether the University of Texas’s use of race is narrowly tailored\nturns on whether its chosen means—using race as a plus factor in the\nUniversity’s holistic scoring system—are effective, not just in theory, but also in\npractice.\n       If, apart from the Top Ten Percent law, the University of Texas’s race-\nconscious admissions program added just three-to-five African-American\nstudents, or five-to-ten Hispanic students, to an entering freshman class of\n6,700, that policy would completely fail to achieve its aims and would not be\nnarrowly tailored. See Ayres & Foster, 85 T EX. L. R EV. at 523 n.27 (“At least as\na theoretical matter, narrow tailoring requires not only that the preferences not\nbe too large, but also that they not be too small so as to fail to achieve the goals\nof the relevant compelling government interest.”). The marginal benefit of\nadding just five or ten minority students to a class of this size would be\nnegligible and have no perceptible impact on the “educational benefits that\ndiversity is designed to produce.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (“[C]ritical mass is\ndefined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to\nproduce.”).16 This is especially so, if, as the district court suggests, “the large-\n\n\n       16\n         See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316 (opinion of Powell, J.)

Supp. 2d at 607\n(citing statistics showing that in 2002, the University offered over 5,631 classes,\n79% of which (4,448) had just one or zero African-American students; 30% of\nclasses (1,689) had zero or one Hispanic students).17 So, the controlling question\nis, “Is the University of Texas’s race-conscious policy effective?” And by effective,\nI do not mean that every statistically insignificant gain (i.e., adding one, three,\nor five students at the margin) qualifies. The constitutional inquiry for me\nconcerns whether the University’s program meaningfully furthers its intended\ngoal of increasing racial diversity on the road to critical mass. I find it does not.\n       In the 2008 admissions cycle, 29,501 students applied to the University of\nTexas.      See Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 590.          Less than half, 12,843, were\nadmitted and 6,715 ultimately enrolled.18 Id. Of these enrolled students, 6,322\ncame from Texas high schools.19 See Implementation and Results of the Texas\n\n\n\nR.L. Rand & Steven Andrew Light, Teaching Race Without a Critical Mass: Reflections on\nAffirmative Action and the Diversity Rationale, 54 J. LEGAL. EDUC. 316, 332–34 (2004) (noting\nthat under a cost-benefit analysis it may be more difficult to justify an affirmative action\nprogram when a university is unable to enroll a critical mass of minority applicants).\n       17\n          These statistics represent all classes at UT with five or more students, including\nlarge lecture courses. For classes with five to 24 students—the most likely to foster the\nvibrant discussion described in Grutter and Bakke—the figures are more revealing. In 2002,\nUT offered 3,616 classes with five to 24 students. Of these, 90% had one or zero African-\nAmerican students and 43% had one or zero Hispanic students. See Proposal to Consider Race\nand Ethnicity in Admissions, June 25, 2004 at 26, Table 8.\n       18\n         Today’s decision, like the district court’s, alternates between using statistics from\nadmitted and enrolled students. If realizing the educational benefits of diversity is the\nUniversity’s asserted interest, only the data for enrolled students is relevant to our review.\n       19\n         In the discussion that follows, I use the number of enrolled Texas residents (6,322)\nas a baseline rather than the aggregate enrollment for first-time freshman (6,715). There are\ntwo reasons for this. First, this case asks us to decide the necessity of UT’s race-conscious\n\n                                             77\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 78 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nAutomatic Admissions Law (HB 588) at the University of Texas at Austin,\nOctober 28, 2008 at 7 (“2008 Top Ten Percent Report”). 5,114 (80.9% of enrolled\nTexas residents) of these students were a product of Top Ten Percent, meaning\nthat, at most, 1,208 (19.1%) enrolled non-Top Ten Percent Texas residents had\nbeen evaluated on the basis of their AI/PAI scores. Id.\n       Of the 363 African-American freshmen from Texas high schools that were\nadmitted and enrolled (6% of the 6,322-member enrolling class from Texas high\nschools), 305 (4.8%) were a product of Top Ten Percent, while 58 (0.92%) African-\nAmerican enrollees had been evaluated on the basis of their AI/PAI scores.20 See\n2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 7. For the 1,322 (21%) total enrolled in-state\nHispanic students, 1,164 (18.4% of enrolled in-state students) were a product\nof Top Ten Percent, while 158 (2.5%) had been evaluated on the basis of their\nAI/PAI scores. Id. We know that in some cases an applicants’ AI score is high\nenough that the applicant is granted admission based on that score alone. But\nwe do not have data to show how many of these 58 African-American and 158\nHispanic students were admitted automatically based on their AI scores, which\nare race-neutral, and how many were admitted after factoring in the students’\n\n\n\nadmissions policy in light of Texas’s Top Ten Percent law. I find this question is evaluated\nmost effectively by comparing enrollment data for Texas residents, which include precise\nfigures for Top 10% and Non-Top 10% enrollees. Second, as the majority opinion recognizes,\nante at 44 n.155, the record does not include data showing what portion of the total applicant\npool were Texas residents and what portion came from out-of-state. This is problematic. We\nknow, for example, that the 2008 entering freshman class included 375 African-American and\n1,338 Hispanic students, and that 363 and 1,322 of these students, respectively, were Texas\nresidents. See 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6–7. So, although we know that the 2008\nenrolling freshman class included 12 African-American and 16 Hispanic students from out-of-\nstate, we cannot intelligently discuss the potential impact of UT’s race-conscious policy on this\ndata set without also having total application and admissions information available for non-\nTexas residents. This does not affect my conclusions—the number of non-Texas African-\nAmerican and Hispanic students enrolled in the freshman class is statistically insignificant.\n       20\n         In this section, I often refer to a raw number followed by a percentage listed in\nparentheses. E.g., “305 (4.8%).” This percentage figure (__%) is calculated by dividing number\nof students cited by 6,322, the number of enrolled Texas residents in the 2008 freshman class.\n\n                                               78\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 79 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\nPAI scores, which use the University’s Grutter-like holistic evaluation plan and\ninclude consideration of an applicant’s race as one of seven “special\ncircumstances.” Nonetheless, assuming that all 58 and 158 African-American\nand Hispanic students, respectively, were admitted on the basis of their\ncombined AI and PAI scores (i.e., that none of these minority students gained\nadmission on the basis of their race-neutral Academic Index score alone), the\nquestion is whether the University’s use of race, which is a “highly suspect tool,”\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 493, as part of the PAI score contributes a statistically\nsignificant enough number of minority students to affect critical mass at the\nUniversity of Texas.\n      We do not know, because the University does not maintain data, the\ndegree to which race influenced the University’s admissions decisions for any of\nthese enrolled students or how many of these students would not have been\nadmitted but-for the use of race as a plus factor. But assuming the University\ngave race decisive weight in each of these 58 African-American and 158 Hispanic\nstudents’ admissions decisions, those students would still only constitute 0.92%\nand 2.5%, respectively, of the entire 6,322-person enrolling in-state freshman\nclass. And this is assuming a 100%, unconstitutional use of race, not as a plus\nfactor, but as a categorical condition for guaranteed admission. See Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 329–30 (making race an automatic factor in admissions would “amount\nto outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.”).\n      Assume further, that such a prohibited use of race was employed in only\nhalf of the University’s admissions decisions. This would still only yield 29\n(0.46%) African-American and 79 (1.25%) Hispanic students.\n      Now assume that the University’s use of race is truly holistic; that given\nthe multitude of other race-neutral variables the University considers and\nvalues sincerely, race’s significance is limited in any individual application\npacket. See Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 608 (“UT considers race in its admissions\n\n                                        79\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 80 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\nprocess as a factor of a factor of a factor of a factor. As described in exhaustive\ndetail above, race is one of seven “special circumstances,” which is in turn one\nof six factors that make up an applicants personal achievement score.”). Lastly,\nassume that in this system, the University’s use of race results in a but-for offer\nof admission in one-quarter of the decisions. A twenty-five percent but-for\nadmissions rate seems highly improbable if race is truly limited in its holistic\nweighting, but the unlikelihood of the assumption proves my point. Even under\nsuch a system, the University’s proper use of race holistically would only yield\n15 (0.24%) African-American and 40 (0.62%) Hispanic students.             African-\nAmerican students, for example, admitted and enrolled by way of this holistic\nsystem would still only constitute two-tenths of one percent of the University of\nTexas’s 2008 entering freshman class.        Such a use of race could have no\ndiscernable impact on the classroom-level “educational benefits diversity is\ndesigned to produce” or otherwise influence “critical mass” at the University of\nTexas generally. Such a plan exacts a cost disproportionate to its benefit and is\nnot narrowly tailored. This is especially so on a university campus with, for\nexample, 4,448 classes (out of 5,631) with zero or one African-American students,\nand 1,689 classes with zero or one Hispanic students. Fisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d\nat 607.\n          More importantly, if the figures above are reasonably accurate, the\nUniversity’s use of race also fails Grutter’s compelling interest test as a factual\nmatter. See 539 U.S. at 333 (“[D]iminishing the force of [racial] stereotypes is\nboth a crucial part of the Law School’s mission, and one that it cannot\naccomplish with only token numbers of minority students.”). From its inception\nimmediately following Grutter, the University’s race-conscious admissions policy\nwas described as essential to the University of Texas’s educational mission:\n      [T]o accomplish [UT’s] mission and fulfill its flagship role . . . the\n      undergraduate experience for each student must include classroom\n\n\n                                        80\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 81 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\n      contact with peers of differing racial, ethnic, and cultural\n      backgrounds. The proposal to consider race in the admissions\n      process is not an exercise in racial balancing but an\n      acknowledgment that significant differences between the racial and\n      ethnic makeup of the University’s undergraduate population and\n      the state’s population prevent the University from fully achieving\n      its mission.\n\nFisher, 645 F. Supp. 2d at 602 (citing Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity\nin Admissions, June 25, 2004 at 24). If the University’s use of race is truly\nnecessary to accomplish its educational function, then as a factual matter, the\nUniversity of Texas’s race-conscious measures have been completely ineffectual\nin accomplishing its claimed compelling interest.\n      In contrast, Top Ten Percent was responsible for contributing 305 and\n1,164 African-American and Hispanic students, respectively, to the entering\n2008 freshman class using entirely race-neutral means.             These students\nrepresent 4.8% and 18.4% of the entering in-state freshman class. In addition,\nof the 58 African-American and 158 Hispanic enrolled students evaluated on the\nbasis of their AI and PAI scores, if the University’s use of race was truly holistic,\nthe percentage of these students for whom race was a decisive factor (i.e., but-for\nadmits) should be minimal. In other words, the vast majority of these 58 and\n158 students were admitted based on objective factors other than race. That is,\nthe University was able to obtain approximately 96% of the African-American\nand Hispanic students enrolled in the 2008 entering in-state freshman class\nusing race-neutral means. And although the University argues that this number\nstill does not qualify as critical mass, one thing is certain: the University of\nTexas’s use of race has had an infinitesimal impact on critical mass in the\nstudent body as a whole. As such, the University’s use of race can be neither\ncompelling nor narrowly tailored.\n\n\n\n\n                                         81\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 82 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       I do not envy the admissions officials at the University of Texas. In 1997,\nin response to our decision in Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932 (5th Cir. 1996), the\npeople of the State of Texas determined, through their elected representatives,\nthat something needed to be done to improve minority enrollment at Texas’s\npublic institutions of higher education.              Texas’s Top Ten Percent law was\nintended to effectuate that desire.                 We take no position today on the\nconstitutionality of that law.21 Instead, we are asked to scrutinize the legality of\nthe University’s race-conscious policy designed to complement Top Ten Percent.\nEven with the limited data available, I cannot find that the University of Texas’s\nuse of race is narrowly tailored where the University’s highly suspect use of race\nprovides no discernable educational impact.                In my view, the University’s\nprogram fails strict scrutiny before or after Grutter. See, e.g., Parents Involved\nin Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 790 (2007) (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring) (“[I]ndividual racial classifications employed in this manner may be\nconsidered legitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compelling\ninterest.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Before Grutter, it is unlikely that\nthe Supreme Court would have found that the University of Texas’s means were\nnarrowly tailored to the interest it asserts. Nonetheless, narrow tailoring in the\nuniversity admissions context is not about balancing constitutional costs and\nbenefits any longer. Post-Grutter, universities need not inflict the least harm\npossible so long as they operate in good faith. And in assessing good faith,\ninstitutions like the University of Texas need not even provide the type of\n\n       21\n          In assessing whether the University’s use of race is narrowly tailored, today’s\nmajority opinion finds that Top Ten Percent is not a race-neutral alternative that serves the\nUniversity’s asserted interest “about as well” as its Grutter-like plan. See ante at 39–46. My\nconcurrence should not be read to approve or reject the constitutionality of percentage plans\nlike Top Ten Percent. That issue remains open. I write separately to underscore the minimal\neffect that the University’s use of race has had on critical mass in light of Top Ten Percent, and\nwhy the University’s use of race would not, therefore, be narrowly tailored applying traditional\nstrict scrutiny principles before Grutter. I recognize that Grutter appears to swallow this\nconcern.\n\n                                               82\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 83 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\n\nmetrics that allow courts to review their affirmative action programs. As long\nas these public institutions remain sufficiently opaque in their use of race,\nreviewing courts like ours will be hard pressed to find anything short of good\nfaith and narrow tailoring. In the world post-Grutter, courts are enjoined to take\nuniversities at their word.\n                                          III\n      The Supreme Court’s narrow tailoring jurisprudence has been reliably\ntethered, at least before 2003, to the principle that whenever the government\ndivides citizens by race, which is itself an evil that can only be justified in the\nmost compelling circumstances, that the means chosen will inflict the least harm\npossible, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.), and fit the compelling\ngoal “so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the\nclassification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.” Croson, 488 U.S.\nat 493; see also Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 84 (2000) (“[W]hen a\nState discriminates on the basis of race . . . , we require a tighter fit between the\ndiscriminatory means and the legitimate ends they serve.”). Grutter abandoned\nthis principle and substituted in its place an amorphous, untestable, and above\nall, hopelessly deferential standard that ensures that race-based preferences in\nuniversity admissions will avoid meaningful judicial review for the next several\ndecades.\n      My disagreement with Grutter is more fundamental, however. Grutter’s\nfailing, in my view, is not only that it approved an affirmative action plan\nincapable of strict scrutiny, but more importantly, that it approved the use of\nrace in university admissions as a compelling state interest at all.\n      The idea of dividing people along racial lines is artificial and antiquated.\nHuman beings are not divisible biologically into any set number of races.22 A\n\n      22\n         See Alexander & Schwarzschild, 21 CONST. COMMENT. at 6 & n.10 (“There is broad\nscholarly support for this proposition. See, e.g., NAOMI ZACK, PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE AND\n\n                                          83\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 84 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nworld war was fought over such principles. Each individual is unique. And yet,\nin 2010, governmental decisionmakers are still fixated on dividing people into\nwhite, black, Hispanic, and other arbitrary subdivisions. The University of\nTexas, for instance, segregates student admissions data along five racial classes.\nSee, e.g., 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6 (reporting admissions data for White,\nNative-American, African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic students).\nThat is not how society looks any more, if it ever did.\n       When government divides citizens by race, matters are different.23\nGovernment-sponsored discrimination is repugnant to the notion of human\nequality and is more than the Constitution can bear. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“Preferment by race, when resorted to by the\nState, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential\nto destroy confidence in the Constitution and the idea of equality.”). There are\nno de minimis violations of the Equal Protection Clause, and when government\nundertakes any level of race-based social engineering, the costs are enormous.\nNot only are race-based policies inherently divisive, they reinforce stereotypes\nthat groups of people, because of their race, gender, or ethnicity, think alike or\nhave common life experiences. The Court has condemned such class-based\npresumptions repeatedly. See, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533\n(1996) (“Supposed ‘inherent differences’ are no longer accepted as a ground for\nrace or national origin classifications.”); Shaw, 509 U.S. at 647 (rejecting the\n\n\n\nRACE 58–62 (2002); JOSEPH L.

I do not see how racial discrimination in university admissions is any\nless repugnant to the Constitution.                If anything, government-sponsored\ndiscrimination in this context presents an even greater threat of long-term\nharm.24\n       For the most part, college admissions is a zero-sum game. Whenever one\nstudent wins, another loses. The entire competition, encouraged from age five\non, is premised on individual achievement and promise.25 It is no exaggeration\n\n      24\n         Professor Cohen succinctly describes some of the effects of racial and ethnic\npreferences in higher education:\n\n       1. preference divides the society in which it is awarded;\n       2. it establishes a precedent in excusing admitted racial discrimination to achieve\n           political objectives;\n       3. it corrupts the universities in which it is practiced, sacrificing intellectual values\n           and creating pressures to discriminate by race in grading and graduation;\n       4. . . .\n       5. it obscures the real social problem of why so many minority students are not\n           competitive academically;\n       6. it obliges a choice of some few ethnic groups, which are to be favored above all\n           others;\n       7. . . .\n       8. it removes incentives for academic excellence and encourages separatism among\n           racial and ethnic minorities;\n       9. it mismatches students and institutions, increasing the likelihood of failure for\n           many minority students; and\n       10. it injures race relations over the long haul.\n\nCARL COHEN & JAMES P. STERBA, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION & RACIAL PREFERENCE 109 (2003).\n      25\n          For example, in the School of Architecture, the School of Fine Arts, and certain\nhonors programs, where aptitude is essential, the University requires special portfolio,\naudition, and other requirements. See ante at 23 n.87. In these and other impacted programs\n\n                                              85\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 86 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\nto say that the college application is 18 years in the making and is an unusually\npersonal experience: the application presents a student’s best self in the hopes\nthat her sustained hard work and experience to date will be rewarded with\nadmission. Race-based preferences break faith with this expectation by favoring\na handful of students based on a trait beyond the control of all. See Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 361 (opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall & Blackmun, JJ.)\n(“[A]dvancement sanctioned, sponsored, or approved by the State should ideally\nbe based on individual merit or achievement, or at least on factors within the\ncontrol of the individual . . . .”). Given the highly personal nature of the college\nadmissions process, this kind of class-based discrimination poses an especially\nacute threat of resentment and its corollary—entitlement. More fundamentally,\nit “assures that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the\nultimate goal of eliminating entirely from governmental decisionmaking such\nirrelevant factors as a human being’s race will never be achieved.” Croson, 488\nU.S. at 495 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n       Yesterday’s racial discrimination was based on racial preference; today’s\nracial preference results in racial discrimination. Changing the color of the\ngroup discriminated against simply inverts, but does address, the fundamental\nproblem: the Constitution prohibits all forms of government-sponsored racial\ndiscrimination. Grutter puts the Supreme Court’s imprimatur on such ruinous\nbehavior and ensures that race will continue to be a divisive facet of American\nlife for at least the next two generations. Like the plaintiffs and countless other\ncollege applicants denied admission based, in part, on government-sponsored\nracial discrimination, I await the Court’s return to constitutional first principles.\n\n\n\n\nwhere student demand outstrips available space, the University recognizes and uses merit as\nthe decisive consideration in admission. I do not see why excellence and merit warrant less\nconsideration in the University’s other disciplines.\n\n                                            86\n\f",

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n       We consider a challenge to the use of race in undergraduate admissions at\nthe University of Texas at Austin. While the University has confined its explicit\nuse of race to the elements of a program approved by the Supreme Court in\nGrutter v. Bollinger,1 UT’s program acts upon a university applicant pool shaped\nby a legislatively-mandated parallel diversity initiative that guarantees\nadmission to Texas students in the top ten percent of their high school class.\nThe ever-increasing number of minorities gaining admission under this Top Ten\nPercent Law casts a shadow on the horizon to the otherwise-plain legality of the\nGrutter-like admissions program, the Law’s own legal footing aside. While the\nLaw’s ultimate fate is not the fare of this suit, the challenge to the Grutter plan\nhere rests upon the intimate ties and ultimate confluence of the two initiatives.\nToday we affirm the constitutionality of the University’s program as it existed\nwhen Appellants applied and were denied admission.\n       Abigail Fisher and Rachel Michalewicz, both Texas residents, were denied\nundergraduate admission to the University of Texas at Austin for the class\nentering in Fall 2008. They filed this suit alleging that UT’s admissions policies\ndiscriminated against them on the basis of race in violation of their right to\nequal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and federal civil rights\nstatutes.2 They sought damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.\nProceeding with separate phases of liability and remedy, the district court, in a\nthoughtful opinion, found no liability and granted summary judgment to the\nUniversity.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).\n      2\n       Fisher v.

There\nare no class claims and both students deny intention to reapply to UT.3 It\nfollows that Fisher and Michalewicz lack standing to seek injunctive or forward-\nlooking declaratory relief.4 This principle is rote. To obtain forward-looking\nequitable remedies, a plaintiff must show she faces imminent threat of future\ninjury.5     Without that threat, these two applicants only have standing to\nchallenge their rejection and to seek money damages for their injury.6\n       Our focus will be upon the process employed by UT to admit freshmen\nwhen Fisher and Michalewicz applied for the class entering Fall 2008, looking\nto earlier and later years only as they illuminate the rejection of these two\napplicants.7      Our task is burdened by the reality that we are examining a\ndynamic program administered by a large university subject to government\noversight. Indeed, the first of UT’s periodic five-year reviews was to begin in the\nfall of 2009, a review that must engage an array of variables, including an ever-\npresent question of whether to adjust the percentage of students admitted under\nthe two diversity initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Like all Texas residents, Appellants could attend UT Austin as transfer students if\nthey first enrolled in a participating UT system school and met the standards required by the\nCoordinated Admissions Program, discussed in greater detail below.

GRUTTER V. BOLLINGER\n       We begin with Grutter v. Bollinger because UT’s race-conscious admissions\nprocedures were modeled after the program it approved.                        In rejecting\nconstitutional challenges to the University of Michigan Law School’s admissions\nprogram, Grutter held that the Equal Protection Clause did not prohibit a\nuniversity’s “narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a\ncompelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse\nstudent body.”8 Mapping on Grutter, UT evaluates each application using a\nholistic, multi-factor approach, in which race is but one of many considerations.\nIn granting summary judgment to UT, the district court found that “it would be\ndifficult for UT to construct an admissions policy that more closely resembles the\npolicy approved by the Supreme Court in Grutter,” and “as long as Grutter\nremains good law, UT’s current admissions program remains constitutional.” 9\nLaying aside the Top Ten Percent Law, that observation is indisputably sound.10\n\n\n                                                 A\n       Grutter embraced the diversity interest articulated twenty-five years\nearlier by Justice Powell, who wrote separately in Regents of the University of\nCalifornia v.

The Grutter Court endorsed this goal, holding that\ndiversity, including seeking a critical mass of minority students, is “a compelling\nstate interest that can justify the use of race in university admissions.” 16\n      That the concept of critical mass bears a simple but deceptive label is\nevidenced by the division of the Justices over its meaning.

Synthesizing, we find at least three\ndistinct educational objectives served by the diversity she envisioned:\n      1.        Increased Perspectives. Justice O’Connor observed that\n                including diverse perspectives improves the quality of the\n                educational process because “classroom discussion is livelier,\n                more spirited, and simply more enlightening and interesting\n                when the students have the greatest possible variety of\n                backgrounds.”19 In this respect, Grutter echoes Justice\n                Powell’s recognition in Bakke that it is “essential to the\n                quality of higher education” that a university be able to\n                pursue “[t]he atmosphere of speculation, excitement and\n                creation” that is “promoted by a diverse student body.” 20\n                Indeed, diversity often brings not just excitement, but\n                valuable knowledge as well. “[A] student with a particular\n                background—whether it be ethnic, geographic, culturally\n                advantaged or disadvantaged—may bring to a [university]\n                experiences, outlooks, and ideas that enrich the training of its\n\n\n\n\n      17\n           Id. at 380 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).\n      18\n           Id. at 329–30 (opinion of the Court).\n      19\n           Id. at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      20\n           438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.)

Professionalism.       The majority pointed to “numerous\n            studies” showing that “student body diversity . . . better\n            prepares [students] as professionals.”22 The Court has\n            “repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of\n            preparing students for work and citizenship,”23 and today’s\n            students must be prepared to work within “an increasingly\n            diverse workforce.”24 Indeed, “major American businesses\n            have made clear that the skills needed in today’s increasingly\n            global marketplace can only be developed through exposure\n            to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints.”25 A\n            diverse student body serves this end by “promot[ing]\n            cross-racial understanding, help[ing] to break down racial\n            stereotypes, and enabl[ing] students to better understand\n            persons of different races.” 26\n\n 3.         Civic Engagement. The Court recognized that “[e]ffective\n            participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in\n            the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one\n            Nation, indivisible, is to be realized.”27 A diverse student body\n            is crucial for fostering this ideal of civic engagement, because\n            “[i]n order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the\n            eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to\n            leadership be visibly open to talented and qualified\n            individuals of every race and ethnicity.”28 Maintaining a\n            visibly open path to leadership demands that “[a]ccess to\n            [higher] education . . . be inclusive of talented and qualified\n\n\n 21\n      Id. at 314.\n 22\n      Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n 23\n      Id.

Grutter also\ncautioned that, while it accepted diversity as a compelling interest, any sorting\nof persons on the basis of race must be by measures narrowly tailored to the\ninterest at stake.\n       As we read the Court, a university admissions program is narrowly\ntailored only if it allows for individualized consideration of applicants of all\n\n\n\n\n       29\n            Id. at 332–33. The Court further explained:\n       [E]ducation [is] pivotal to sustaining our political and cultural heritage with a\n       fundamental role in maintaining the fabric of society. . . . [T]he diffusion of\n       knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher education must\n       be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity. The United\n       States, as amicus curiae, affirms that “[e]nsuring that public institutions are\n       open and available to all segments of American society, including people of all\n       races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government objective.” And,\n       “[n]owhere is the importance of such openness more acute than in the context\n       of higher education.”\n\nId. at 331–32 (final two alterations in original; citations and some internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n       30\n            Id. at 332.\n\n                                               8\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 9 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nraces.31 Such consideration does not define an applicant by race but instead\nensures that she is valued for all her unique attributes. Rather than applying\nfixed stereotypes of ways that race affects students’ lives, an admissions policy\nmust be “‘flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements of diversity in light\nof the particular qualifications of each applicant.’”32 As the Supreme Court later\nsummarized, “The entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the admissions\nprogram at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not\nsimply as a member of a particular racial group.”33                         Thus, a university\nadmissions policy is more likely to be narrowly tailored if it contemplates that\na broad range of qualities and experiences beyond race will be important\ncontributions to diversity and as such are appropriately considered in\nadmissions decisions.34\n       Because a race-conscious admissions program is constitutional only if\nholistic, flexible, and individualized, a university may not establish a quota for\nminority applicants, nor may it evaluate minority applications “on separate\nadmissions tracks.”35 The “racial-set-aside program” rejected by Justice Powell\nin Bakke ran afoul of these related prohibitions because it reserved 16 out of 100\nseats for members of certain minority groups.36 A university also may not award\na fixed number of bonus points to minority applicants.37 That was the lesson of\n\n\n\n       31\n            Id. at 337.\n       32\n            Id.

So\ndeployed, a white applicant raised by a single parent who did not attend high\nschool and struggled paycheck to paycheck and a minority child of a successful\ncardiovascular surgeon may both claim adversity, but the personal hurdles each\nhas cleared will not be seen to be of the same height.\n\n\n                                                C\n      Finally, Grutter requires that any race-conscious measures must have a\n“logical end point” and be “limited in time.”39 This durational requirement can\nbe satisfied by sunset provisions or by periodic reviews to reconsider whether\nthere are feasible race-neutral alternatives that would achieve diversity\ninterests “‘about as well.’”40 In this respect, Grutter is best seen not as an\nunqualified endorsement of racial preferences, but as a transient response to\nanemic academic diversity. As Justice O’Connor observed, “We expect that 25\nyears from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to\nfurther the interest approved today.” 41\n\n\n\n\n      38\n           Id.\n      39\n           Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342.\n      40\n           Id. at 339 (quoting Wygant v.

HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY’S ADMISSIONS POLICIES\n       Justice O’Connor’s vision may prove to be more aspirational than\npredictive. Regardless, universities will construct admissions programs wedded\nto their missions, which include bringing both meritorious and diverse students\nto campus. Each year, UT receives applications from approximately four times\nmore students than it can enroll.42              Over the past two decades, UT has\nrepeatedly revised its admissions procedures to reflect its calculus of educational\nvalues while navigating judicial decisions and legislative mandates.\n\n\n                                               A\n       Until 1996, UT selected students using two metrics. The first measure,\nstill employed today, is the Academic Index (“AI”), a computation based on the\nstudent’s high school class rank, standardized test scores, and the extent to\nwhich the applicant exceeded UT’s required high school curriculum.43 Perceiving\nthat AI alone would produce a class with unacceptably low diversity levels, UT\nconsidered a second element for admissions—race. These measures combined\nresulted in UT admitting more than 90% of applicants who were ranked in the\ntop ten percent of their high school class.44\n       There were then no clear legal limits on a university’s use of race in\nadmissions. The Supreme Court decided Bakke in 1978 but its guidance came\n\n\n\n\n       42\n            Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Thus, even though a top ranking at a predominantly minority high\nschool would contribute to a higher AI score, the AI alone could not effectively serve as a proxy\nfor race because, on average, minorities received lower standardized test scores.\n\n                                               11\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 12 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nin a fractured decision, leaving a quarter century of uncertainty.45 The record\ndoes not detail precisely how race factored in admissions decisions during this\ntime, but it is undisputed that race was considered directly and was often a\ncontrolling factor in admission.46 Under this race-conscious admissions policy,\nthe freshman class entering in Fall 1993 included 5,329 students, of whom 238\nwere African-American (4.5% of the overall class) and 832 were Hispanic\n(15.6%).47\n\n\n                                                B\n       Race-conscious admissions ended in 1996 with Hopwood v.

Four other Justices would have held that Title VI of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 bars federally funded universities from making any admissions\ndecisions on the basis of race. Id. at 417–18 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C.J., and\nStewart and Rehnquist, JJ.). Justice Powell cast the decisive vote in a separate opinion—not\njoined in full by any other Justice—that invalidated the racial set-aside in the admissions\nprogram then before the Court, but reasoned that it would be constitutional for a university\nto consider race as one facet of diversity in a flexible review that treated each applicant as an\nindividual.

The first study examined minority representation in undergraduate\nclasses, focusing on classes of “participatory size,” which it defined as between\n5 and 24 students. UT analyzed these classes, which included most of the\nundergraduate courses, because they offered the best opportunity for robust\nclassroom discussion, rich soil for diverse interactions. According to the study,\n90% of these smaller classes in Fall 2002 had either one or zero\nAfrican-American students, 46% had one or zero Asian-American students, and\n43% had one or zero Hispanic students.62 A later retabulation, which excluded\nthe very smallest of these classes and considered only classes with 10 to 24\nstudents, found          that   89%     of those     classes had       either one      or zero\nAfrican-American students, 41% had one or zero Asian-American students, and\n37% had either one or zero Hispanic students.63                     In its second study, UT\nsurveyed undergraduates on their impressions of diversity on campus and in the\nclassroom. Minority students reported feeling isolated, and a majority of all\nstudents felt there was “insufficient minority representation” in classrooms for\n“the full benefits of diversity to occur.” 64\n       The University incorporated the findings of these two studies in its June\n2004 Proposal to Consider Race and Ethnicity in Admissions.65                        The 2004\nProposal concluded that diverse student enrollment “break[s] down stereotypes,”\n“promotes cross-racial understanding,” and “prepares students for an\n\n\n       62\n         Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

One magazine\ndedicated to diversity in higher education ranked UT “sixth in the nation in\nproducing undergraduate degrees for minority groups.” 71 In an entering class\nthat was roughly the same size in 1998 as it was in 2008, the enrollment of\nAfrican-American students doubled from 165 students to 335 students. Hispanic\nenrollment increased approximately 1.5 times, from 762 students to 1,228\nstudents. Asian-American enrollment also increased nearly 10%, from 1,034\nstudents to 1,126 students.72 By contrast, in 2004, the last year the Top Ten\nPercent Law operated without the Grutter plan, fall enrollment included only\n275 African-Americans and 1,024 Hispanics.\n       Because of the myriad programs instituted, it can be difficult to attribute\nincreases in minority enrollment to any one initiative.                      In addition,\ndemographics have shifted in Texas, so increases in minority enrollment likely\nin part reflect the increased presence of minorities statewide.\n\n\n                          III.

This particular ranking is somewhat limited in its significance, however, as the\nresults are based on raw tabulations of the number of degrees conferred upon minority\nstudents.

Accordingly, it begins\nits admissions process by dividing applicants into three pools: (1) Texas\nresidents, (2) domestic non-Texas residents, and (3) international students.\nStudents compete for admission only against other students in their respective\npool. Texas residents are allotted 90% of all available seats, with admission\nbased on a two-tiered system, beginning with students automatically admitted\nunder the Top Ten Percent Law and then filling the remaining seats on the basis\nof the Academic and Personal Achievement Indices.73 Because Appellants are\nTexas residents, their challenge focuses on the admissions procedures applied\nto in-state applicants.\n       Texas applicants are divided into two subgroups: (1) Texas residents who\nare in the top ten percent of their high school class and (2) those Texas residents\nwho are not.      Top ten percent applicants are guaranteed admission to the\nUniversity, and the vast majority of freshmen are selected in this way, without\na confessed consideration of race. In 2008, for example, 81% of the entering class\nwas admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law, filling 88% of the seats allotted\nto Texas residents and leaving only 1,216 offers of admission university-wide for\nnon-top ten percent residents.74 The impact of the Top Ten Percent Law on UT’s\nadmissions has increased dramatically since it was first introduced in 1998,\n\n\n\n\n       73\n        Admission decisions for domestic non-Texas residents and international applicants\nare made solely on the basis of their Academic and Personal Achievement Indices.\n       74\n         2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 8 tbl.2, 9 tbl.2b.

Others are low enough that\ntheir applications are considered presumptively denied. If an application is\npresumptively denied, senior admission staff review the file and may, on rare\noccasions, designate the file for full review notwithstanding the AI score.78\n       The Personal Achievement Index is based on three scores: one score for\neach of the two required essays and a third score, called the personal\nachievement score, which represents an evaluation of the applicant’s entire file.\nThe essays are each given a score between 1 and 6 through “a holistic evaluation\nof the essay as a piece of writing based on its complexity of thought,\n\n\n\n\n       75\n         Id. at 7 tbl.1a.

The precise formulas used to calculate an applicant’s\nAcademic Index are derived by regression analysis and vary by intended major.

Admissions staff assign the score by assessing an applicant’s\ndemonstrated leadership qualities, awards and honors, work experience, and\ninvolvement in extracurricular activities and community service. In addition,\nthe personal achievement score includes a “special circumstances” element that\nmay reflect the socioeconomic status of the applicant and his or her high school,\nthe applicant’s family status and family responsibilities, the applicant’s\nstandardized test score compared to the average of her high school,\nand—beginning in 2004—the applicant’s race.81                   To assess these intangible\nfactors, evaluators read the applicant’s essays again, but this time with an eye\nto the information conveyed rather than the quality of the student’s writing.\nAdmissions officers undergo annual training by a nationally recognized expert\nin holistic scoring, and senior staff members perform quality control to verify\nthat awarded scores are appropriate and consistent.

To avoid oversubscription and\nto allow these colleges and majors to admit some non-top ten percent applicants,\nUT caps the percentage of students automatically admitted to these programs\nat 75% of the available spaces.88\n       Top Ten Percent Law applicants who do not receive automatic entry to\ntheir first choice program compete for admission to the remaining spaces, and\nif necessary to their second-choice program, on the basis of their AI and PAI\nscores. The admissions office places students into matrices for each preferred\nschool or major, with students grouped by AI score along one axis and PAI score\nalong the other axis. Liaisons for the majors then establish a cutoff line, which\nis drawn in a stair-step pattern. Applicants denied admission to their first-\nchoice program are considered for their second choice, with cutoff lines\nreadjusted to reflect the influx of those applicants.

Instead, those residents not admitted to the entering fall class are\noffered admission to either the summer program or the Coordinated Admissions\nProgram (CAP). Marginal applicants who missed the cutoff for the fall class are\noffered admission to the summer program, which permits students to begin their\nstudies at UT during the summer and then join the regularly admitted students\nin the fall. About 800 students enroll in the summer program each year. All\nremaining Texas applicants are automatically enrolled in CAP, which\nguarantees admission as a transfer student if the student enrolls in another UT\nsystem campus for her freshman year and meets certain other conditions,\nincluding the completion of thirty credit hours with a cumulative grade point\naverage of 3.2 or higher.\n\n\n                                          C\n         The Academic Index and Personal Achievement Index now employed by\nUT have been in continuous use since 1997.

First, these decisions are a product of “complex\neducational judgments in an area that lies primarily within the expertise of the\nuniversity,” far outside the experience of the courts.97 Second, “universities\noccupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition,” with educational\nautonomy grounded in the First Amendment.98 As Justice Powell explained in\nBakke, “[a]cademic freedom . . . . includes [a university’s] selection of its student\nbody.”99\n      Yet the scrutiny triggered by racial classification “is no less strict for\ntaking into account” the special circumstances of higher education.100 “[S]trict\nscrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the\nimportance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental\ndecisionmaker for the use of race in [a] particular context.”101 Narrow tailoring,\na component of strict scrutiny, requires any use of racial classifications to so\nclosely fit a compelling goal as to remove the possibility that the motive for the\nclassification was illegitimate racial stereotype. Rather than second-guess the\nmerits of the University’s decision, a task we are ill-equipped to perform, we\ninstead scrutinize the University’s decisionmaking process to ensure that its\ndecision to adopt a race-conscious admissions policy followed from the good faith\nconsideration Grutter requires.

Instead, they maintain Grutter deferred only to the\nuniversity’s judgment that diversity would have educational benefits, not to the\nassessment of whether the university has attained critical mass of a racial group\nor whether race-conscious efforts are necessary to achieve that end.\n       As an initial matter, this argument in its full flower is contradicted by\nGrutter.       The majority held that, like the examination into whether the\nUniversity has a compelling interest, “the narrow-tailoring inquiry . . . must be\ncalibrated to fit the distinct issues raised by the use of race to achieve student\nbody diversity in public higher education.”103          That is, the narrow-tailoring\ninquiry—like the compelling-interest inquiry—is undertaken with a degree of\ndeference to the University’s constitutionally protected, presumably expert\nacademic judgment.\n       Appellants would have us borrow a more restrictive standard of review\nfrom a series of public employment and government contracting cases, in which\nthe Supreme Court “held that certain government actions to remedy past racial\ndiscrimination—actions that are themselves based on race—are constitutional\nonly where there is a ‘strong basis in evidence’ that the remedial actions were\n\n\n       102\n          Id. at 329 (“[G]ood faith on the part of a university is presumed absent a showing\nto the contrary.” (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 318–19\n(opinion of Powell, J.))).\n       103\n             Id. at 333–34.\n\n                                            28\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 29 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\nnecessary.”104 The Court most recently applied this strong-basis-in-evidence\nstandard in Ricci v.

Yet\nthe Court found that an intent-based standard could not be squared with the\nstatutory text. The Ricci Court turned to the strong-basis-in-evidence standard\n“as a matter of statutory construction to resolve any conflict between the\ndisparate-treatment and disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.” 111\n       Although Ricci did not address the firefighters’ equal protection claim, the\nCourt derived its standard from Richmond v.

In doing so, it touches the third rail of racial quotas.\nWygant and Croson both involved explicit quotas; in Ricci, the Court was\nconcerned that the city’s use of race threatened to devolve into a de facto quota.\n      By contrast, Grutter recognized that universities are engaged in a\ndifferent enterprise. Their holistic approach is part of a forward-looking effort\nto obtain the educational benefits of diversity. The look to race as but one\nelement of this further goal, coupled with individualized consideration, steers\nuniversity admissions away from a quota system. Grutter teaches that so long\nas a university considers race in a holistic and individualized manner, and not\nas part of a quota or fixed-point system, courts must afford a measure of\ndeference to the university’s good faith determination that certain race-conscious\nmeasures are necessary to achieve the educational benefits of diversity,\nincluding attaining critical mass in minority enrollment.\n      Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\nfurther supports this understanding.116 When scrutinizing two school districts’\nrace-conscious busing plans, the Court invoked Grutter’s “serious, good faith\nconsideration” standard, rather than the strong-basis-in-evidence standard that\nAppellants would have us apply.117 The Parents Involved Court never suggested\nthat the school districts would be required to prove their plans were meticulously\nsupported by some particular quantum of specific evidence. Rather, the Court\nstruck down the school districts’ programs because they pursued racial balancing\nand defined students based on racial group classifications, not on individual\ncircumstances.\n      In short, the Court has not retreated from Grutter’s mode of analysis, one\ntailored to holistic university admissions programs.

Rather, Appellants question whether UT needs a Grutter-like\npolicy. As their argument goes, the University’s race-conscious admissions\nprogram is unwarranted because (1) UT has gone beyond a mere interest in\ndiversity for education’s sake and instead pursues a racial composition that\nmirrors that of the state of Texas as a whole, amounting to an unconstitutional\nattempt to achieve “racial balancing”; (2) the University has not given adequate\nconsideration to available “race-neutral” alternatives, particularly percentage\nplans like the Top Ten Percent Law; and (3) UT’s minority enrollment under the\nTop Ten Percent Law already surpassed critical mass, such that the additional\n(and allegedly “minimal”) increase in diversity achieved through UT’s Grutter-\nlike policy does not justify its use of race-conscious measures. We will consider\neach of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n                                V. RACIAL BALANCING\n      Again, diversity is a permissible goal for educational institutions, but\n“outright racial balancing” is not. Attempting to ensure that the student body\ncontains some specified percentage of a particular racial group is “patently\nunconstitutional.”118 This concept follows from the Supreme Court’s repeated\nemphasis that, by itself, increasing racial representation is not a sufficiently\ncompelling interest to justify the use of racial preferences. Grutter described\n\n\n      118\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 329–30 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n\n                                                32\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 33 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nmany important educational interests that may be sought through diversity, but\nsteadfastly maintained that “‘[r]acial balance is not to be to be achieved for its\nown sake.’”119 Moreover, “[t]he point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which\nthe Grutter Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications\nwas indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort\nto achieve racial balance” by creating an unconstitutional quota.120\n\n\n                                                  A\n       Looking to the details of UT’s race-conscious admissions policy, it is clear\nthat administrators knew a quota system would not survive judicial review, and\nthey took care to avoid this fatal mistake. UT’s system was modeled after the\nGrutter program, which the Supreme Court held was not a quota. UT has never\nestablished a specific number, percentage, or range of minority enrollment that\nwould constitute “critical mass,” nor does it award any fixed number of points to\nminority students in a way that impermissibly values race for its own sake.121\n       Further, there is no indication that UT’s Grutter-like plan is a quota by\nanother name.

Its methods and efforts belie the\ncharge.      The percentage of Hispanics at UT is less than two-thirds the\npercentage of Hispanics in Texas, and the percentage of African-Americans at\nUT is half the percentage of Texas’s African-American population, while\nAsian-American enrollment is more than five times the percentage of Texan\nAsian-Americans.125\n\n\n                                                B\n      Appellants nevertheless argue that UT’s program amounts to racial\nbalancing because it supposedly evinces a special concern for demographically\nunderrepresented groups, while neglecting the diverse contributions of others.\nThese arguments do not account for the operation of UT’s admissions system or\nthe scope of the diversity interest approved by the Court in Grutter.\n\n\n\n\n      122\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336 (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).\n      123\n            Id. at 335 (quoting Sheet Metal Workers v.

This possibility is the point of Grutter’s holistic and individualized\nassessments, which must be “‘flexible enough to consider all pertinent elements\nof diversity in light of the particular qualifications of each applicant.’”127 Indeed,\njust as in Grutter, UT applicants of every race may submit supplemental\ninformation to highlight their potential diversity contributions, which allows\nstudents who are diverse in unconventional ways to describe their unique\nattributes.128\n      The summary judgment record shows that demographics are not consulted\nas part of any individual admissions decision, and UT’s admissions procedures\ndo not treat certain racial groups or minorities differently than others when\nreviewing individual applications. Rather, the act of considering minority group\ndemographics (to which Appellants object) took place only when the University\nfirst studied whether a race-conscious admissions program was needed to attain\ncritical mass. Appellants’ objection therefore must be directed not to the design\nof the program, but rather to whether UT’s decision to reintroduce race as a\nfactor in admissions was made in good faith.\n\n\n\n\n      126\n            Id. at 606.\n      127\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 337 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 317 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n      128\n            Id. at 338; see Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

They insist that if UT were truly focused\non educational benefits and critical mass, then there should be no reason to\nconsult demographic data when determining whether UT had sufficient minority\nrepresentation.\n      We disagree. The University’s policies and measured attention to the\ncommunity it serves are consonant with the educational goals outlined in\nGrutter and do not support a finding that the University was engaged in\nimproper racial balancing during our time frame of review. Both Grutter and\nBakke recognized that “there is of course ‘some relationship between numbers\nand achieving the benefits to be derived from a diverse student body.’”129 In its\npolicymaking process, UT gave appropriate attention to those educational\nbenefits identified in Grutter without overstepping any constitutional bounds.\n      Grutter recognized that racial and ethnic backgrounds play an influential\nrole in producing the diversity of views and perspectives which are paramount\nto a university’s educational mission.              As Justice O’Connor explained, the\n“unique experience of being a racial minority in a society, like our own, in which\nrace unfortunately still matters” can have a significant impact on a student’s\nviews.130 The Court acknowledged that “[b]y virtue of our Nation’s struggle with\nracial inequality, [underrepresented minority students] are both likely to have\nexperiences with particular importance to the [University’s] mission, and less\nlikely to be admitted in meaningful numbers on criteria that ignore these\nexperiences.”131 UT properly concluded that these individuals from the state’s\n\n\n      129\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 336 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 323 (opinion of Powell, J.)).\n      130\n            Id. at 333.\n      131\n            Id. at 338.\n\n                                               36\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 37 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nunderrepresented minorities would be most likely to add unique perspectives\nthat are otherwise absent from its classrooms. Identifying which backgrounds\nare underrepresented, in turn, presupposes some reference to demographics, and\nit was therefore appropriate for UT to give limited attention to this data when\nconsidering whether its current student body included a critical mass of\nunderrepresented groups.\n      Preparing students to function as professionals in an increasingly diverse\nworkforce likewise calls for some consideration of a university’s particular\neducational mission and the community it serves. For instance, a nationally\nrenowned law school draws upon a nationwide applicant pool and sends its\ngraduates into careers in all states; therefore it is appropriate for such a school\nto consider national diversity levels when setting goals for its admissions\nprogram. In contrast, UT’s stated goal is to “produce graduates who are capable\nof fulfilling the future leadership needs of Texas.”132 This objective calls for a\nmore tailored diversity emphasis.            In a state as racially diverse as Texas,\nensuring that graduates learn to collaborate with members of racial groups they\nwill encounter in the workforce is especially important. The 2004 Proposal\nconcluded that a race-conscious admissions program was necessary at UT\nspecifically because “from a racial, ethnic, and cultural standpoint, students at\nthe University [were] being educated in a less-than-realistic environment that\n[was] not conducive to training the leaders of tomorrow.” 133\n      The need for a state’s leading educational institution to foster civic\nengagement and maintain visibly open paths to leadership also requires a degree\nof attention to the surrounding community. A university presenting itself as\nopen to all may be challenged when the state’s minority population grows\nsteadily but minority enrollment does not. Indeed, the 2004 Proposal expressed\n\n\n      132\n            2004 Proposal at 23 (quoted in Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

But through the Top Ten Percent Law and Grutter-like\nplan, UT has increased its minority applicant pool in its effort to ensure that it\nserves as a flagship university for the entire state, not just Texans of certain\nbackgrounds. Cultivating paths to leadership for underrepresented groups\nserves both the individual and the public, sustaining an infrastructure of leaders\nin an increasingly pluralistic society.             Although a university must eschew\ndemographic targets, it need not be blind to significant racial disparities in its\ncommunity, nor is it wholly prohibited from taking the degree of disparity into\naccount.\n       Finally, Grutter’s structure accepts that a university’s twin objectives of\nrewarding academic merit and fostering diversity can be complementary rather\nthan competing goals; that students rising to the top of underrepresented groups\ndemonstrate promise as future leaders. These students’ relative success in the\nface of harmful and widespread stereotypes evidences a degree of drive,\ndetermination, and merit not captured by test scores alone.                         Insofar as\nAppellants complain that the University’s limited attention to demographics was\ninconsistent with the legitimate educational concerns recognized in Bakke and\nGrutter, we conclude that their contention cannot be sustained.\n\n\n\n       134\n             Id. at 14.\n       135\n          See, e.g., Mark C.

While Appellants’ view may comport with\none literal interpretation of the “critical mass” label, it is not the view that\nprevailed in Grutter. The Grutter majority defined critical mass “by reference\nto the educational benefits that diversity is designed to produce,”136 and the\neducational benefits recognized in Grutter go beyond the narrow “pedagogical\nconcept” urged by Appellants. On this understanding, there is no reason to\nassume that critical mass will or should be the same for every racial group or\nevery university.        We are persuaded, as was the district court, that the\nUniversity adhered to Grutter when it reintroduced race into its admissions\nprocess based in part on an analysis that devoted special attention to those\nminorities which were most significantly underrepresented on its campus.\n\n\n                         VI. THE TOP TEN PERCENT LAW\n      Grutter is best read as a path toward the moment when all race-conscious\nmeasures become unnecessary. To that end, Grutter requires universities that\nemploy race-conscious admissions to seriously consider race-neutral alternatives.\nBut “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion of every conceivable\nrace-neutral alternative,” especially if the proffered alternatives would require\nthe University to sacrifice other important interests, like its academic selectivity\nand reputation for excellence.137\n\n\n      136\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 339.\n      137\n            See id. at 339–340.\n\n                                            39\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 40 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       The parties devote significant attention to the Top Ten Percent Law.138\nSince the Law was first enacted in 1997, UT has seen increases in both\nAfrican-American and Hispanic enrollment, but again, changing demographics\nand other minority outreach programs render it difficult to quantify the\nincreases attributable to the Top Ten Percent Law.139\n       Appellants put forward the Top Ten Percent Law as a facially race-neutral\nalternative that would allow UT to obtain a critical mass of minority enrollment\nwithout resorting to race-conscious admissions. As the argument goes, if the Top\nTen Percent Law were able to serve the University’s interests “about as well” as\nrace-conscious admissions, without differentiating between students on the basis\nof   race,     then    it   would    render     UT’s    current     admissions      program\nunconstitutional.140        UT responds that the Top Ten Percent Law does not\nconstitute a workable alternative to a flexible admissions system, and so it is\n“entirely irrelevant” as a matter of law in determining whether or not a\nuniversity may adopt the holistic consideration of race to achieve critical mass.\n       UT is correct that so-called “percentage plans” are not a constitutionally\nmandated replacement for race-conscious admissions programs under Grutter,\nalthough—as will become apparent—this realization alone does not end our\nconstitutional inquiry. The idea of percentage plans as a viable alternative to\nrace-conscious admissions policies was directly advocated to the Grutter Court\n\n\n\n\n      138\n           TEX . ED U C . CODE § 51.803 (1997). The precise impact UT’s other race-neutral\nalternatives (such as scholarship and outreach programs) have had on minority enrollment\nis not clear, but their effect would not appear to be great enough to bear on the\nconstitutionality of the University’s race-conscious admissions policy.\n      139\n         Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

By now it is clear that the Law is\ninescapably tied to UT’s Grutter plan, as Grutter does its work with the\napplicants who remain after the cut of the Top Ten Percent Law. In 2008, top\nten percent applicants accounted for 8,984 of the 10,200 Texas admittees.144\nThus, with the Top Ten Percent Law in effect, UT’s Grutter plan can only\npossibly influence the review of approximately 1,200 admitted students’\napplications.145 In evaluating the constitutionality of an admissions program,\n\n\n\n\n       141\n        The United States has since filed an amicus brief in the present case, urging us to\nuphold UT’s current admissions program.\n       142\n             Grutter, 539 U.S. at 340 (internal citation omitted).\n       143\n             Id.\n       144\n             2008 Top Ten Report at 8 tbl.2; Ishop Aff.

In the College of\nEducation, 22.4% of students are Hispanic and 10.1% are African-American. By\ncontrast, in the College of Business Administration, only 14.5% of the students\nare Hispanic and 3.4% are African-American.148 It is evident that if UT is to\nhave diverse interactions, it needs more minority students who are interested\nin and meet the requirements for a greater variety of colleges, not more students\ndisproportionately enrolled in certain programs.

We also\nnote that since it began, the Top Ten Percent Law has had an increasing impact on admissions\ndecisions. In 1998, top ten percent candidates comprised just 41% of Texans in the freshman\nclass. In 2004, 66% of Texan freshmen were top ten percent students, and in 2008, top ten\npercent students made up 81% of the Texas freshmen seats. While the legislative 75% cap on\ntop ten percent enrollment may help alleviate some of the concerns with this plan, the fact\nremains that the Top Ten Percent Law operates today very differently than it did when first\nimplemented.\n       147\n           See Univ. of Tex. at Austin Office of Info.

By ignoring these other diversity\ncontributions, the Top Ten Percent Law restricts the University’s ability to\nachieve the maximum educational benefits of a truly diverse student body.150 As\nUT’s 2003 classroom study shows, percentage plans bear little promise of\nproducing the meaningful diverse interactions envisioned by Grutter, at least not\nin the classroom.          For instance, the study reported that although overall\nenrollment of minority students at UT rose significantly between 1996 and 2002,\nthe Fall 2002 schedule contained more classes with zero or one African American\nor Hispanic students than had the Fall 1996 schedule.151\n       Justice Ginsburg pointed out in Grutter’s companion case that percentage\nplans create damaging incentives to the education system. She observed that\n“[p]ercentage plans depend for their effectiveness on continued racial\nsegregation at the secondary school level.” These measures “encourage parents\n\n\n       149\n            For example, instead of admitting a minority top ten percent student from a\nlow-performing school, UT might admit a minority student with an interest in business who\nis just as academically qualified (and perhaps more so), but falls outside the top ten percent\nof his high school class because he attends a more competitive high school. This example also\ndemonstrates how the Top Ten Percent Law hurts academic selectivity: UT must admit a top\nten percent student from a low-performing high school before admitting a more qualified\nminority student who ranks just below the top ten percent at a highly competitive high school.\nThis effect, in turn, further widens the “credentials gap” between minority and non-minority\nstudents at the University, which risks driving away matriculating minority students from\ndifficult majors like business or the sciences.\n       150\n           The Top Ten Percent Law may produce diversity beyond varying hometowns,\nincluding differences in socioeconomic status and rural/urban/suburban upbringing. However,\nunder the Top Ten Percent Law, the University does not have the opportunity to select for a\nwide range of diverse experiences (such as travel abroad, extra-curricular involvement, or\nwork experience), so the Top Ten Percent Law bluntly operates as an attempt to create\ndiversity through reliance on perceived group characteristics and segregated communities.\n       151\n             2004 Proposal at 25 & tbl.8.\n\n                                                43\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 44 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nto keep their children in low-performing segregated schools, and discourage\nstudents from taking challenging classes that might lower their grade point\naverages.”152        Similarly, these plans create a strong incentive to avoid\ncompetitive educational institutions like magnet schools.153\n       Texas applicants falling outside the top ten percent group face extreme\ncompetition to gain admittance to the University. There are approximately\n16,000 students competing for only 1,216 fall admissions slots. The competition\nis so great that, on average, students admitted from outside the top ten percent\nof their high school class, regardless of race, have even higher SAT scores than\nthose granted automatic admission under the Top Ten Percent Law.154\nPerversely, this system negatively impacts minority students (who nationally\nhave lower standardized test scores) in the second decile of their classes at\ncompetitive high schools.            Grutter’s holistic look at race may soften this\nunreasonable exclusion of those second-decile minorities better qualified than\nmany of the non-minorities bluntly swept in under the Top Ten Percent Law.\nBut not much. It requires no empirical study to observe that those excluded\nunder this Law have been a rich source of Texas leaders over its history and that\nfor some applicants, admission to the flagship school of Texas is little more\npossible than admission to Harvard.155                That all of these weaknesses are\n\n       152\n             Gratz, 539 U.S. at 304 n.10 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).\n       153\n          In an effort to ameliorate this effect, a special provision of the Top Ten Percent Law\nprovides that “a high school magnet program, academy, or other special program” may be\nconsidered “an independent high school with its own graduating class separate from the\ngraduating class of other students attending the high school,” effectively allowing the school\nto certify two separate groups of Top Ten Percent Law students. See TEX . EDUC . CODE\n§ 51.8045.\n       154\n          See 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 12 tbl.6 (showing the average SAT range for top\nten percent and non-top ten percent students); id. at 13–15 tbls.6a–6d (displaying SAT ranges\nbased on race and top ten percent status).\n       155\n          To reach its target class size, UT offers fall admission to 10,200 Texas applicants.\nIshop Aff. (Dist. Ct. Dkt. No. 96, Tab 7) ¶ 12. For the class entering Fall 2008, after UT\noffered admission to top ten percent students, there were 1,216 admissions spots remaining.\n\n                                                44\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 45 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\napparent in the Top Ten Percent Law only make its focus upon race the\nplainer.156\n       The Top Ten Percent Law was adopted to increase minority enrollment.\nThat it has done, but its sweep of admissions is a polar opposite of the holistic\nfocus upon individuals.         Its internal proxies for race end-run the Supreme\nCourt’s studied structure for the use of race in university admissions decisions.\nIt casts aside testing historically relied upon, admitting many top ten percent\nminorities with significantly lower scores than rejected minorities and non-\nminorities alike.      That these admitted minorities are academically able to\nremain in the University does not respond to the reality that the Top Ten\nPercent Law eliminated the consideration of test scores, and correspondingly\nreduced academic selectivity, to produce increased enrollment of minorities.\nSuch costs may be intrinsic to affirmative action plans. If so, Grutter at least\n\n\n\n\n(The district court noted there were 841 places, but that number included the admission of so-\ncalled “Group A” applicants who have extremely high AI scores but are not in the top ten\npercent of their class. See id.) There were a total of 27,712 applicants for the fall class of\n2008. Statistical Handbook 2009–2010, at 25 tbl.S21. Neither the record nor any public\ninformation released by the University disclose what portion of that total applicant pool were\nTexas residents, but if we assume that proportion of applicants from Texas matches the 90%\nof admissions slots reserved for Texas applicants, one can estimate that there were 24,940\nTexas applicants. Subtracting the 8,984 students admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law\nyields an estimate of 15,956 applicants for 1,216 seats, or an acceptance rate of approximately\n7.6%. By comparison, the overall acceptance rate at Ivy League schools for the class entering\nFall 2008 ranged from 8% (Harvard) to 21% (Cornell). See The Rankings: Best National\nUniversities, U.S. NEW S & WORLD REP ., Sept. 2009, at 84–85.\n       156\n           Appellants here do not challenge the constitutionality of the Top Ten Percent Law.\nIn fact, they endorse it as a race-neutral alternative to the Grutter plan. A court considering\nthe constitutionality of the Law would examine whether Texas enacted the Law (and\ncorresponding admissions policies) because of its effects on identifiable racial groups or in spite\nof those effects.

The Top Ten Percent\nLaw is anything but narrow.\n      In short, while the Top Ten Percent Law appears to succeed in its central\npurpose of increasing minority enrollment, it comes at a high cost and is at best\na blunt tool for securing the educational benefits that diversity is intended to\nachieve. We cannot fault UT’s contention that the Top Ten Percent Law is\nplainly not the sort of workable race-neutral alternative that would be a\nconstitutionally mandated substitute for race-conscious university admissions\npolicies. We are keenly aware that the University turned to the Top Ten Percent\nLaw in response to a judicial ruling. Yet we cannot agree that it is irrelevant.\nTo the contrary, that the Top Ten Percent Law, accounting for the vast majority\nof in-state admissions, threatens to erode the foundations UT relies on to justify\nimplementing Grutter policies is a contention not lacking in force. “Facially\nneutral” has a talismanic ring in the law, but it can be misleading. It is here.\n\n\n                                 VII. CRITICAL MASS\n      Appellants contend that UT’s decision to reintroduce race-conscious\nadmissions was unconstitutional because minority enrollment already met or\nexceeded “critical mass” when this decision was made, and thus any further\nfacial consideration of race was neither warranted nor constitutional.\nAppellants claim the best measure of whether UT had attained the benefits of\ndiversity is the raw percentage of minorities enrolled.       As a result of the\ncombined effects of changing demographics, targeted high school programs, and\nthe Top Ten Percent Law, total minority enrollment had increased over the\nyears. When the decision was made to reintroduce race-conscious admissions in\n2004, underrepresented minorities made up 21.4% of the incoming class (4.5%\nAfrican-American and 16.9% Hispanic).157\n\n\n      157\n            Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We are confident, and hold, that\na Grutter-style admissions system standing alone is constitutional. That said,\nwhether to overlay such a plan with the Top Ten Percent Law and how to\ncalibrate its flow presents a Hobson’s choice between the minority students it\ncontributes and the test of constitutional bounds it courts. True enough, the Top\nTen Percent Law is in a sense, perhaps a controlling sense, a “facially” race-\nneutral plan. But it was animated by efforts to increase minority enrollment,\nand to the extent it succeeds it is because at key points it proxies for race.\n\n\n                                         A\n      Appellants propose various baseline levels of diversity which, they suggest,\nwould fully satisfy the University’s interest in attaining critical mass. They first\nargue that if “from 13.5 to 20.1 percent” minority enrollment was adjudged to be\ngreat enough diversity each year by Michigan’s Law School in Grutter, then the\n21.4% minority enrollment that UT had achieved prior to reintroducing\nrace-conscious admissions must already have achieved critical mass. We find\nthis comparison inapt for numerous reasons.\n      Appellants’ comparison presumes that critical mass must have some fixed\nupper bound that applies across different schools, different degrees, different\nstates, different years, different class sizes, and different racial and ethnic\nsubcomposition. It is based on Appellants’ continued insistence that the concept\nof critical mass is defined by the minimum threshold for minority students to\nhave their ideas represented in class discussions and not to feel isolated or like\nspokespersons for their race. As we have discussed, Grutter firmly rejects that\npremise and defines critical mass by reference to a broader view of diversity.\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 48 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\n      At oral argument, Appellants qualified this insistence and wisely conceded\nthat what constitutes critical mass in the eyes of one school might not suffice at\nanother. Grutter concerned a law school, whereas Appellants challenge UT’s\nundergraduate program. Michigan’s Law School operates on a national level,\nwhile UT focuses on recruiting and producing future leaders for Texas. The law\nschool enrolled approximately 350 students in its first-year class, few enough\nstudents that diversity in the student body readily approximates diversity in the\nclassroom. In contrast, UT enrolls approximately 7,000 undergraduates in its\nfirst-year class and has data showing diversity rates vary widely across\nindividual classrooms. African-Americans and Hispanics never represented\nmore than a combined 14.8% of the Michigan Law School’s applicant pool during\nthe examined time period,158 while those same underrepresented minorities were\n28% of UT’s freshman applicant pool for Fall 2008.159\n      Appellants point to the Supreme Court’s observation in United States v.\nVirginia that the Virginia Military Institute “could achieve at least 10% female\nenrollment—a sufficient critical mass to provide the female cadets with a\npositive educational experience.”160 But this figure, even if accurate, covers only\none component of the multi-faceted concept of diversity elaborated in Grutter.\nIn any event, the claim that 10% minority enrollment is a ceiling to critical mass\nis confounded by Grutter.\n      Appellants lastly note that minority enrollment at UT now exceeds the\nlevel it had reached in the mid-1990s, pre-Hopwood, when the University was\nfree to obtain any critical mass it wanted through overtly race-based decisions.\nUT responds that it has consistently maintained, both in the 2004 Proposal and\nbefore this Court, that even before Hopwood it had never reached critical\n\n\n      158\n            Grutter, 539 U.S. at 384 tbls.1–2 (Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting).\n      159\n            2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6 tbl.1.\n      160\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118056\"><a href=\"/opinion/118056/united-states-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                               48\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 49 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                         No. 09-50822\n\nmass.161 While UT was making a greater use of race in that era, its pursuit of\ndiversity was constrained by other interests, such as admitting only\nwell-qualified students. We cannot assume that diversity levels immediately\nbefore Hopwood were indicative of critical mass. Moreover, minority enrollment\nin 1996 is not indicative of UT’s true pre-Hopwood diversity. While admissions\ndecisions in 1996 were not controlled by Hopwood, the case impacted enrollment,\nresulting in fewer minority students.                If one instead compares minority\nenrollment from 1989 to 2004, a different picture emerges. In 2004, UT enrolled\nsignificantly fewer African-Americans than it had in 1989 (309 compared to 380).\nIn addition, the 2004 entering class consisted of only 100 more Hispanics than\nthe 1989 class, a low number considering the vast increases in the Hispanic\npopulation of Texas.             Further, the 2004 Proposal demonstrated that the\npercentage of diverse classrooms had declined since 1996.162 The decrease in\nclassroom diversity will only continue if additional minority representation is not\nachieved, as the University plans to increase its number of course offerings in\nfuture years. Finally, whatever levels of minority enrollment sufficed more than\na decade ago may no longer constitute critical mass today, given the social\nchanges Texas has undergone during the intervening years.                 Appellants’\nproposed baselines are insufficient reason to doubt UT’s considered, good faith\nconclusion that “the University still has not reached a critical mass at the\nclassroom level.” 163\n      Grutter pointedly refused to tie the concept of “critical mass” to any fixed\nnumber. The Grutter Court approved of the University of Michigan Law School’s\ngoal of attaining critical mass even though the school had specifically abjured\n\n\n\n      161\n            See, e.g., 2004 Proposal at 24 (“[R]estoration to pre-Hopwood levels is not\nsufficient.”).\n      162\n            Id. at 25 & tbl.8.\n      163\n            Id. at 24 (quoted in Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Rather, the legally cognizable interest—attaining a critical mass of\nunderrepresented minority students—“is defined by reference to the educational\nbenefits that diversity is designed to produce.”166 If a plaintiff produces evidence\nthat calls into question a university’s good faith pursuit of those educational\nbenefits, its race-conscious admissions policies may be found unconstitutional.\nWe are not persuaded, however, that any of the benchmarks suggested by\nAppellants succeed at calling that judgment into question.\n\n\n                                               B\n        As we have observed, benchmarks aside, UT’s claim that it has not yet\nachieved critical mass is less convincing when viewed against the backdrop of\nthe Top Ten Percent Law, which had already driven aggregate minority\nenrollment up to more than one-fifth of the University’s incoming freshman class\nbefore less subtle race-conscious admissions were reintroduced.\n        The chief difficulty with looking to aggregate minority enrollment is that\nit lumps together distinct minority groups from different backgrounds who may\nbring     various       unique    contributions    to   the   University   environment.\nAfrican-American and Hispanic students, for example, are not properly\n\n\n        164\n              Grutter, 539 U.S. at 318.\n        165\n              Id.\n        166\n              Id. at 330.\n\n                                              50\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 51 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                          No. 09-50822\n\ninterchangeable for purposes of determining critical mass, and a university must\nbe sensitive to important distinctions within these broad groups. In Parents\nInvolved, the Supreme Court specifically faulted two school districts for\nemploying “only a limited notion of diversity” that lumped together very\ndifferent racial groups.167 One school district classified students exclusively as\n“white” or “nonwhite”; another labeled them as “black” or “other.” 168 This “binary\nconception of race” runs headlong into the central teaching of Grutter and other\nprecedents which instruct that a university must give serious and flexible\nconsideration to all aspects of diversity.169\n        On this record, we must conclude that the University has acted with\nappropriate sensitivity to these distinctions. Although the aggregate number of\nunderrepresented minorities may be large, the enrollment statistics for\nindividual groups when UT decided to reintroduce race as a factor in admissions\ndecisions does not indicate critical mass was achieved. Further, we recognize\nthat some year-to-year fluctuation in enrollment numbers is inevitable, so\nstatistics from any single year lack probative force; the University needs to\nmaintain critical mass in years when yield is low just as it does when yield is\nhigh.\n        It is also apparent that UT has given appropriate consideration to whether\naggregate minority enrollment is translating into adequate diversity in the\nclassroom. Through two separate studies, the 2004 Proposal reached a serious\nand good faith determination that the aggregate number overstates the\nUniversity’s true level of diverse interaction.

Pointing to the Supreme Court’s\nrecent decision in Parents Involved, they argue that the University’s use of race\nis unnecessary, and therefore not narrowly tailored, because it has only a\n“minimal effect.” The district court thought this was an attempt “to force UT\ninto an impossible catch-22: on the one hand, it is well-established that to be\nnarrowly tailored the means ‘must be specifically and narrowly framed to\naccomplish’ the compelling interest, but on the other hand, according to\n[Appellants], the ‘narrowly tailored’ plan must have more than a minimal\neffect.” 170\n        Parents Involved does not support the cost-benefit analysis that Appellants\nseek to invoke. Rather, Parents Involved was primarily a critique of the school\ndistricts’ “extreme approach” that used binary racial categories to classify\nschoolchildren.171 The Court referred to the “minimal effect” sought by this\npolicy as evidence that other, more narrowly tailored means would be effective\nto serve the school districts’ interests.172            The Court did not hold that a\nGrutter-like system would be impermissible even after race-neutral alternatives\nhave been exhausted because the gains are small.

CONCLUSION\n      Mindful of the time frame of this case, we cannot say that under the\ncircumstances before us UT breached its obligation to undertake a “serious, good\nfaith consideration” before resorting to race-conscious measures; yet we speak\nwith caution. In this dynamic environment, our conclusions should not be taken\nto mean that UT is immune from its obligation to recalibrate its dual systems of\nadmissions as needed, and we cannot bless the university’s race-conscious\nadmissions program in perpetuity. Rather, much like judicial approval of a\nstate’s redistricting of voter districts, it is good only until the next census\ncount—it is more a process than a fixed structure that we review. The\nUniversity’s formal and informal review processes will confront the stark fact\nthat the Top Ten Percent Law, although soon to be restricted to 75% of the\nincoming class, increasingly places at risk the use of race in admissions. In\n1998, those admitted under the Top Ten Percent Law accounted for 41% of the\nTexas residents in the freshman class, while in 2008, top ten percent students\ncomprised 81% of enrolled Texan freshmen.174 This trajectory evidences a risk\nof eroding the necessity of using race to achieve critical mass with accents that\nmay, if persisted in, increasingly present as an effort to meet quantitative goals\ndrawn from the demographics of race and a defiance of the now-demanded focus\nupon individuals when considering race.\n      A university may decide to pursue the goal of a diverse student body, and\nit may do so to the extent it ties that goal to the educational benefits that flow\nfrom diversity. The admissions procedures that UT adopted, modeled after the\n\n\n      173\n            Id. at 790 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).\n      174\n            2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 7 tbl.1a.\n\n                                               53\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 54 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\nplan approved by the Supreme Court in Grutter, are narrowly tailored—\nprocedures in some respects superior to the Grutter plan because the University\ndoes not keep a running tally of underrepresented minority representation\nduring the admissions process. We are satisfied that the University’s decision\nto reintroduce race-conscious admissions was adequately supported by the\n“serious, good faith consideration” required by Grutter. Finally, it is neither our\nrole nor purpose to dance from Grutter’s firm holding that diversity is an interest\nsupporting compelling necessity. Nor are we inclined to do so. The role of black\nathletes in the southern universities forty years ago presents diversity’s\npotential better than can we, although at that early juncture, it was ability\novercoming a barrier of race.175\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n      175\n           See David K.

GARZA, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\n      Whenever a serious piece of judicial writing strays from fundamental\nprinciples of constitutional law, there is usually a portion of such writing where\nthose principles are articulated, but not followed. So it goes in Grutter, where\na majority of the Court acknowledged strict scrutiny as the appropriate level of\nreview for race-based preferences in university admissions, but applied a level\nof scrutiny markedly less demanding.        To be specific, race now matters in\nuniversity admissions, where, if strict judicial scrutiny were properly applied,\nit should not.\n      Today, we follow Grutter’s lead in finding that the University of Texas’s\nrace-conscious admissions program satisfies the Court’s unique application of\nstrict scrutiny in the university admissions context. I concur in the majority\nopinion, because, despite my belief that Grutter represents a digression in the\ncourse of constitutional law, today’s opinion is a faithful, if unfortunate,\napplication of that misstep. The Supreme Court has chosen this erroneous path\nand only the Court can rectify the error.

See\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 280 n.6 (plurality opinion) (the “term ‘narrowly tailored’ .\n. . requires consideration of whether lawful alternative and less restrictive\nmeans could have been used.”); see also Adarand, 515 U.S. at 237–38; Croson,\n488 U.S. at 507; Fullilove v.

Programs employing a quota system would fail this\ninquiry, as would programs of unlimited duration. See Bakke, 438 U.S. at\n315–18; Croson, 488 U.S. at 498. The Court looked to a program’s flexibility and\nits capacity for individualized consideration. See United States v.

See Croson, 488 U.S. at 506–10. Finally,\nthe Court considered the program’s burden on innocent third parties. See, e.g.,\nMetro Broad., Inc. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112484\"><a href=\"/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 630 (1990) (O’Connor, J., dissenting)\n(programs should not “unduly burden individuals who are not members of the\nfavored racial and ethnic groups”); Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n      Grutter changed this. After finding that racial diversity at the University\nof Michigan Law School (“Law School”) was a compelling governmental interest,\nthe Court redefined the meaning of narrow tailoring. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n387 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“The Court, however, does not apply strict\nscrutiny. By trying to say otherwise, it undermines both the test and its own\ncontrolling precedents.”); see generally Ian Ayres & Sydney Foster, Don’t Tell,\nDon’t Ask: Narrow Tailoring After Grutter and Gratz, 85 T EX . L. R EV. 517\n(2007). The Court replaced narrow tailoring’s conventional “least restrictive\nmeans” requirement with a regime that encourages opacity and is incapable of\nmeaningful judicial review under any level of scrutiny. Courts now simply\nassume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that university\nadministrators have acted in good faith in pursuing racial diversity, and courts\nare required to defer to their educational judgments on how best to achieve it.\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 328–29. What is more, the deference called for in Grutter\nseems to allow universities, rather than the courts, to determine when the use\nof racial preferences is no longer compelling. See id. at 343 (“We take the Law\nSchool at its word that it would ‘like nothing better than to find a race-neutral\nadmissions formula’ and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program\nas soon as practicable.”). This new species of strict scrutiny ensures that only\nthose admissions programs employing the most heavy-handed racial preferences,\nand those programs foolish enough to maintain and provide conclusive data, will\nbe subject to “exacting judicial examination.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 904. Others,\n\n                                        59\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 60 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\nlike the University of Michigan in Grutter, and the University of Texas here, can\nget away with something less.\n                                         B\n      Setting aside for a moment Grutter’s finding that racial diversity within\nthe Law School was a compelling state interest, see infra Sections I.D and III, I\nfind troubling the Court’s treatment of whether the Law School’s chosen\nmeans—using race as a “plus” factor—was narrowly tailored to achieving that\nend. The Court discussed five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored race-conscious\nadmissions program in answering this question: (1) the absence of quotas; (2) a\nprogram that does not unduly harm any racial group; (3) serious, good-faith\nconsideration of race-neutral alternatives; (4) a program that contains a sunset\nprovision or some logical end point; and (5) individualized consideration of all\napplicants. See 539 U.S. at 335–43. The Court’s opinion effectively emptied at\nleast three of these criteria of their probative content, leaving the first and fifth\nas determinative in any narrow tailoring inquiry. See Ayres & Foster, 85 T EX.\nL. R EV. at 543.\n      First, Grutter defined a quota as reserving a fixed number or percentage\nof opportunities for certain minority groups, and insulating individuals from\nthose groups from competition with all other candidates for available seats. Id.\nat 333–36. These prohibitions were clear well before Grutter. See Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 317; Croson, 488 U.S. at 496. Only those programs with overt numerical\nset-asides or separate minority admissions tracks would fail this requirement.\n      Next, the Court found that race-conscious admissions programs do not\nunduly burden innocent third parties so long as they provide individualized\nconsideration. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341 (“[I]n the context of its individualized\ninquiry into the possible diversity contributions of all applicants, the Law\nSchool’s race-conscious admissions program does not unduly harm nonminority\n\n\n\n                                         60\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 61 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\napplicants.”). Here, the Court collapsed the second narrow tailoring criterion\ninto the fifth.\n      Grutter also held that there were no workable race-neutral alternatives at\nthe Law School, such as “using a lottery system” or “decreasing the emphasis for\nall applicants on undergraduate GPA and LSAT scores.” Id. at 340. The Court\nlikewise rejected the United States’ argument that the Law School’s plan was\nnot narrowly tailored because race-neutral alternatives that had proven effective\nelsewhere (i.e., the percentage plans utilized in California, Florida, and Texas)\nwere available and would deliver the educational benefits the Law School was\nseeking. Id. The Court held that “[n]arrow tailoring does not require exhaustion\nof every conceivable race-neutral alternative. . . . Narrow tailoring does,\nhowever, require serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.” Id. at 339.\nAfter Grutter, universities are no longer required to use the most effective race-\nneutral means. So long as admissions officials have given “serious, good faith\nconsideration” to such programs, they are free to pursue less effective\nalternatives that serve the interest “about as well.” Id. (citing Wygant, 476 U.S.\nat 280 n.6 (plurality opinion)). Thus, this third criterion is now essentially\nwithout meaning. Given the deference that universities’ educational judgments\nare to be afforded post-Grutter, “serious, good faith consideration” is a peculiarly\nlow bar that will be satisfied in most every case. Compare id. at 339 (narrow\ntailoring “require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives”), with id. at 329 (“[G]ood faith on the part of a university is\n‘presumed’ absent a showing to the contrary.”) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n      Finally, while the Court acknowledged that race-conscious admissions\nprograms must be limited in time, such as by sunset provisions or periodic\nreviews to determine whether the preferences remain necessary, the Court\n\n                                        61\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 62 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\nsuspended application of this criterion for twenty-five years. Id. at 343 (“We\nexpect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be\nnecessary to further the interest approved today.”). In doing so, the Grutter\nmajority simply accepted the Law School’s promise that it would terminate its\nrace-conscious policies as soon as possible. See id. at 343 (“We take the Law\nSchool at its word that it would ‘like nothing better than to find a race-neutral\nadmissions formula’ and will terminate its race-conscious admissions program\nas soon as practicable.”). The Court’s approval here is remarkable given the\nconstitutional gravity of this experiment (i.e., the Law School’s allocation of\npreferences along racial lines). This fourth criterion will now be considered\nsatisfied with little or no showing on the part of university administrators, at\nleast until 2028.\n      And thus, all that truly remains of strict scrutiny’s narrow tailoring\ninquiry post-Grutter is the requirement of “individualized consideration.” But\nwhat does this term mean specifically? Grutter never tells us. Moreover, the\nweight given to race as part of this individualized consideration is purposefully\nleft undefined, making meaningful judicial review all but impossible.\n                                       C\n      In Grutter, the University of Michigan Law School sought to achieve a\nstudent body that was both academically strong and diverse along several\ndimensions, including race. There, the Court endorsed the Law School’s “highly\nindividualized, holistic review    of each applicant’s file, giving serious\nconsideration to all the ways an applicant might contribute to a diverse\neducational environment.” Id. at 337. The Court noted approvingly that the\nLaw School had “no policy . . . of automatic acceptance or rejection based on any\nsingle ‘soft’ variable.” Id. The Grutter majority permitted the use of race and\n\n\n\n\n                                       62\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 63 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nethnicity as “plus” factors within the Law School’s holistic review, but this\nsimply raises the question: how much of a plus?2 Grutter did not say.\n       Instead, the Court implicitly forbade universities from quantifying racial\npreferences in their admissions calculus. Contrasting the admissions system\nfound unconstitutional in Gratz, the Grutter majority noted that “the Law School\nawards no mechanical, predetermined diversity ‘bonuses’ based on race or\nethnicity.” Id. (citing Gratz v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 271–72 (2003)). On this\nview, rigid point systems that allocate preference points for racial and ethnic\nstatus are unconstitutional because they “preclude[] admissions counselors from\nconducting the type of individualized consideration the Court’s opinion in\nGrutter requires.” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 277 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (citation\nomitted).\n       But it is not clear, to me at least, how using race in the holistic scoring\nsystem approved in Grutter is constitutionally distinct from the point-based\nsystem rejected in Gratz.3 If two applicants, one a preferred minority and one\nnonminority, with application packets identical in all respects save race would\nbe assigned the same score under a holistic scoring system, but one gets a higher\nscore when race is factored in, how is that different from the mechanical group-\nbased boost prohibited in Gratz? Although one system quantifies the preference\n\n\n       2\n        The Court’s discussion of race as a “plus” factor takes place in the context of strict\nscrutiny’s narrow tailoring inquiry. Whether race should be considered at all is a separate,\nmore fundamental, matter. See infra Section III.\n       3\n         Although I do not believe the government’s use of race in university admissions can\never serve a compelling interest, assuming that it can, there is no reason why a well-designed\npoint system could not account for an applicant’s race, among other variables, and yet still\nprovide meaningful, individualized consideration. See Ayres & Foster, 85 TEX. L. REV. at\n566–70; see also Gratz, 539 U.S. at 295 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[I]t is hard to see what is\ninappropriate in assigning some stated value to a relevant characteristic, whether it be\nreasoning ability, writing style, running speed, or minority race. Justice Powell’s plus factors\nnecessarily are assigned some values. The college simply does by a numbered scale what the\nlaw school accomplishes in its ‘holistic review’; the distinction does not imply that applicants\nto the undergraduate college are denied individualized consideration . . . .” (citation omitted)).\n\n                                               63\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 64 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nand the other does not, the result is the same: a determinative benefit based on\nrace.\n        Grutter’s new terminology like “individualized consideration” and “holistic\nreview” tends to conceal this result. By obscuring the University of Michigan’s\nuse of race in these diffuse tests, the Court allowed the Law School to do covertly\nwhat the undergraduate program could not do overtly. See Gratz, 539 U.S. at\n270–76.     This much is clear and has been discussed elsewhere.4                    I write\nseparately to add my view, confirmed while deciding this appeal, that Grutter’s\nnarrow      tailoring   inquiry—now        reduced     to   testing   for   individualized\nconsideration—is incapable of meaningful judicial review.\n        Traditionally, strict scrutiny required that the overall benefits of programs\nemploying racial classifications justified the overall costs.5 See Ayres & Foster,\n85 T EX. L. R EV. at 526 & n.38. In Grutter, not only did the Court fail to conduct\nsuch an analysis, it rejected the only means for measuring the constitutionally\nrelevant costs and benefits. Id. Although I disagree with the Court that race-\nconscious policies can ever serve a compelling interest in university admissions,\nby prohibiting race and ethnicity from being quantified at all, Grutter eliminated\nany chance for courts to critically evaluate whether race is, in fact, the defining\nfeature of an admissions packet. Post-Grutter, there is no way to assess how\nmuch of a “plus” race gets as a plus-factor in any admissions system. And\nwithout the ability to measure the number of “but-for” admits (i.e., admitted\nminority students for whom race was the decisive factor), courts cannot\n\n\n\n        4\n        See, e.g., Larry Alexander & Maimon Schwarzschild, Grutter or Otherwise: Racial\nPreferences and Higher Education, 21 CONST. COMMENT. 3 (2004); CHEMERINSKY,\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW 744.\n        5\n         For example, a race-conscious admissions policy that added just one, three, or five\nmembers of a preferred minority group to an enrolling class of 6,700 would fail to be narrowly\ntailored. Such a program would have an intolerably high cost for little return. See infra\nSection II.\n\n                                             64\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 65 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nmeaningfully evaluate whether a university’s use of race fits its asserted interest\nnarrowly. See id. at 527–41, 575–82.6 In short, it is impossible to subject such\nuses of race to strict scrutiny.        Grutter rewards admissions programs that\nremain opaque.\n       Even assuming the Court’s “educational benefits of diversity” justification\nholds true, see infra Section I.D, there are far more effective race-neutral means\nof screening for the educational benefits that states like Michigan and Texas\nostensibly seek. To the degree that state universities genuinely desire students\nwith diverse backgrounds and experiences, race-neutral factors like specific\nhardships overcome, extensive travel, leadership positions held, volunteer and\nwork experience, dedication to particular causes, and extracurricular activities,\namong many other variables, can be articulated with specificity in the\nadmissions essays.7 These markers for viewpoint diversity are far more likely\nto translate into enhanced classroom dialogue than a blanket presumption that\nrace will do the same. Moreover, these markers represent the kind of life\nexperiences that reflect industry. Race cannot. While race inevitably colors an\nindividual’s life and views, that facet of race and its impact on the individual can\nbe described with some precision through an admissions essay. We should not\n\n\n\n       6\n        See also id. at 528 n.42 (citing, inter alia, WILLIAM G.

Such a policy, however labeled,\nis not narrowly tailored.\n      Finally, the Court’s unusual deference to educators’ academic judgments\nthat racial diversity is a compelling interest, coupled with the deference\nallegedly owed to their determination of when the use of race is no longer\nnecessary, see id. at 343, would appear to permit race-based policies indefinitely.\nFor example, notwithstanding that a university’s race-conscious policies had\nachieved 25% African-American and 25% Hispanic enrollment in the student\nbody generally, that university could still justify the use of race in admissions\nif these minority students were disproportionately bunched in a small number\nof classes or majors. In fact, the majority’s application of Grutter today reaches\njust such a result.\n      Despite Top Ten Percent’s demonstrable impact on minority enrollment\nat the University of Texas, the majority opinion holds that the University’s use\nof race in admissions can be justified by reference to the paucity of minority\nstudents in certain majors:\n      While the [Top Ten Percent] Law may have contributed to an\n      increase in overall minority enrollment, those minority students\n      remain clustered in certain programs, severely limiting the\n      beneficial effects of educational diversity. For example, nearly a\n      quarter of the undergraduate students in UT’s College of Social\n      Work are Hispanic, and more than 10% are African-American. In\n      the College of Education, 22.4% of students are Hispanic and 10.1%\n      are African-American. By contrast, in the College of Business\n      Administration, only 14.5% of the students are Hispanic and 3.4%\n      are African-American. It is evident that if UT is to have diverse\n      interactions, it needs more minority students who are interested in\n      and meet the requirements for a greater variety of colleges, not\n      more students disproportionately enrolled in certain programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        66\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 67 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\nAnte at 42. If this is so, a university’s asserted interested in racial diversity\ncould justify race-conscious policies until such time as educators certified that\nthe elusive critical mass had finally been attained, not merely in the student\nbody generally, but major-by-major and classroom-by-classroom.\n      Given the “large-scale absence of African-American and Hispanic students\nfrom thousands of classes” at the University of Texas, Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n607, today’s decision ratifies the University’s reliance on race at the\ndepartmental and classroom levels, and will, in practice, allow for race-based\npreferences in seeming perpetuity. Such a use of race “has no logical stopping\npoint” and is not narrowly tailored. See Croson, 488 U.S. at 498 (citing Wygant,\n476 U.S. at 275). Allowing race-based social engineering at the university level\nis one thing, but not nearly as invasive as condoning it at the classroom level.\nI cannot accept that the Fourteenth Amendment permits this level of granularity\nto justify dividing students along racial lines.\n                                         D\n      The same imprecision that characterizes Grutter’s narrow tailoring\nanalysis casts doubt on its discussion of racial diversity as a compelling state\ninterest.   Grutter found that the Law School had a compelling interest in\n“securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body,” and that achieving\na “critical mass” of racially diverse students was necessary to accomplish that\ngoal. Id. at 333. The Law School defined “critical mass” as “a number that\nencourages underrepresented minority students to participate in the classroom\nand not feel isolated . . . or like spokespersons for their race.” Id. at 318–19. The\nCourt clarified: “critical mass is defined by reference to the educational benefits\nthat diversity is designed to produce.” Id. at 330. Justice O’Connor’s majority\nopinion identified three such constitutionally relevant benefits: (i) increased\nperspective in the classroom; (ii) improved professional training; and (iii)\nenhanced civic engagement. Id. at 330–33.

This\nrationale conforms to Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke that universities should\npursue “[t]he atmosphere of speculation, excitement and creation” that is\n“promoted by a diverse student body.” 438 U.S. at 312 (opinion of Powell, J.).9\nI question the validity of this surmise.\n\n       8\n         See Robert C.

REV. 4, 59–60 (2003) (“Although Grutter\ncasts itself as merely endorsing Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke, Grutter’s analysis of\ndiversity actually differs quite dramatically from Powell’s. Powell conceptualized diversity as\na value intrinsic to the educational process itself. He regarded diversity as essential to ‘the\nquality of higher education,’ because education was a practice of enlightenment, ‘of\nspeculation, experiment, and creation,’ that thrived on the ‘robust exchange of ideas;\ncharacteristically provoked by confrontation between persons of distinct life experiences. . .\n.

That classroom\ndiscussion is, in fact, being enhanced? How can a party prove that it is? How\ncan an opposing party prove that it is not?\n       My concern with allowing viewpoint diversity’s alleged benefits to justify\nracial preference is that viewpoint diversity is too theoretical and abstract. It\ncannot be proved or disproved.

Id. at 330. But this support can be easily manipulated.11 If all a\nuniversity “need do is find . . . report[s],” studies, or surveys to implement a race-\nconscious admissions policy, “the constraints of the Equal Protection Clause will,\nin effect, have been rendered a nullity.” Croson, 488 U.S. at 504; see also J.E.B.\nv.

This inference is based on the assumption that\nmembers of minority groups, because of their racial status, are likely to have\nunique experiences and perspectives incapable of expression by individuals from\noutside that group. But as the Court has recognized elsewhere, the Constitution\nprohibits state decisionmakers from presuming that groups of individuals,\nwhether classified by race, ethnicity, or gender, share such a quality collectively.\nSee Miller, 515 U.S. at 914 (the Equal Protection Clause forbids “the demeaning\nnotion that members of the defined racial groups ascribe to certain ‘minority\nviews’ that must be different from those of other citizens.”) (citation omitted).\nThere is no one African-American or Hispanic viewpoint,12 and, in fact, Grutter\napproved the Law School’s diversity rationale precisely because of the role that\nracial diversity can play in dispelling such falsehoods. See id. at 320 (citing\nexpert testimony suggesting that “when a critical mass of underrepresented\nminority students is present, racial stereotypes lose their force because\nnonminority students learn there is no ‘minority viewpoint’ but rather a variety\nof viewpoints among minority students.”); and id. at 333 (“[D]iminishing the\nforce of such stereotypes is a crucial part of the Law School’s mission, and one\nthat it cannot accomplish with only token numbers of minority students.”).\n\n\n\n       12\n          For example, life experiences differ significantly if a Hispanic student’s ethnicity\noriginates in Mexico as opposed to Spain, or, for that matter, any of various Central and South\nAmerican countries. Likewise, an African-American student whose roots come from Nigeria\nwould be distinct in culture and ethnicity from a student whose ancestry originated in Egypt\nor Haiti. This same principle applies for students from non-preferred racial classes. For\nexample, second-generation students from English, Irish, Scottish, or Australian ancestry\nwould come with very different cultural experiences, and yet all of these students would be\ngrouped together as “White” in racial classification systems like the one used at the University\nof Texas.\n\n                                              70\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 71 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\n      Grutter sought to have it both ways. The Court held that racial diversity\nwas necessary to eradicate the notion that minority students think and behave,\nnot as individuals, but as a race. At the same time, the Court approved a policy\ngranting race-based preferences on the assumption that racial status correlates\nwith greater diversity of viewpoints.\n                                        2\n      Grutter’s second asserted educational benefit of diversity relates to\nimproved professional training. Here, Justice O’Connor writes that diversity\n“promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes,\nand enables students to better understand persons of different races.” Id. at 330\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Such training is essential, the\nargument goes, for future leaders who will eventually work within and supervise\na racially diverse workforce. Id. at 330–31.\n      State universities are free to define their educational goals as broadly as\nneeded to serve the public interest.         We defer to educators’ professional\njudgments in setting those goals. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 328 (“Our holding today\nis in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university’s\nacademic decisions, within constitutionally proscribed limits.”). My concern,\ndiscussed throughout this opinion, is not that Grutter commands such deference,\nbut that it conflated the deference owed to a university’s asserted interest with\ndeference to the means used to attain it. See id. at 388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)\n(“The Court confuses deference to a university’s definition of its educational\nobjective with deference to the implementation of this goal.”).\n      There is, however, one aspect of the Court’s “improved professional\ntraining” rationale that I find especially troubling. While Grutter made much\nof the role that educational institutions play in providing professional training,\nsee id. at 331 (“We have repeatedly acknowledged the overriding importance of\npreparing students for work and citizenship”), the cases the Court relied on\n\n                                        71\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 72 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\ninvolved primary and secondary schools. See id. (citing Plyer v.

I question\nwhether these cases apply with equal force in the context of higher education,\nwhere academic goals are vastly different from those pursued in elementary and\nsecondary schools. Moreover, a university’s self-styled educational goals, for\nexample, promoting “cross-racial understanding” and enabling students “to\nbetter understand persons of different races,” could just as easily be facilitated\nin many other public settings where diverse people assemble regularly: in the\nworkplace, in primary and secondary schools, and in social and community\ngroups. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 347–48 (Scalia, J., dissenting). I do not believe\nthat the university has a monopoly on furthering these societal goals, or even\nthat the university is in the best position to further such goals. Notwithstanding\nan institution’s decision to expand its educational mission more broadly, the\nuniversity’s core function is to educate students in the physical sciences,\nengineering, social sciences, business and the humanities, among other academic\ndisciplines.\n                                         3\n      Finally, Grutter articulated a third benefit of racial diversity in higher\neducation: enhancing civic engagement. Here, the Court wrote that:\n      Effective participation by members of all racial and ethnic groups in\n      the civic life of our Nation is essential if the dream of one Nation,\n      indivisible, is to be realized.\n      ...\n      In order to cultivate a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of\n      the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be visibly\n      open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and\n      ethnicity. All members of our heterogeneous society must have\n      confidence in the openness and integrity of educational institutions\n      that provide this training. . . . Access to [higher] education . . . must\n\n                                         72\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 73 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       be inclusive of talented and qualified individuals of every race and\n       ethnicity, so that all members of our heterogeneous society may\n       participate in the educational institutions that provide the training\n       and education necessary to succeed in America.\n\nId. at 332–33.\n       Unlike the first two “educational benefits of diversity,” which focused on\nimproving classroom discussion and professional training, this third claimed\nbenefit plainly has nothing to do with the university’s core education and\ntraining functions. Instead, Grutter is concerned here with role that higher\neducation plays in a democratic society, and the Court suggests that affirmative\naction at public universities can advance a societal goal of encouraging minority\nparticipation in civic life.13 This proposition lacks foundation.\n       If a significant portion of a minority community sees our nation’s leaders\nas illegitimate or lacks confidence in the integrity of our educational institutions,\nas Grutter posits in the block quote above, see id., 539 U.S. at 332, I doubt that\nsuspending the prevalent constitutional rules to allow preferred treatment for\nas few as 15-40 students, see infra Section II, is likely to foster renewed civic\nparticipation from among that community as a whole.14\n       Grutter replaced Bakke’s emphasis on diversity in educational inputs with\na new emphasis on diversity in educational outputs. By expanding Justice\n\n\n       13\n          See Lani Guinier, The Supreme Court, 2002 Term—Comment: Admissions Rituals\nas Political Acts: Guardians at the Gates of Our Democratic Ideals, 117 HARV. L. REV. 113,\n174–76 (2003).\n       14\n          This is not to criticize universities, like the University of Texas, for implementing\npolicies that seek to increase minority representation, not merely for its educational benefits\non campus, but also for the secondary benefits that such increases in minority enrollment can\nhave in the workplace and in society generally. A university degree confers professional and\nleadership opportunities unavailable otherwise, and ensuring that all segments of society have\nmeaningful access to public institutions of higher education “represents a paramount\ngovernment objective.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331–32 (citing Brief of United States as Amicus\nCuriae 13). I do not question this goal, but rather the constitutionality of using race to attain\nit.\n\n                                               73\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 74 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-50822\n\nPowell’s original viewpoint diversity rationale to include diversity’s putative\nbenefits in the workforce and beyond (i.e., inspiring a sense of civic belonging in\ndiscouraged minority communities), the Court has endorsed a compelling\ninterest without bounds.       Post-Grutter, it matters little whether racial\npreferences in university admissions are justified by reference to their potential\nfor improved discussion in individual classrooms, or even at the university\ngenerally. Now such preferences can be justified based on their global impact.\nBy removing the focus of attention from diversity’s educational value at the\ncampus level, the Court has ensured that the “educational benefits of diversity”\nwill accommodate all university affirmative action plans as compelling.\n                                         E\n      Finally, by using metaphors, like “critical mass,” and indefinite terms that\nlack conceptual or analytical precision, but rather sound in abject subjectivity,\nto dress up constitutional standards, Grutter fails to provide any predictive value\nto courts and university administrators tasked with applying these standards\nconsistently. And notwithstanding the Court’s nod to federalism, Grutter’s\nambiguity discourages States from experimenting or departing from the one\naccepted norm. See id. at 342 (citing United States v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581\n(1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[T]he States may perform their role as\nlaboratories for experimentation to devise various solutions where the best\nsolution is far from clear.”)). In the absence of clear guidance, public universities\nnationwide will simply model their programs after the one approved in Grutter\nrather than struggle with the risks and uncertain benefits of experimentation.\nThat is exactly what has occurred here. With one exception—the Top Ten\nPercent law—the race-conscious admissions policy that we review today is\nidentical to the program used at the Law School.\n\n\n\n\n                                         74\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 75 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\n                                            II\n       As mentioned at the outset, I concur in the opinion because I believe\ntoday’s decision is a faithful application of Grutter’s teachings, however flawed\nI may find those teachings to be. I am compelled to follow the Court’s unusual\ndeference towards public university administrators in their assessment that\nracial diversity is a compelling interest, as well as the Court’s refashioned\nnarrow-tailoring inquiry. See 28 U.S.C. § 453. My difficulty is not necessarily\nwith today’s decision, but with the one that drives it. Nonetheless, there is one\naspect of Judge Higginbotham’s thoughtful opinion that gives me pause about\nwhether Grutter compels the result we reach today. Ultimately, and regrettably,\nI recognize that the deference called for by Grutter may make this concern\nsuperfluous.\n       As today’s opinion notes, the University of Texas’s race-conscious\nadmissions policy is nearly indistinguishable from the program approved by the\nSupreme Court in Grutter.15        Ante at 2, 4, 25. As such, the majority opinion\nsummarily finds that, like the Law School in Grutter, the University of Texas\nhas a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits of diversity in its\nundergraduate program. Id. at 26. After affording all deference due, today’s\ndecision focuses on the efficacy of the University’s race-conscious admissions\npolicy. Id. at 29 (“[W]hile we focus on the University’s decision to adopt a\nGrutter-like plan, admissions outcomes remain relevant evidence of the plan’s\nnecessity—a reality check.”). In my view, the efficacy of the University’s race-\nbased admissions policy is more than merely relevant, it is dispositive.\n       The plaintiffs here argue that the University of Texas’s interest in\nobtaining a racially diverse student body is not compelling because the\nUniversity has already achieved critical mass by way of Texas’s Top Ten Percent\n\n      15\n        As a result, UT’s policy suffers from all the same defects as the Law School policy\nevaluated in Grutter and discussed previously in this opinion. See supra Section I.\n\n                                            75\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 76 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-50822\n\nlaw. See T EX. E DUC. C ODE § 51.803 (1997). The University disagrees. This\nclaim is difficult to evaluate. The University refuses to assign a weight to race\nor to maintain conclusive data on the degree to which race factors into\nadmissions decisions and enrollment yields. See Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n608–09 (“At no point in the process is race considered individually or given a\nnumerical value; instead, the file is evaluated in its entirety in order to provide\na better understanding of the student as a person and place her achievements\nin context.”). Whether the University of Texas’s use of race is narrowly tailored\nturns on whether its chosen means—using race as a plus factor in the\nUniversity’s holistic scoring system—are effective, not just in theory, but also in\npractice.\n       If, apart from the Top Ten Percent law, the University of Texas’s race-\nconscious admissions program added just three-to-five African-American\nstudents, or five-to-ten Hispanic students, to an entering freshman class of\n6,700, that policy would completely fail to achieve its aims and would not be\nnarrowly tailored. See Ayres & Foster, 85 T EX. L. R EV. at 523 n.27 (“At least as\na theoretical matter, narrow tailoring requires not only that the preferences not\nbe too large, but also that they not be too small so as to fail to achieve the goals\nof the relevant compelling government interest.”). The marginal benefit of\nadding just five or ten minority students to a class of this size would be\nnegligible and have no perceptible impact on the “educational benefits that\ndiversity is designed to produce.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 330 (“[C]ritical mass is\ndefined by reference to the educational benefits that diversity is designed to\nproduce.”).16 This is especially so, if, as the district court suggests, “the large-\n\n\n       16\n         See Bakke, 438 U.S. at 316 (opinion of Powell, J.)

For classes with five to 24 students—the most likely to foster the\nvibrant discussion described in Grutter and Bakke—the figures are more revealing. In 2002,\nUT offered 3,616 classes with five to 24 students. Of these, 90% had one or zero African-\nAmerican students and 43% had one or zero Hispanic students.

First, this case asks us to decide the necessity of UT’s race-conscious\n\n                                             77\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 78 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\nAutomatic Admissions Law (HB 588) at the University of Texas at Austin,\nOctober 28, 2008 at 7 (“2008 Top Ten Percent Report”). 5,114 (80.9% of enrolled\nTexas residents) of these students were a product of Top Ten Percent, meaning\nthat, at most, 1,208 (19.1%) enrolled non-Top Ten Percent Texas residents had\nbeen evaluated on the basis of their AI/PAI scores. Id.\n       Of the 363 African-American freshmen from Texas high schools that were\nadmitted and enrolled (6% of the 6,322-member enrolling class from Texas high\nschools), 305 (4.8%) were a product of Top Ten Percent, while 58 (0.92%) African-\nAmerican enrollees had been evaluated on the basis of their AI/PAI scores.20 See\n2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 7. For the 1,322 (21%) total enrolled in-state\nHispanic students, 1,164 (18.4% of enrolled in-state students) were a product\nof Top Ten Percent, while 158 (2.5%) had been evaluated on the basis of their\nAI/PAI scores. Id. We know that in some cases an applicants’ AI score is high\nenough that the applicant is granted admission based on that score alone. But\nwe do not have data to show how many of these 58 African-American and 158\nHispanic students were admitted automatically based on their AI scores, which\nare race-neutral, and how many were admitted after factoring in the students’\n\n\n\nadmissions policy in light of Texas’s Top Ten Percent law. I find this question is evaluated\nmost effectively by comparing enrollment data for Texas residents, which include precise\nfigures for Top 10% and Non-Top 10% enrollees. Second, as the majority opinion recognizes,\nante at 44 n.155, the record does not include data showing what portion of the total applicant\npool were Texas residents and what portion came from out-of-state. This is problematic. We\nknow, for example, that the 2008 entering freshman class included 375 African-American and\n1,338 Hispanic students, and that 363 and 1,322 of these students, respectively, were Texas\nresidents. See 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6–7. So, although we know that the 2008\nenrolling freshman class included 12 African-American and 16 Hispanic students from out-of-\nstate, we cannot intelligently discuss the potential impact of UT’s race-conscious policy on this\ndata set without also having total application and admissions information available for non-\nTexas residents. This does not affect my conclusions—the number of non-Texas African-\nAmerican and Hispanic students enrolled in the freshman class is statistically insignificant.\n       20\n         In this section, I often refer to a raw number followed by a percentage listed in\nparentheses. E.g., “305 (4.8%).” This percentage figure (__%) is calculated by dividing number\nof students cited by 6,322, the number of enrolled Texas residents in the 2008 freshman class.\n\n                                               78\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 79 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-50822\n\nPAI scores, which use the University’s Grutter-like holistic evaluation plan and\ninclude consideration of an applicant’s race as one of seven “special\ncircumstances.” Nonetheless, assuming that all 58 and 158 African-American\nand Hispanic students, respectively, were admitted on the basis of their\ncombined AI and PAI scores (i.e., that none of these minority students gained\nadmission on the basis of their race-neutral Academic Index score alone), the\nquestion is whether the University’s use of race, which is a “highly suspect tool,”\nCroson, 488 U.S. at 493, as part of the PAI score contributes a statistically\nsignificant enough number of minority students to affect critical mass at the\nUniversity of Texas.\n      We do not know, because the University does not maintain data, the\ndegree to which race influenced the University’s admissions decisions for any of\nthese enrolled students or how many of these students would not have been\nadmitted but-for the use of race as a plus factor. But assuming the University\ngave race decisive weight in each of these 58 African-American and 158 Hispanic\nstudents’ admissions decisions, those students would still only constitute 0.92%\nand 2.5%, respectively, of the entire 6,322-person enrolling in-state freshman\nclass. And this is assuming a 100%, unconstitutional use of race, not as a plus\nfactor, but as a categorical condition for guaranteed admission. See Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 329–30 (making race an automatic factor in admissions would “amount\nto outright racial balancing, which is patently unconstitutional.”).\n      Assume further, that such a prohibited use of race was employed in only\nhalf of the University’s admissions decisions. This would still only yield 29\n(0.46%) African-American and 79 (1.25%) Hispanic students.\n      Now assume that the University’s use of race is truly holistic; that given\nthe multitude of other race-neutral variables the University considers and\nvalues sincerely, race’s significance is limited in any individual application\npacket. See Fisher, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">645</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Lastly,\nassume that in this system, the University’s use of race results in a but-for offer\nof admission in one-quarter of the decisions. A twenty-five percent but-for\nadmissions rate seems highly improbable if race is truly limited in its holistic\nweighting, but the unlikelihood of the assumption proves my point. Even under\nsuch a system, the University’s proper use of race holistically would only yield\n15 (0.24%) African-American and 40 (0.62%) Hispanic students.             African-\nAmerican students, for example, admitted and enrolled by way of this holistic\nsystem would still only constitute two-tenths of one percent of the University of\nTexas’s 2008 entering freshman class.        Such a use of race could have no\ndiscernable impact on the classroom-level “educational benefits diversity is\ndesigned to produce” or otherwise influence “critical mass” at the University of\nTexas generally. Such a plan exacts a cost disproportionate to its benefit and is\nnot narrowly tailored. This is especially so on a university campus with, for\nexample, 4,448 classes (out of 5,631) with zero or one African-American students,\nand 1,689 classes with zero or one Hispanic students.

If the University’s use of race is truly\nnecessary to accomplish its educational function, then as a factual matter, the\nUniversity of Texas’s race-conscious measures have been completely ineffectual\nin accomplishing its claimed compelling interest.\n      In contrast, Top Ten Percent was responsible for contributing 305 and\n1,164 African-American and Hispanic students, respectively, to the entering\n2008 freshman class using entirely race-neutral means.             These students\nrepresent 4.8% and 18.4% of the entering in-state freshman class. In addition,\nof the 58 African-American and 158 Hispanic enrolled students evaluated on the\nbasis of their AI and PAI scores, if the University’s use of race was truly holistic,\nthe percentage of these students for whom race was a decisive factor (i.e., but-for\nadmits) should be minimal. In other words, the vast majority of these 58 and\n158 students were admitted based on objective factors other than race. That is,\nthe University was able to obtain approximately 96% of the African-American\nand Hispanic students enrolled in the 2008 entering in-state freshman class\nusing race-neutral means. And although the University argues that this number\nstill does not qualify as critical mass, one thing is certain: the University of\nTexas’s use of race has had an infinitesimal impact on critical mass in the\nstudent body as a whole. As such, the University’s use of race can be neither\ncompelling nor narrowly tailored.\n\n\n\n\n                                         81\n\f     Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 82 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-50822\n\n       I do not envy the admissions officials at the University of Texas. In 1997,\nin response to our decision in Hopwood v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714814\"><a href=\"/opinion/714814/cheryl-j-hopwood-v-state-of-texas-v-thurgood-marshall-legal-society-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1996), the\npeople of the State of Texas determined, through their elected representatives,\nthat something needed to be done to improve minority enrollment at Texas’s\npublic institutions of higher education.              Texas’s Top Ten Percent law was\nintended to effectuate that desire.                 We take no position today on the\nconstitutionality of that law.21 Instead, we are asked to scrutinize the legality of\nthe University’s race-conscious policy designed to complement Top Ten Percent.\nEven with the limited data available, I cannot find that the University of Texas’s\nuse of race is narrowly tailored where the University’s highly suspect use of race\nprovides no discernable educational impact.                In my view, the University’s\nprogram fails strict scrutiny before or after Grutter. See, e.g., Parents Involved\nin Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145702\"><a href=\"/opinion/145702/parents-involved-in-community-schools-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 790 (2007) (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring) (“[I]ndividual racial classifications employed in this manner may be\nconsidered legitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compelling\ninterest.”) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). Before Grutter, it is unlikely that\nthe Supreme Court would have found that the University of Texas’s means were\nnarrowly tailored to the interest it asserts. Nonetheless, narrow tailoring in the\nuniversity admissions context is not about balancing constitutional costs and\nbenefits any longer. Post-Grutter, universities need not inflict the least harm\npossible so long as they operate in good faith. And in assessing good faith,\ninstitutions like the University of Texas need not even provide the type of\n\n       21\n          In assessing whether the University’s use of race is narrowly tailored, today’s\nmajority opinion finds that Top Ten Percent is not a race-neutral alternative that serves the\nUniversity’s asserted interest “about as well” as its Grutter-like plan. See ante at 39–46. My\nconcurrence should not be read to approve or reject the constitutionality of percentage plans\nlike Top Ten Percent. That issue remains open. I write separately to underscore the minimal\neffect that the University’s use of race has had on critical mass in light of Top Ten Percent, and\nwhy the University’s use of race would not, therefore, be narrowly tailored applying traditional\nstrict scrutiny principles before Grutter. I recognize that Grutter appears to swallow this\nconcern.\n\n                                               82\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 83 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-50822\n\nmetrics that allow courts to review their affirmative action programs. As long\nas these public institutions remain sufficiently opaque in their use of race,\nreviewing courts like ours will be hard pressed to find anything short of good\nfaith and narrow tailoring. In the world post-Grutter, courts are enjoined to take\nuniversities at their word.\n                                          III\n      The Supreme Court’s narrow tailoring jurisprudence has been reliably\ntethered, at least before 2003, to the principle that whenever the government\ndivides citizens by race, which is itself an evil that can only be justified in the\nmost compelling circumstances, that the means chosen will inflict the least harm\npossible, see Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.), and fit the compelling\ngoal “so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the\nclassification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.” Croson, 488 U.S.\nat 493; see also Kimel v.

Grutter abandoned\nthis principle and substituted in its place an amorphous, untestable, and above\nall, hopelessly deferential standard that ensures that race-based preferences in\nuniversity admissions will avoid meaningful judicial review for the next several\ndecades.\n      My disagreement with Grutter is more fundamental, however. Grutter’s\nfailing, in my view, is not only that it approved an affirmative action plan\nincapable of strict scrutiny, but more importantly, that it approved the use of\nrace in university admissions as a compelling state interest at all.\n      The idea of dividing people along racial lines is artificial and antiquated.\nHuman beings are not divisible biologically into any set number of races.22 A\n\n      22\n         See Alexander & Schwarzschild, 21 CONST.

Each individual is unique. And yet,\nin 2010, governmental decisionmakers are still fixated on dividing people into\nwhite, black, Hispanic, and other arbitrary subdivisions. The University of\nTexas, for instance, segregates student admissions data along five racial classes.\nSee, e.g., 2008 Top Ten Percent Report at 6 (reporting admissions data for White,\nNative-American, African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic students).\nThat is not how society looks any more, if it ever did.\n       When government divides citizens by race, matters are different.23\nGovernment-sponsored discrimination is repugnant to the notion of human\nequality and is more than the Constitution can bear. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at\n388 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (“Preferment by race, when resorted to by the\nState, can be the most divisive of all policies, containing within it the potential\nto destroy confidence in the Constitution and the idea of equality.”). There are\nno de minimis violations of the Equal Protection Clause, and when government\nundertakes any level of race-based social engineering, the costs are enormous.\nNot only are race-based policies inherently divisive, they reinforce stereotypes\nthat groups of people, because of their race, gender, or ethnicity, think alike or\nhave common life experiences.

If anything, government-sponsored\ndiscrimination in this context presents an even greater threat of long-term\nharm.24\n       For the most part, college admissions is a zero-sum game.

STERBA, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION & RACIAL PREFERENCE 109 (2003).\n      25\n          For example, in the School of Architecture, the School of Fine Arts, and certain\nhonors programs, where aptitude is essential, the University requires special portfolio,\naudition, and other requirements. See ante at 23 n.87. In these and other impacted programs\n\n                                              85\n\f    Case: 09-50822 Document: 00511354149 Page: 86 Date Filed: 01/18/2011\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-50822\n\nto say that the college application is 18 years in the making and is an unusually\npersonal experience: the application presents a student’s best self in the hopes\nthat her sustained hard work and experience to date will be rewarded with\nadmission. Race-based preferences break faith with this expectation by favoring\na handful of students based on a trait beyond the control of all. See Bakke, 438\nU.S. at 361 (opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall & Blackmun, JJ.)\n(“[A]dvancement sanctioned, sponsored, or approved by the State should ideally\nbe based on individual merit or achievement, or at least on factors within the\ncontrol of the individual . . . .”). Given the highly personal nature of the college\nadmissions process, this kind of class-based discrimination poses an especially\nacute threat of resentment and its corollary—entitlement. More fundamentally,\nit “assures that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the\nultimate goal of eliminating entirely from governmental decisionmaking such\nirrelevant factors as a human being’s race will never be achieved.” Croson, 488\nU.S. at 495 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n       Yesterday’s racial discrimination was based on racial preference; today’s\nracial preference results in racial discrimination. Changing the color of the\ngroup discriminated against simply inverts, but does address, the fundamental\nproblem: the Constitution prohibits all forms of government-sponsored racial\ndiscrimination. Grutter puts the Supreme Court’s imprimatur on such ruinous\nbehavior and ensures that race will continue to be a divisive facet of American\nlife for at least the next two generations. Like the plaintiffs and countless other\ncollege applicants denied admission based, in part, on government-sponsored\nracial discrimination, I await the Court’s return to constitutional first principles.\n\n\n\n\nwhere student demand outstrips available space, the University recognizes and uses merit as\nthe decisive consideration in admission. I do not see why excellence and merit warrant less\nconsideration in the University’s other disciplines.\n\n                                            86\n\f</pre>",
