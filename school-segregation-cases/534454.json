In her Second Amended Complaint\n(“SAC”), Tamika Covington, who has been a basketball\nofficial in New Jersey and Pennsylvania for over ten\nyears, alleges gender employment1 discrimination under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e, et seq., Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., and the New Jersey Law\nAgainst Discrimination, N.J. STAT. ANN. § 10:5-1, et seq.\n(“NJLAD”), because she has been excluded from\n\n1\n Title VII and Title IX prohibit discrimination based on sex.\nThe District Court used “gender” and “sex” interchangeably,\nas do we.\n\n\n\n\n                              4\n\fofficiating at boys‟ high school varsity basketball games.\nWithout hearing argument on the merits of Covington‟s\ncentral claim, the District Court dismissed the complaint\nwith prejudice against all defendants and ordered the case\nclosed. Covington appealed.\n\n\n                             I.\n\n       Covington brings her suit against various entities\nthat have some role in high school athletics in New\nJersey. She names as defendants the International\nAssociation of Approved Basketball Officials, Board 193\n(“Board 193”), the principal defendant, which assigns\nofficials to officiate at regular season high school\nbasketball games; the New Jersey State Interscholastic\nAthletic Association (“NJSIAA”), the entity that controls\nand supervises post-season tournament games and\nassigns officials to referee those games; the International\nAssociation of Approved Basketball Officials\n(“IAABO”), the Colonial Valley Conference (“CVC”),\nthe Hamilton Township School District (“Hamilton”), a\nschool at which Covington has officiated, and Fred\nDumont, the President of Board 193.2 Covington\nalleges that Hamilton, CVC, and NJSIAA are liable\nunder Title VII as her employers; Board 193 is liable as\nan employment agency; NJSIAA and IAABO are\n\n\n2\n Covington does not assert any federal claims against\nDumont.\n\n\n\n\n                             5\n\fvicariously liable as Board 193‟s principals; and CVC is\nvicariously liable as Hamilton‟s principal.\n\n       The essence of Covington‟s claim is that Board\n193 has not assigned her to officiate at boys‟ regular\nseason games because of its policy discriminating against\nwomen, that NJSIAA has not assigned her to officiate at\nboys‟ post-season games for the same reason, and that\nthe other defendants have assisted in that policy.3 Despite\nthe absence or scarcity of women referees assigned to\nboys‟ varsity games, none of the defendants has\nconceded that it employed a policy to exclude females\nfrom a position officiating in boys‟ basketball\ntournaments and there is no document that so provides.4\nIn the absence of any written policy, Covington alleges a\npattern and practice of discrimination. The District Court\ndid not address Covington‟s allegations of discrimination\non the merits, instead dismissing on other grounds.\n\n\n3\n  The issue of whether Covington was not assigned to boys‟\ngames due to her qualifications or for an illegitimate\ndiscriminatory reason is not before us today. However, we\nnote that in oral argument, counsel for NJSIAA stated that\nNJSIAA has never assigned female referees, including\nCovington, to boys‟ post-season games. Furthermore,\ncounsel for Covington stated that Covington was only\nassigned to boys‟ regular season varsity games after this\nlawsuit was brought.\n4\n  It is unlikely that any female will believe that there wasn‟t a\ntrace of discrimination if only males were uniformly selected\nto referee the most desirable games.\n\n\n\n\n                                6\n\f        The District Court granted judgment on the\npleadings on Covington‟s original Complaint, holding\nthat Covington did not adequately plead her employment\nby Board 193 or IAABO as required by Title VII, and\nthat Covington did not allege that Hamilton received\nfederal financial assistance as required to state a Title IX\nclaim. Covington sought to remedy these deficiencies by\nfiling the SAC. It is that document that is before us now.\n\n       The District Court then issued an Order to Show\nCause, asking Covington to explain why the SAC should\nnot be dismissed. Covington filed a reply, and the parties\nhad extensive discovery. The Court dismissed the SAC\nwithout oral argument, holding that Covington had not\nadequately alleged facts sufficient to establish an\nemployer-employee or other relationship necessary to\nhold defendants liable under Title VII. The Court also\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\nstate law claims.\n\n       The District Court cited Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662 (2009), in support of its dismissal.\nHowever, those cases do not provide a panacea for\ndefendants. Instead, they merely require that plaintiff\nraise a “plausible claim for relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679. Although it is established that under the Twombly\nand Iqbal pleading standards, “[f]actual allegations must\nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative\nlevel,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, those cases make it\nclear that a claimant does not have to “set out in detail\n\n\n\n\n                             7\n\fthe facts upon which he bases his claim.” Id. at 555 n.3\n(quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957))\n(emphasis omitted). The pleading standard “is not akin\nto a „probability requirement‟” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); to survive a motion\nto dismiss, a complaint merely has to state a “plausible\nclaim for relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.\n\n       It appears that counsel who filed the original\ncomplaint relied for the plausibility of its claim of gender\ndiscrimination on the success of a similar claim in\nKemether v. Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic\nAssociation Inc., 15 F. Supp. 2d 740 (E.D. Pa. 1998). In\nthat case, the district court upheld a jury verdict for an\nexcluded female official who officiated Pennsylvania\nhigh school basketball games. In dismissing Covington‟s\noriginal complaint, the District Court did not conceal its\ndisrespect for the Kemether opinion. We believe that\nopinion was entitled to more serious regard than it was\ngiven by the District Court in light of the similarity of the\nstructure of the sport in the two states, the plaintiffs‟\nclaims, and the jury verdict for Kemether in the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n\n                             II.\n\n       Covington, like Kemether, alleges violation of\nTitle VII and Title IX. The District Court had\njurisdiction over the Title VII and Title IX claims\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and jurisdiction over the\nstate law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. We have\n\n\n\n\n                              8\n\fjurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1291. This court reviews de novo a district court‟s\ndismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. See\nGraves v. Lowery, 117 F.3d 723, 726 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       Title VII states, in part, that it is an “unlawful\nemployment practice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual . . . because of such\nindividual‟s . . . sex . . . or (2) to limit, segregate, or\nclassify his employees or applicants for employment in\nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities . . . because of\nsuch individual‟s . . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)\n(emphasis added).\n\n       Congress enacted Title VII “for the ameliorative\npurpose of eradicating prohibited forms of discrimination\nfrom the workplace.” Martin v. United Way of Erie\nCnty., 829 F.2d 445, 449 (3d Cir. 1987). The intent of\nthe statute is to “drive employers to focus on\nqualifications rather than on race, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.” Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S.\n228, 243 (1989). Instead of meeting Covington‟s\ndiscrimination allegations, the defendants argue they are\nnot covered by the provisions of the antidiscrimination\nstatutes because they are not encompassed within the\ndefinitions of the relevant statutes; in other words, they\nare free to discriminate. Presumably, they would be as\nfree to discriminate on the basis of race as well as sex.\nThere is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to\n\n\n\n\n                             9\n\fexclude school sports officials from the ameliorative\nprovisions of Titles VII and IX, which is what the\nDistrict Court‟s narrow reading of the relevant statutory\nlanguage would accomplish.\n\n       In order to state a Title VII claim, Covington must\nallege an employment relationship with the defendants.\nTo determine whether Covington is an employee, we\nlook to the factors set forth in Nationwide Mutual\nInsurance Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318 (1992). We\nagree with the District Court when it reads our case law\nto focus the employment relationship analysis on “the\nlevel of control the defendant[s]. . . exerted over the\nplaintiff: which entity paid [the employees‟] salaries,\nhired and fired them, and had control over their daily\nemployment activities.” Covington v. Int’l Ass’n of\nApproved Basketball Officials, No. 08-3639, 2010 WL\n3404977, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 26, 2010). Because\nHamilton has some input as to which officials are\nassigned to each game, chooses the time, date, and\nlocation of the games, and pays the officials for their\nwork during the basketball games, with payment for\nwork generally understood as one of the principal indicia\nof an employer-employee relationship, we hold that\nHamilton may fairly be identified as Covington‟s\nemployer.5\n\n5\n At this stage of the litigation, we must accept as true all\nfactual allegations in the SAC and all reasonable inferences\nthat can be drawn therefrom. See Graves, 117 F.3d at 726.\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\f       Another defendant Covington lists as an employer,\nNJSIAA, is an athletic organization made up of high\nschools in New Jersey. It controls the post-season\ntournaments, directly assigns officials to post-season\ngames, and pays the referees for their work in the post-\nseason. Officials who are chosen for post-season games\nmust be dues-paying members of NJSIAA, enter into\nagreements with NJSIAA, and sign liability waivers.\nNJSIAA provides the officials with liability insurance.\nNJSIAA plays a role in training the officials and has the\npower to certify and register them. Officials are required\nto abide by NJSIAA rules and regulations while\nofficiating. Officials wear a uniform prescribed by\nNJSIAA, which identifies them as NJSIAA officials. It\nfollows from the foregoing that at this preliminary stage,\nwe accept Covington‟s claim that NJSIAA is liable as an\nemployer for post-season games.\n\n       Our examination of Covington‟s allegations\nrelated to CVC shows no similar relationship. CVC does\nnot pay officials and does not contribute to their training\nor evaluation. Therefore, we reject Covington‟s\nallegation that CVC is liable as her employer under Title\nVII.\n\n      Looking to the final principal defendant, Board\n193, Covington argues that it fits within the definition of\nan employment agency. An “employment agency” is\ndefined under Title VII as “any person regularly\nundertaking with or without compensation to procure\n\n\n\n\n                            11\n\femployees for an employer or to procure for employees\nopportunities to work for an employer and includes an\nagent of such a person.” §2000e(c). Board 193 does not\ndeny that it comes within the Title VII definition of\nemployment agency. However, it states that it cannot be\nliable because to be liable as an employment agency,\nthere has to be an employment relationship between\nCovington and Hamilton. As stated above, Covington\nhas adequately pled an employment relationship with\nHamilton. Therefore, Board 193 is liable as an\nemployment agency. In summary, Covington has\nplausibly alleged an employment relationship with\nHamilton for regular season games, with NJSIAA for\npost-season games, and with Board 193 as an\nemployment agency.\n\n        Covington asserts that NJSIAA, IAABO, and CVC\nare vicariously liable for the asserted Title VII violations.\n“„An agency relationship is created when one party\nconsents to have another act on its behalf, with the\nprincipal controlling and directing the acts of the agent.‟”\nAT& T Co. v. Winback & Conserve Program, Inc., 42\nF.3d 1421, 1434 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting Sears Mortg.\nCorp. v. Rose, 634 A.2d 74, 79 (N.J. 1993)). Vicarious\nliability due to an agency relationship can be based on\nthe agent‟s actual authority. “An agent acts with actual\nauthority when, at the time of taking action that has legal\nconsequences for the principal, the agent reasonably\nbelieves, in accordance with the principal‟s\nmanifestations to the agent, that the principal wishes the\nagent so to act.” Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.01\n\n\n\n\n                             12\n\f(2006). Vicarious liability can also be based on apparent\nauthority. “„Apparent authority arises in those situations\nwhere the principal causes persons with whom the agent\ndeals to reasonably believe that the agent has authority‟\ndespite the absence of an actual agency relationship.”\nWinback, 42 F.3d at 1439 (quoting Barticheck v. Fidelity\nUnion Bank/First Nat’l State, 680 F. Supp. 144, 148-49\n(D.N.J. 1988)).\n\n       Board 193 is a chapter of NJSIAA. NJSIAA\nprovides training and evaluation requirements for Board\n193 officials, and requires them to attend certain\nmeetings, at which NJSIAA rules are reviewed.\nCovington has shown that NJSIAA has some control,\nparticularly in training and evaluation, of the basketball\nofficials. However, we see nothing to support\nCovington‟s allegation that NJSIAA is vicariously liable\nfor Board 193‟s actions.\n\n       Covington also alleges that IAABO is a principal\nof Board 193. IAABO, which is a worldwide\norganization, provides curricula and training materials for\nbasketball officials. IAABO retains some authority to\ndiscipline Board 193 members. We gave Covington the\nopportunity to explain IAABO‟s connection with this\naction but, from the information provided, it appears that\nit has no connection with the assignment of officials to\ngames. IAABO does not have sufficient control over\nBoard 193 so as to be its principal. We therefore have no\nbasis to hold IAABO liable.\n\n\n\n\n                            13\n\f       Finally, Covington states there is an agency\nrelationship between CVC and Hamilton. However, she\ndoes not adequately allege that CVC has control over\nHamilton so as to be vicariously liable.6\n\n                            III.\n\n       For the reasons set forth, we will remand this\nmatter to the District Court to give Covington an\nopportunity to provide more facts as to her claim against\nHamilton, Board 193, and NJSIAA. We will affirm the\nDistrict Court‟s dismissal of Covington‟s claim against\nthe CVC and IAABO.\n\n\n\n\n6\n Although Covington supplemented her allegations with\nrespect to Title IX alleging Hamilton‟s receipt of federal\nfunds, her Title IX claim is inadequate because she does not\nallege an official policy of discrimination at Hamilton and\ndoes not allege that an individual with authority to address the\ndiscrimination had actual knowledge of the discrimination.\nSee Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290\n(1998).\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\f",

In her Second Amended Complaint\n(“SAC”), Tamika Covington, who has been a basketball\nofficial in New Jersey and Pennsylvania for over ten\nyears, alleges gender employment1 discrimination under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n2000e, et seq., Title IX of the Education Amendments of\n1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, et seq., and the New Jersey Law\nAgainst Discrimination, N.J. STAT. ANN. § 10:5-1, et seq.\n(“NJLAD”), because she has been excluded from\n\n1\n Title VII and Title IX prohibit discrimination based on sex.\nThe District Court used “gender” and “sex” interchangeably,\nas do we.\n\n\n\n\n                              4\n\fofficiating at boys‟ high school varsity basketball games.\nWithout hearing argument on the merits of Covington‟s\ncentral claim, the District Court dismissed the complaint\nwith prejudice against all defendants and ordered the case\nclosed. Covington appealed.\n\n\n                             I.\n\n       Covington brings her suit against various entities\nthat have some role in high school athletics in New\nJersey. She names as defendants the International\nAssociation of Approved Basketball Officials, Board 193\n(“Board 193”), the principal defendant, which assigns\nofficials to officiate at regular season high school\nbasketball games; the New Jersey State Interscholastic\nAthletic Association (“NJSIAA”), the entity that controls\nand supervises post-season tournament games and\nassigns officials to referee those games; the International\nAssociation of Approved Basketball Officials\n(“IAABO”), the Colonial Valley Conference (“CVC”),\nthe Hamilton Township School District (“Hamilton”), a\nschool at which Covington has officiated, and Fred\nDumont, the President of Board 193.2 Covington\nalleges that Hamilton, CVC, and NJSIAA are liable\nunder Title VII as her employers; Board 193 is liable as\nan employment agency; NJSIAA and IAABO are\n\n\n2\n Covington does not assert any federal claims against\nDumont.\n\n\n\n\n                             5\n\fvicariously liable as Board 193‟s principals; and CVC is\nvicariously liable as Hamilton‟s principal.\n\n       The essence of Covington‟s claim is that Board\n193 has not assigned her to officiate at boys‟ regular\nseason games because of its policy discriminating against\nwomen, that NJSIAA has not assigned her to officiate at\nboys‟ post-season games for the same reason, and that\nthe other defendants have assisted in that policy.3 Despite\nthe absence or scarcity of women referees assigned to\nboys‟ varsity games, none of the defendants has\nconceded that it employed a policy to exclude females\nfrom a position officiating in boys‟ basketball\ntournaments and there is no document that so provides.4\nIn the absence of any written policy, Covington alleges a\npattern and practice of discrimination. The District Court\ndid not address Covington‟s allegations of discrimination\non the merits, instead dismissing on other grounds.\n\n\n3\n  The issue of whether Covington was not assigned to boys‟\ngames due to her qualifications or for an illegitimate\ndiscriminatory reason is not before us today. However, we\nnote that in oral argument, counsel for NJSIAA stated that\nNJSIAA has never assigned female referees, including\nCovington, to boys‟ post-season games. Furthermore,\ncounsel for Covington stated that Covington was only\nassigned to boys‟ regular season varsity games after this\nlawsuit was brought.\n4\n  It is unlikely that any female will believe that there wasn‟t a\ntrace of discrimination if only males were uniformly selected\nto referee the most desirable games.\n\n\n\n\n                                6\n\f        The District Court granted judgment on the\npleadings on Covington‟s original Complaint, holding\nthat Covington did not adequately plead her employment\nby Board 193 or IAABO as required by Title VII, and\nthat Covington did not allege that Hamilton received\nfederal financial assistance as required to state a Title IX\nclaim. Covington sought to remedy these deficiencies by\nfiling the SAC. It is that document that is before us now.\n\n       The District Court then issued an Order to Show\nCause, asking Covington to explain why the SAC should\nnot be dismissed. Covington filed a reply, and the parties\nhad extensive discovery. The Court dismissed the SAC\nwithout oral argument, holding that Covington had not\nadequately alleged facts sufficient to establish an\nemployer-employee or other relationship necessary to\nhold defendants liable under Title VII. The Court also\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\nstate law claims.\n\n       The District Court cited Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), and Ashcroft v.

Instead, they merely require that plaintiff\nraise a “plausible claim for relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n679. Although it is established that under the Twombly\nand Iqbal pleading standards, “[f]actual allegations must\nbe enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative\nlevel,” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, those cases make it\nclear that a claimant does not have to “set out in detail\n\n\n\n\n                             7\n\fthe facts upon which he bases his claim.” Id. at 555 n.3\n(quoting Conley v.

The pleading standard “is not akin\nto a „probability requirement‟” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); to survive a motion\nto dismiss, a complaint merely has to state a “plausible\nclaim for relief.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.\n\n       It appears that counsel who filed the original\ncomplaint relied for the plausibility of its claim of gender\ndiscrimination on the success of a similar claim in\nKemether v. Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic\nAssociation Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314749\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314749/kemether-v-pennsylvania-interscholastic-athletic-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Pa. 1998). In\nthat case, the district court upheld a jury verdict for an\nexcluded female official who officiated Pennsylvania\nhigh school basketball games. In dismissing Covington‟s\noriginal complaint, the District Court did not conceal its\ndisrespect for the Kemether opinion. We believe that\nopinion was entitled to more serious regard than it was\ngiven by the District Court in light of the similarity of the\nstructure of the sport in the two states, the plaintiffs‟\nclaims, and the jury verdict for Kemether in the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n\n                             II.\n\n       Covington, like Kemether, alleges violation of\nTitle VII and Title IX. The District Court had\njurisdiction over the Title VII and Title IX claims\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and jurisdiction over the\nstate law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. We have\n\n\n\n\n                              8\n\fjurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1291. This court reviews de novo a district court‟s\ndismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. See\nGraves v. Lowery, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">723</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       Title VII states, in part, that it is an “unlawful\nemployment practice for an employer (1) to fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual . . . because of such\nindividual‟s . . . sex . . . or (2) to limit, segregate, or\nclassify his employees or applicants for employment in\nany way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities . . . because of\nsuch individual‟s . . . sex.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)\n(emphasis added).\n\n       Congress enacted Title VII “for the ameliorative\npurpose of eradicating prohibited forms of discrimination\nfrom the workplace.” Martin v. United Way of Erie\nCnty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494619\"><a href=\"/opinion/494619/margaret-j-martin-v-united-way-of-erie-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 449 (3d Cir. 1987). The intent of\nthe statute is to “drive employers to focus on\nqualifications rather than on race, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.” Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (1989). Instead of meeting Covington‟s\ndiscrimination allegations, the defendants argue they are\nnot covered by the provisions of the antidiscrimination\nstatutes because they are not encompassed within the\ndefinitions of the relevant statutes; in other words, they\nare free to discriminate. Presumably, they would be as\nfree to discriminate on the basis of race as well as sex.\nThere is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to\n\n\n\n\n                             9\n\fexclude school sports officials from the ameliorative\nprovisions of Titles VII and IX, which is what the\nDistrict Court‟s narrow reading of the relevant statutory\nlanguage would accomplish.\n\n       In order to state a Title VII claim, Covington must\nallege an employment relationship with the defendants.\nTo determine whether Covington is an employee, we\nlook to the factors set forth in Nationwide Mutual\nInsurance Co. v. Darden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112710\"><a href=\"/opinion/112710/nationwide-mut-ins-co-v-darden/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992). We\nagree with the District Court when it reads our case law\nto focus the employment relationship analysis on “the\nlevel of control the defendant[s]. . . exerted over the\nplaintiff: which entity paid [the employees‟] salaries,\nhired and fired them, and had control over their daily\nemployment activities.” Covington v. Int’l Ass’n of\nApproved Basketball Officials, No. 08-3639, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">3404977</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 26, 2010). Because\nHamilton has some input as to which officials are\nassigned to each game, chooses the time, date, and\nlocation of the games, and pays the officials for their\nwork during the basketball games, with payment for\nwork generally understood as one of the principal indicia\nof an employer-employee relationship, we hold that\nHamilton may fairly be identified as Covington‟s\nemployer.5\n\n5\n At this stage of the litigation, we must accept as true all\nfactual allegations in the SAC and all reasonable inferences\nthat can be drawn therefrom. See Graves, 117 F.3d at 726.\n\n\n\n\n                              10\n\f       Another defendant Covington lists as an employer,\nNJSIAA, is an athletic organization made up of high\nschools in New Jersey. It controls the post-season\ntournaments, directly assigns officials to post-season\ngames, and pays the referees for their work in the post-\nseason. Officials who are chosen for post-season games\nmust be dues-paying members of NJSIAA, enter into\nagreements with NJSIAA, and sign liability waivers.\nNJSIAA provides the officials with liability insurance.\nNJSIAA plays a role in training the officials and has the\npower to certify and register them. Officials are required\nto abide by NJSIAA rules and regulations while\nofficiating. Officials wear a uniform prescribed by\nNJSIAA, which identifies them as NJSIAA officials. It\nfollows from the foregoing that at this preliminary stage,\nwe accept Covington‟s claim that NJSIAA is liable as an\nemployer for post-season games.\n\n       Our examination of Covington‟s allegations\nrelated to CVC shows no similar relationship. CVC does\nnot pay officials and does not contribute to their training\nor evaluation. Therefore, we reject Covington‟s\nallegation that CVC is liable as her employer under Title\nVII.\n\n      Looking to the final principal defendant, Board\n193, Covington argues that it fits within the definition of\nan employment agency. An “employment agency” is\ndefined under Title VII as “any person regularly\nundertaking with or without compensation to procure\n\n\n\n\n                            11\n\femployees for an employer or to procure for employees\nopportunities to work for an employer and includes an\nagent of such a person.” §2000e(c). Board 193 does not\ndeny that it comes within the Title VII definition of\nemployment agency. However, it states that it cannot be\nliable because to be liable as an employment agency,\nthere has to be an employment relationship between\nCovington and Hamilton. As stated above, Covington\nhas adequately pled an employment relationship with\nHamilton. Therefore, Board 193 is liable as an\nemployment agency. In summary, Covington has\nplausibly alleged an employment relationship with\nHamilton for regular season games, with NJSIAA for\npost-season games, and with Board 193 as an\nemployment agency.\n\n        Covington asserts that NJSIAA, IAABO, and CVC\nare vicariously liable for the asserted Title VII violations.\n“„An agency relationship is created when one party\nconsents to have another act on its behalf, with the\nprincipal controlling and directing the acts of the agent.‟”\nAT& T Co. v. Winback & Conserve Program, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"685119\"><a href=\"/opinion/685119/american-telephone-and-telegraph-company-v-winback-and-conserve-program/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1434 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting Sears Mortg.\nCorp. v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2308801\"><a href=\"/opinion/2308801/sears-mortg-corp-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (N.J. 1993)). Vicarious\nliability due to an agency relationship can be based on\nthe agent‟s actual authority. “An agent acts with actual\nauthority when, at the time of taking action that has legal\nconsequences for the principal, the agent reasonably\nbelieves, in accordance with the principal‟s\nmanifestations to the agent, that the principal wishes the\nagent so to act.” Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.01\n\n\n\n\n                             12\n\f(2006). Vicarious liability can also be based on apparent\nauthority. “„Apparent authority arises in those situations\nwhere the principal causes persons with whom the agent\ndeals to reasonably believe that the agent has authority‟\ndespite the absence of an actual agency relationship.”\nWinback, 42 F.3d at 1439 (quoting Barticheck v. Fidelity\nUnion Bank/First Nat’l State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526660\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526660/barticheck-v-fidelity-union-bankfirst-nat-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148-49\n(D.N.J. 1988)).\n\n       Board 193 is a chapter of NJSIAA. NJSIAA\nprovides training and evaluation requirements for Board\n193 officials, and requires them to attend certain\nmeetings, at which NJSIAA rules are reviewed.\nCovington has shown that NJSIAA has some control,\nparticularly in training and evaluation, of the basketball\nofficials. However, we see nothing to support\nCovington‟s allegation that NJSIAA is vicariously liable\nfor Board 193‟s actions.\n\n       Covington also alleges that IAABO is a principal\nof Board 193. IAABO, which is a worldwide\norganization, provides curricula and training materials for\nbasketball officials. IAABO retains some authority to\ndiscipline Board 193 members. We gave Covington the\nopportunity to explain IAABO‟s connection with this\naction but, from the information provided, it appears that\nit has no connection with the assignment of officials to\ngames. IAABO does not have sufficient control over\nBoard 193 so as to be its principal. We therefore have no\nbasis to hold IAABO liable.\n\n\n\n\n                            13\n\f       Finally, Covington states there is an agency\nrelationship between CVC and Hamilton. However, she\ndoes not adequately allege that CVC has control over\nHamilton so as to be vicariously liable.6\n\n                            III.\n\n       For the reasons set forth, we will remand this\nmatter to the District Court to give Covington an\nopportunity to provide more facts as to her claim against\nHamilton, Board 193, and NJSIAA. We will affirm the\nDistrict Court‟s dismissal of Covington‟s claim against\nthe CVC and IAABO.\n\n\n\n\n6\n Although Covington supplemented her allegations with\nrespect to Title IX alleging Hamilton‟s receipt of federal\nfunds, her Title IX claim is inadequate because she does not\nallege an official policy of discrimination at Hamilton and\ndoes not allege that an individual with authority to address the\ndiscrimination had actual knowledge of the discrimination.\nSee Gebser v.
