Appellees G.J.P. and A.P. (“Parents”)\n\nmarried in 2006 and had three children, all of whom are still minors. Parents separated\n\nin October 2012, albeit they did not initiate divorce proceedings. Because they were in\n\nagreement as to custody matters while living separately, Parents never sought court\n\ninvolvement and no custody order was issued prior to this litigation. In December 2012,\n\nParents mutually agreed that all contact between the children and their paternal\n\ngrandparents, appellants D.P. and B.P. (“Grandparents”), should be discontinued.\n\f      In October 2014, Grandparents commenced this action by filing a complaint in\n\nthe county court naming Parents as defendants and seeking partial physical custody of\n\nthe minor children.   See 23 Pa.C.S. §5322(a) (defining partial physical custody as\n\nphysical custody for less than a majority of the time). Grandparents did not suggest that\n\nParents were unfit or that the children were in any danger. As their basis for standing\n\nthey relied on Section 5325 of the Domestic Relations Code (the “Code”),1 which states:\n\n      In addition to situations set forth in section 5324 (relating to standing for\n      any form of physical custody or legal custody), grandparents and great-\n      grandparents may file an action under this chapter for partial physical\n      custody or supervised physical custody in the following situations:\n\n      (1) where the parent of the child is deceased, a parent or grandparent of\n      the deceased parent may file an action under this section;\n\n      (2) where the parents of the child have been separated for a period of at\n      least six months or have commenced and continued a proceeding to\n      dissolve their marriage; or\n\n      (3) when the child has, for a period of at least 12 consecutive months,\n      resided with the grandparent or great-grandparent, excluding brief\n      temporary absences of the child from the home, and is removed from the\n      home by the parents, an action must be filed within six months after the\n      removal of the child from the home.\n23 Pa.C.S. §5325 (emphasis added).2\n\n1\n The Domestic Relations Code comprises Title 23 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated\nStatutes. Section 5325 is located in Chapter 53, which governs child custody disputes.\nSee 23 Pa.C.S. §5321. The most recent version of the chapter was enacted in 2010.\nSee Act of Nov. 23, 2010, P.L. 1106, No. 112, Section 2 (as amended 23 Pa.C.S.\n§§5321-5340). That legislation repealed and replaced the prior version, enacted in\n1985, which had been codified at Sections 5301 through 5315.\n\n2\n  Section 5324, referred to in the initial portion of Section 5325 above, gives\ngrandparents standing to seek custody in various situations not implicated here, such as\nwhere a child has been adjudicated dependent or is at substantial risk of harm from the\nparents. See 23 Pa.C.S. §5324(3).\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 2\n\f       In November 2014, the court issued an interim custody order granting shared\n\nlegal custody to Parents and directing that Grandparents continue to have no contact\n\nwith the children. Thereafter, Parents filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the portion\n\nof paragraph (2) of Section 5325 emphasized above violates their Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights to due process and equal protection. Grandparents submitted a\n\nresponsive pleading observing it was undisputed that Parents had been separated for at\n\nleast six months.\n\n       After briefing and oral argument, the court issued an order granting Parents’\n\nmotion and dismissing the complaint. In an accompanying opinion, the court agreed\n\nwith Parents that Section 5325(2) violates their constitutional rights.         The court\n\nrecognized, initially, that Parents have a fundamental liberty interest in raising their\n\nchildren as they see fit. See D.P. v. G.J.P., No. 1750 of 2014-D, slip op. at 2 (C.P.\n\nWestmoreland Sept. 8, 2015) (quoting Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct.\n\n2054, 2060 (2000) (plurality)).    Accordingly, the court reasoned, because Section\n\n5325(2) substantially burdens that interest, it can only be upheld if it survives strict\n\nscrutiny – meaning, it must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling government\n\ninterest. See id. at 4.\n\n       Applying strict scrutiny, the court specified that the state has a compelling\n\ninterest, exercised through its parens patriae powers, in protecting the welfare of\n\nchildren who are at risk of harm. In the court’s view, however, Section 5325(2) does not\n\nembody a narrowly-tailored means of serving that interest because it improperly\n\nassumes, based solely on the parents’ separated status, that their joint decisions\n\nregarding the raising of their children are infected by a degree of unfitness. See id. at 6\n\n& n.3. By contrast, the court pointed to paragraphs (1) and (3) as reflecting more\n\npersuasive circumstances to allow for grandparent standing. See id. at 5.\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 3\n\f         In terms of precedent, the common pleas court recited that, in Hiller v. Fausey,\n\n588 Pa. 342, 904 A.2d 875 (2006), and Schmehl v. Wegelin, 592 Pa. 581, 927 A.2d 183\n\n(2007), this Court sustained the application of grandparent-standing provisions\n\ncontained in the prior version of Chapter 53. Hiller approved standing in favor of a\n\ngrandparent whose child was deceased, see Hiller, 588 Pa. at 365-66, 904 A.2d at 890\n\n(upholding 23 Pa.C.S. §5311 (repealed)), while Schmehl endorsed standing where the\n\nparents were divorced and also disagreed concerning the grandparents’ partial-custody\n\nrequest. See Schmehl, 592 Pa. at 594, 927 A.2d at 190 (sustaining an application of 23\n\nPa.C.S. §5312 (repealed)). The court distinguished those situations, noting that, here,\n\nParents had jointly decided that their children should have no contact with Grandparents\n\n– and suggesting more generally that when any two parents who are merely separated\n\nare in agreement concerning the individuals with whom their children should or should\n\nnot associate, there is no adequate basis to disturb the ordinary presumption, credited\n\nby the United States Supreme Court, that fit parents act in their children’s best interests.\n\nSee D.P., No. 1750 of 2014-D, slip op. at 9 (quoting Troxel, 530 U.S. at 68, 120 S. Ct. at\n\n2061).\n\n         As to this latter point, the court referred to Herron v. Seizak, 321 Pa. Super. 466,\n\n468 A.2d 803 (1983), and Helsel v. Puricelli, 927 A.2d 252 (Pa. Super. 2007), both of\n\nwhich involved married parents who agreed that grandparents should not be given\n\nvisitation or custody. See D.P., No. 1750 of 2014-D, slip op. at 9-10. Although Herron\n\nand Helsel dealt with intact families, the county court interpreted the opinions as\n\nprimarily establishing that courts should not upset a unified decision of the child’s\n\nparents at the behest of a third party.       See id. at 10.    Circling back to the equal\n\nprotection facet of Parents’ argument, the court ultimately held that, inasmuch as the\n\nlaw presumes married parents living together are able to co-parent their children without\n\n\n                                       [J-53-2016] - 4\n\fjudicial interference, there was no constitutionally sound basis to support a classification\n\nwhereby married parents who are separated should be treated differently. See id. at\n\n10-11.    In this regard, the court indicated that the statute reflects an inappropriate\n\n“implicit presumption of unfitness” attaching to separated parents solely on account of\n\ntheir separated status. Id. at 11.\n\n         On direct appeal to this Court,3 Grandparents acknowledge that Parents have a\n\nfundamental right to direct the care, custody, and control of their children, thus triggering\n\nstrict scrutiny under the Due Process Clause. They agree with the common pleas court\n\nthat the state interest presently implicated, protecting children’s health and emotional\n\nwellbeing, is a compelling one. Grandparents contend, however, that the statute is\n\nnarrowly drawn to advance that interest because it favors relationships specifically with\n\ngrandparents, and only when the parents have been separated for six months.\n\nGrandparents maintain that this materially distinguishes the statute from the one\n\ndeemed constitutionally problematic in Troxel – which allowed standing in favor of any\n\nperson at any time, see WASH. REV. CODE §26.10.160(3) – particularly in view of the\n\nelevated importance extended-family ties have assumed in recent years due to the\n\nbreakdown of the nuclear family.\n\n         Grandparents observe that Hiller pointed to this aspect of the former Section\n\n2311 as being salient in light of the 1985 enactment’s underlying legislative policy to\n\npromote “continuing contact with . . . grandparents when a parent is deceased, divorced\n\n3\n  Grandparents initially appealed to the Superior Court, where the matter was docketed\nat No. 1577 WDA 2015. The intermediate court transferred the appeal to this Court,\nwhich has exclusive appellate jurisdiction of common pleas court decisions holding that\na statute is unconstitutional. See 42 Pa.C.S. §722(7); see also Pa.R.A.P. 751 (relating\nto the transfer of erroneously-filed cases). While the matter was pending in the Superior\nCourt, Parents notified the Attorney General that a statute’s constitutionality had been\ndrawn into question. See Pa.R.A.P. 521(a) (requiring such notice). However, the\nAttorney General has elected not to participate.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 5\n\for separated.” See Brief for Appellants at 11 (citing Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904 A.2d at\n\n886, and quoting 23 Pa.C.S. §5301 (repealed)).4 Grandparents indicate, moreover, that\n\nHiller approved the statutory scheme involved in that dispute because it required that,\n\nbefore grandparent visitation could be ordered, the court take into account whether such\n\nvisitation would interfere with the parent-child relationship, whether a strong bond\n\nbetween the child and grandparent previously existed, and the child’s best interests\n\ngenerally. See id. at 12 (citing Hiller, 588 Pa. at 361, 904 A.2d at 887). Although\n\nGrandparents do not say so expressly, it is implicit in their argument that they believe\n\nthe same analysis and outcome should obtain under the Due Process Clause in relation\n\nto Section 5325.\n\n         As for equal protection, Grandparents rely largely on Schmehl, which rejected an\n\nequal protection challenge to grandparent standing under Section 5312.5 They maintain\n\nthat, because that section contained language which is similar to Section 5325(2), this\n\nCourt should apply the same constitutional principles here as it did in Schmehl. In\n\nterms of the validity of the classification at issue – parents who co-parent while living\n\n4\n Section 5301 was repealed by the 2010 enactment, see supra note 1, and there is no\nexpression of legislative policy in the present version of Chapter 53.\n\n5\n    Section 5312 stated:\n\n         In all proceedings for dissolution, subsequent to the commencement of the\n         proceeding and continuing thereafter or when parents have been\n         separated for six months or more, the court may, upon application of the\n         parent or grandparent of a party, grant reasonable partial custody or\n         visitation rights, or both, to the unmarried child if it finds that visitation\n         rights or partial custody, or both, would be in the best interest of the child\n         and would not interfere with the parent-child relationship. The court shall\n         consider the amount of personal contact between the parents or\n         grandparents of the party and the child prior to the application.\n\n23 Pa.C.S. §5312 (repealed).\n\n\n                                        [J-53-2016] - 6\n\fseparately, versus parents who co-parent and live together – Grandparents point out,\n\ninitially, that Schmehl expounded upon the analytical overlap between due-process and\n\nequal-protection principles in a context involving the protection of children’s health and\n\nemotional welfare, and they again refer to the breakdown of the nuclear family as an\n\nimportant factor justifying the General Assembly’s decision to allow grandparents to\n\npetition for custody when parents have separated. See Brief for Appellants at 13-15.\n\n       Parents’ argument largely tracks the common pleas court’s analysis with regard\n\nto both the due process and equal protection inquiries.            Briefly, they note it is\n\nestablished law that, because their parental rights are fundamental, the Due Process\n\nClause accords those rights heightened protection.6 Parents counter Grandparents’\n\nposition that the statute is narrowly tailored, arguing: (a) there is no factual basis to\n\npresume based solely on a couple’s separation that their children are at greater risk of\n\nharm; and (b) when presumptively fit parents agree that their children should not\n\ndevelop relationships with specific third parties, simply pointing to the “blood\n\nrelationship” of those third parties is insufficient to justify an invocation of the state’s\n\nparens patriae interest. Brief for Appellees at 28.\n\n       Addressing the topic of potential harm to the children, Parents offer that, in pre-\n\nHiller cases where the state exercised its parens patriae authority, the fitness of the\n\nparent was in question due to abuse, neglect, delinquency, or a failure to perform\n\nparental duties. See id. at 29 (citing Ellerbe v. Hooks, 490 Pa. 363, 416 A.2d 512\n\n6\n Parents indicate there is a good reason to consider such rights fundamental, not only\nbecause of the traditional right of parents to “establish a home and bring up children,”\nBrief for Appellees at 15 (quoting Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S. Ct. 625,\n626 (1923)), but because parents fulfill a role which the government cannot. See id. at\n16 (citing Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S. Ct. 438, 442 (1944) (“It is\ncardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents,\nwhose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can\nneither supply nor hinder.”)).\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 7\n\f(1980) (affirming an award of custody to the maternal grandmother over the father’s\n\nobjections where the child was eleven years old and had lived exclusively with the\n\ngrandmother for more than nine years), In re Adoption of J.J., 511 Pa. 590, 515 A.2d\n\n883 (1986) (approving the involuntary termination of parental rights where the father\n\ndemonstrated a fixed inability to perform parental duties), and In re Adoption of C.A.E.,\n\n516 Pa. 419, 532 A.2d 802 (1987) (same where a prematurely-born infant needed\n\nongoing parent-assisted medical intervention, but the mother was unable to provide\n\nsuch care and she had previously deprived the infant of care)).          Differentiating the\n\npresent situation, they argue that separation does not equate to abuse, neglect, or an\n\ninability to perform parental duties. As for Hiller itself, Parents read the holding as\n\nresting on an understanding that the death of a parent would naturally tend to harm a\n\nchild’s wellbeing, and that such harm would be magnified if the child also lost contact\n\nwith a grandparent with whom he or she had a pre-existing beneficial relationship. See\n\nid. at 30 (quoting Hiller, 588 Pa. at 366 n.24, 904 A.2d at 890 n.24).\n\n       Insofar as equal protection is concerned, Parents recognize that Schmehl is the\n\ndecision most closely related to the present scenario and that the Court upheld the\n\nclassification drawn by former Section 5312. Parents do not argue that Schmehl was\n\nwrongly decided or that it should be overruled. They do contend, however, that the\n\ncase is distinguishable because: it did not involve a joint decision by both parents, but\n\nrather, a situation in which a divorced father supported his parents’ request for visitation;\n\nand the parents were already subject to a custody order. By contrast, Parents indicate\n\nthey were never subject to a custody order before Grandparents filed their complaint,\n\nnor do they disagree on matters of custody or visitation. Further, they assert that no\n\nreason has been alleged why they are less capable than non-separated parents of\n\nmaking appropriate decisions about their children’s welfare.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 8\n\f       Parents suggest, as well, that many couples who live together lead dysfunctional\n\nhomes and make poor parenting decisions, all of which evidences the arbitrariness of\n\nSection 5325’s implicit assumption that separated parents are less fit as parents than\n\nthose who live under the same roof. Consequently, Parents propose that the legislative\n\nclassification which rests on that assumption does little to advance the state’s interest in\n\nprotecting children or promoting their welfare. See id. at 35-36. Finally, Parents draw\n\nsupport for their position from a responsive expression in Schmehl in which former Chief\n\nJustice Cappy opined that separation and divorce are not valid proxies for ascertaining\n\nwhich parents might cause harm to their children. See id. at 36-37 (citing Schmehl, 592\n\nPa. at 596-97, 927 A.2d at 192 (Cappy, C.J., dissenting)).\n\n       As reflected in our cases and in Troxel, Grandparent visitation and custody\n\nstatutes authorize state action and, as such, they are subject to constitutional\n\nlimitations. Accord, e.g., In re Herbst, 971 P.2d 395, 398-99 (Okla. 1998) (explaining\n\nthat, “mandating the introduction of a third party, even a grandparent, into a family unit\n\nis state action limiting the parents’ liberty”).7 There is no dispute that Section 5325\n\nburdens the right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and\n\ncontrol of their children; that such right is a fundamental one, see Troxel, 530 U.S. at\n\n65-66, 120 S. Ct. at 2060-61 (discussing cases); Hiller, 588 Pa. at 358, 904 A.2d at 885;\n\n\n7\n  Visitation and custody are distinct concepts. See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 346 n.4, 904 A.2d\nat 878 n.4. Visitation pertains to the right to visit a child but does not include the ability\nto remove the child from the custodial parent’s control. See 23 Pa.C.S. §5302\n(repealed). Physical custody refers to the “physical possession and control of a child.”\n23 Pa.C.S. §5322(a). As noted, partial physical custody is defined as physical custody\nfor less than a majority of the time. See id. Chapter 53 as enacted in 1985 regulated\nvisitation and custody, whereas the 2010 version only governs custody. In our present\ndiscussion, we mention custody and visitation because some of the authority from other\njurisdictions relates to visitation and the constitutional analysis, for present purposes, is\nmaterially identical.\n\n\n                                       [J-53-2016] - 9\n\fand that, as such, it is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s due-process and\n\nequal-protection guarantees. See U.S. CONST. amend. XIV, §1 (forbidding states from\n\ndepriving “any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” or from\n\ndenying to any person within their jurisdiction “the equal protection of the laws”). In light\n\nof these factors there is also no disagreement that, to survive a due process or equal\n\nprotection challenge, Section 5325 must satisfy the constitutional standard known as\n\nstrict scrutiny.\n\n       The basic features of strict scrutiny, relating to whether the governmental action\n\nis narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest, see Hiller, 588 Pa. at 359, 904 A.2d at\n\n885-86, are well established.     As expressed in Schmehl, the inquiries per the Due\n\nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses are distinct but overlapping: pursuant to the\n\nformer, the government’s infringement on fundamental rights must be necessary to\n\nadvance a compelling state interest, whereas under the latter it is the classification\n\ninherent in the statute which must be necessary to achieve that interest. See Schmehl,\n\n592 Pa. at 589, 927 A.2d at 187.8\n\n       Broadly speaking, the state, acting pursuant to its parens patriae power, has a\n\ncompelling interest in safeguarding children from various kinds of physical and\n\nemotional harm and promoting their wellbeing.9 See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 359, 904 A.2d at\n\n8\n  Strict scrutiny is separately triggered under the Equal Protection Clause if the\nlegislation employs a suspect classification. See Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499,\n508, 125 S. Ct. 1141, 1148 (2005). See generally Small v. Horn, 554 Pa. 600, 615\nn.14, 722 A.2d 664, 672 n.14 (1998) (noting that suspect classifications include race,\nnational origin, and, for purposes of state law, alienage). That aspect of equal\nprotection jurisprudence is not presently implicated.\n\n9\n  “Parens patriae, literally ‘parent of the country,’ refers . . . to the role of the state as\nsovereign and guardian of persons under a legal disability to act for themselves such as\njuveniles, the insane, or the unknown.” West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer & Co., 440 F.2d\n1079, 1089 (2d Cir. 1971).\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 10\n\f886 (“The compelling state interest at issue in this case is the state’s longstanding\n\ninterest in protecting the health and emotional welfare of children.”). That aim has been\n\ninvoked to accomplish certain objectives where appropriate, such as involuntarily\n\nterminating a parent’s rights and providing a child with a permanent home. See In re\n\nAdoption of J.J., 511 Pa. at 608, 515 A.2d at 893; see also 23 Pa.C.S. §2511(a)(2), (9)\n\n(permitting involuntary termination of parental rights due to abuse, neglect, or the\n\nconviction of certain crimes).10 The component of the government’s parens patriae\n\nresponsibility implicated here is its interest in ensuring that children are not deprived of\n\nbeneficial relationships with their grandparents.11\n\n       Although this Court’s most relevant precedent consists of Hiller and Schmehl,\n\nneither decision is directly on point. Hiller arose in a situation where the mother had\n\ndied and the maternal grandmother sought to continue an existing relationship with the\n\nminor child. This Court upheld the common pleas court’s application of the statute, 23\n\nPa.C.S. §5311 (repealed), observing that the provision was materially limited in scope\n\nto the deceased-parent scenario and only provided for custody in favor of a grandparent\n\non the deceased parent’s side, see Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904 A.2d at 886, where the\n\nrisk appears greatest that a pre-existing grandparent relationship may be severed.\n\n\n10\n   Aside from issues relating to family relationships, the government’s interest in\nprotecting children and promoting their welfare may also be served via its police power\nas reflected in enactments regulating child labor, requiring school attendance, vaccines,\nand motor-vehicle child safety seats, and imposing criminal liability for corrupting or\notherwise harming minors. Accord Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.\nCt. 438, 442 (1944); Blixt v. Blixt, 774 N.E.2d 1052, 1059 (Ma. 2002); In re Custody of\nSmith, 969 P.2d 21, 28 (Wash. 1998). See generally 18 Pa.C.S. Ch. 63 (defining\noffenses against or involving minors); id. §4304 (defining the offense of endangering the\nwelfare of children).\n\n11\n  The statute also encompasses great-grandparents. For convenience we refer only to\ngrandparents. See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360 n.19, 904 A.2d at 886 n.19.\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 11\n\fGrandparent custody in that context and the considerations it entails are distinct from,\n\nalbeit perhaps overlapping with, the issues that arise when both parents are living.\n\n       Schmehl is closer to the present matter in that it concerned Section 5312, whose\n\nreach was defined by language similar to that which appears in paragraph (2) of Section\n\n5325. Compare 23 Pa.C.S. §5312 (repealed) (allowing for grandparent partial custody\n\nor visitation during “proceedings for dissolution . . . or when parents have been\n\nseparated for six months or more”), with 23 Pa.C.S. §5325(2) (giving grandparents\n\nstanding “where the parents of the child have been separated for a period of at least six\n\nmonths or have commenced and continued a proceeding to dissolve their marriage”).\n\nStill, Schmehl involved divorced parents, see generally Schmehl, 592 Pa. at 593 n.9,\n\n927 A.2d at 189 n.9 (citing scholarship concerning the effects of divorce on children);\n\nsee also id. at 591, 927 A.2d at 188-89 (discussing prior judicial expressions regarding\n\nthe impact of divorce on families), who were not in agreement concerning grandparent\n\ncustody. See id. at 584, 927 A.2d at 184. The breakdown in unified parental decision-\n\nmaking was thus more severe in Schmehl than it is in the present matter, where Parents\n\nhave never sought court involvement in their family issues and are able to co-parent in\n\nagreement concerning whether their children should maintain contact with their\n\ngrandparents.    The objecting parent in Schmehl only sought a declaration that the\n\nstatute was invalid in the divorce setting, and the grandparents defended the statutory\n\nclassification by emphasizing that, unlike with intact families, “[t]he state must oversee a\n\ndivorce action, and arrange for custody, support and visitation in some cases.” Brief for\n\nAppellants in Schmehl v. Wegelin, 592 Pa. 581, 927 A.2d 183 (2007) (No. 87 MAP\n\n2005), 2005 WL 5713971, at *23. Hence, the separation scenario was not before the\n\nCourt in Schmehl, and we cannot assume that any empirical studies relating to the\n\neffects of divorce carry over to mere separation.\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 12\n\f       In spite of these differences, Hiller and Schmehl do inform our inquiry. Hiller\n\nnoted that common pleas courts are required to apply a presumption that parents act in\n\ntheir children’s best interests, and that such presumption applies regardless of whether\n\nthe statute facially necessitates it. See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 361, 904 A.2d at 887 (“In\n\naddition to the language of the statute, our precedent requires our courts to . . . provide\n\na presumption in favor of the decision of a fit parent.”). Thus, the Court observed that,\n\nwhenever a custody dispute arises between the parents and a third party, “the\n\nevidentiary scale is tipped, and tipped hard, to the parents’ side.” Hiller, 588 Pa. at 362,\n\n904 A.2d at 887 (quoting Ellerbe, 490 Pa. at 367, 416 A.2d at 514); see also id. at 363,\n\n904 A.2d at 888 (developing that this Court has repeatedly “reaffirmed the presumption\n\nin favor of parents set forth in Ellerbe”); accord Charles v. Stehlik, 560 Pa. 334, 340,\n\n744 A.2d 1255, 1258 (2000). Hiller also held that this presumption, combined with the\n\n“stringent requirements of Section 5311, as applied in this case,” Hiller, 588 Pa. at 365,\n\n904 A.2d at 890,12 adequately protected parental rights so that grandparents did not\n\nneed to make a threshold showing of actual or potential harm to the child stemming\n\nfrom the surviving parent’s decisions. See id. at 365-66, 904 A.2d at 890.\n\n       By referring to the established presumption in favor of fit parents and Section\n\n5311’s requirements, Hiller rested its holding, in significant part, on considerations\n\nrelating to the preliminary question of standing.13         Most notably, the “stringent\n\n12\n   Section 5311 was similar to Section 5312, see supra note 5, although it referred to a\nsituation where the parent was deceased. See id. at 344 n.1, 904 A.2d at 876 n.1.\n\n13\n   Grandparent standing to seek an order directing custody or visitation is a creature of\nstatute, as grandparents generally lacked substantive rights at common law in relation\nto their grandchildren. Accord Hiller, 588 Pa. at 372, 904 A.2d at 894 (Newman, J.,\nconcurring); Olds v. Olds, 356 N.W.2d 571, 572 (Iowa 1984) (quoting Mimkon v. Ford,\n332 A.2d 199, 200-01 (N.J. 1975)); 2 JOAN M. KRAUSKOPF ET AL., ELDERLAW : ADVOCACY\nFOR THE AGING §25:14 (2d ed. 1993 & Supp. 2015) (collecting cases).\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 13\n\frequirements” of Section 5311 included a prerequisite that the petitioning grandparents\n\ndemonstrate standing to seek relief. That Hiller’s constitutional analysis centered on the\n\npropriety of grandparent standing in the context which arose in that dispute is made\n\nexplicit in its explanation that, “[u]nlike the statute in Troxel, which extended standing to\n\nany person at any time, Section 5311 narrowly limits those who can seek visitation or\n\npartial custody . . . to grandparents whose child has died.” Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904\n\nA.2d at 886; see also Schmehl, 592 Pa. at 588, 927 A.2d at 187 (characterizing Hiller as\n\nholding that Section 5311 was “narrowly tailored . . . because it extend[ed] standing” to\n\na limited, defined subset of grandparents).\n\n       Schmehl’s understanding of the aspect of Section 5312 at issue in that matter\n\nwas similarly couched. See id. at 584-85, 927 A.2d at 184 (summarizing the mother’s\n\nargument that equal protection norms were offended by Section 5312 because\n\n“standing to obtain partial custody or visitation is not afforded to grandparents of\n\nchildren whose parents are married and living together,” while it is afforded to the\n\ngrandparents of children whose parents are divorced or separated).\n\n       The focus on standing is sharpened even further in the present controversy: the\n\ncommon pleas court, unlike in Hiller and Schmehl, never reached the complaint’s merits\n\nbecause it determined that the statutory basis for standing was unconstitutional. In this\n\nrespect, it is notable that the redrafted Chapter 53, more expressly than its predecessor,\n\nsegregates    grandparent     standing   requirements     (Section    5325)    from   merits\n\nconsiderations (Section 5328).14 Therefore, as illustrated presently, whenever there are\n\ncontested issues relating to standing, the chapter gives parents the ability to bifurcate\n\n\n\n14\n  The 1985 version of Chapter 23 also had sections nominally devoted to standing and\nmerits, see 23 Pa.C.S. §§5313 (repealed), 5303 (repealed), but the merits section was\nvery brief and such considerations were intermixed in Sections 5311 and 5312.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 14\n\fthe proceedings by seeking dismissal for lack of standing, thereby requiring that any\n\nsuch preliminary questions be resolved before the complaint’s merits are reached.\n\n       The potential for such bifurcation serves an important screening function in terms\n\nof protecting parental rights. As suggested, it facilitates early dismissal of complaints,\n\nthereby relieving families of the burden of litigating their merits where a sufficient basis\n\nfor standing is absent. Accord Rideout v. Riendeau, 761 A.2d 291, 302-03 (Me. 2000)\n\n(plurality) (indicating that, in a bifurcated procedure, grandparent-standing requirements\n\n“provide[] protection against the expense, stress, and pain of litigation, unless and until\n\nthe grandparents have convinced the court that they are among those grandparents\n\nwho may pursue visits”). Indeed, a majority of Justices in Troxel recognized that such\n\nlitigation can itself impinge upon parental rights, especially if it becomes protracted\n\nthrough the appellate process. See Troxel, 530 U.S. at 75, 120 S. Ct. at 2065; id. at\n\n101, 120 S. Ct. at 2079 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); accord Blixt v. Blixt, 774 N.E.2d 1052,\n\n1065-66 (Ma. 2002).15 Therefore, and as the factors governing resolution of a custody\n\n\n15\n    Hiller also took notice of the costs associated with custodial litigation, indicating that\ngrandchildren are not benefitted when “grandparents force their way into [their] lives\nthrough the courts, contrary to the decision of a fit parent,” and adding that such\nconsideration was “especially resonant given the strain that custody litigation places on\nthe children as well as parents and grandparents[.]” Hiller, 588 Pa. at 359 & n.20, 904\nA.2d at 886 & n.20 (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. at 101, 120 S. Ct. at 2079 (Kennedy, J.,\ndissenting) (describing that custody litigation tends to be disruptive of family life and\nthat, for a parent struggling financially, the monetary costs can undermine the parent’s\nplans for the child’s future)). Other courts have made similar observations. See, e.g.,\nConlogue v. Conlogue, 890 A.2d 691, 699 (Me. 2006) (proffering that the strains of\nlitigation “include various forms of pressures and stress that can pose a real threat to\nfamily well-being” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Hawk v. Hawk, 855\nS.W.2d 573, 577 n.2 (Tenn. 1993) (noting that such stresses include those which arise\nfrom the public disclosure of the details of private, inter-generational disputes); cf. id. at\n576 n.1 (suggesting that court-ordered grandparent visitation in a family where there is\nanimosity between the parents and grandparents can intensify the animosity and, as\nsuch, can be contrary to the child’s best interests).\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 15\n\fcomplaint’s merits (as set forth in Section 5328) are not at issue, our analysis is directed\n\nto whether Section 5325’s conferral of standing to grandparents to prosecute such a\n\ncomplaint can withstand strict scrutiny.\n\n         Again, absent factors such as abuse, neglect, or abandonment, the law\n\npresumes parents are fit and, as such, that their parenting decisions are made in their\n\nchildren’s best interests. See Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 602-03, 99 S. Ct. 2493,\n\n2504 (1979); Troxel, 530 U.S. at 68, 120 S. Ct. at 2061.16 In the context of grandparent-\n\ninitiated litigation, then, the rewritten Chapter 53 can only subsume the essential\n\nscreening function referenced above if the prerequisites to grandparent standing\n\neffectively filter out cases where there is little reason to believe the government may\n\nconstitutionally exercise its parens patriae power by ordering partial custody over the\n\nparents’ objections.\n\n         Consequently, the question becomes whether the state may exercise its interest\n\nin fostering grandparent-grandchild relationships over the objection of presumptively fit\n\nparents solely on the basis that they have been separated for at least six months.\n\n         The stated goal is not insignificant. In the event of a major disruption to the\n\nfamily environment, such as where there is parental abuse, neglect, substance abuse,\n\nmental illness, or abandonment, the interest may be especially pronounced.             See\n\nBennett v. Jeffreys, 356 N.E.2d 277, 281 (N.Y. 1976) (“Examples of cause of necessity\n\npermitting . . . intrusion on parental control would be fault or omission by the parent\n\nseriously affecting the welfare of a child, the preservation of the child’s freedom from\n\nserious physical harm, illness or death, or the child’s right to an education, and the\n\nlike[.]”). Even in less severe circumstances, and in view of the changing nature of the\n\nfamily in the modern era, Hiller suggests other important grounds for believing the state\n\n16\n     The record before us lacks any suggestion tending to rebut the presumption.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 16\n\fhas an elevated interest. See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904 A.2d at 886 (“[I]n the recent\n\npast, grandparents have assumed increased roles in their grandchildren’s lives and our\n\ncumulative experience demonstrates the many potential benefits of strong inter-\n\ngenerational ties.” (citing Troxel, 530 U.S. at 64, 120 S. Ct. at 2059)); see also id. at\n\n347, 904 A.2d at 878-79 (describing the benefits to a minor child, as found by the\n\ncommon pleas court, of continuing a relationship with his maternal grandmother to help\n\nhim cope with his mother’s death); Michael v. Hertzler, 900 P.2d 1144, 1150-51 (Wyo.\n\n1995) (reviewing several ways in which grandparents influence their families (quoting\n\nPatricia S. Fernandez, Grandparent Access: A Model Statute, 6 YALE L. & POL’Y REV.\n\n109, 109-10 (1988))). Nevertheless, where there is no reason to believe presumptively\n\nfit parents are not acting in their children’s best interests, the government’s interest in\n\nallowing a third party to supplant their decisions is diminished. See generally Conlogue,\n\n890 A.2d at 694 (expressing, as a general precept, that “something more than the best\n\ninterest of the child must be at stake in order to establish a compelling state interest”);\n\nTroxel, 530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S. Ct. at 2064 (explaining that, under the Due Process\n\nClause, third-party standing to pursue custody cannot be based solely on the possibility\n\nthat a judge may ultimately disagree with a parent as to what is in the child’s best\n\ninterests).\n\n       Additionally, and crucially for present purposes, we cannot assume that the\n\nrationale supporting the holdings in those cases applies equally to situations involving\n\nparental separation. As this case shows, when parents separate they do not always\n\ninitiate divorce proceedings or otherwise request court involvement in their family\n\naffairs. See generally Brief for Appellees at 35-36 (“Parents are merely separated and\n\nnot subject to a custody order. . . . Parents have the ability to reconcile.”). Although\n\nseparation may involve a disruption of the nuclear family unit, the children are often\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 17\n\fshielded from having to participate in court proceedings and are, likewise, free from\n\nhaving to assimilate the knowledge that the government is now involved in their family\n\nlife. Cf. Frame v. Nehls, 550 N.W.2d 739, 742 (Mich. 1996) (describing the challenged\n\nMichigan statute as setting forth a general rule that grandparents only have standing to\n\nseek visitation if a child custody dispute is already pending). Further, Grandparents and\n\nthe Attorney General – who, as noted, has decided not to participate in this litigation,\n\nsee supra note 3 – have not put before this Court any empirical data corresponding to\n\nthat referenced in Schmehl tending to suggest that separation has the same adverse\n\neffects upon children as divorce.\n\n       As well, unlike in Hiller, separation necessarily implies that both parents are still\n\nalive, which in turn has several consequences. First, there is no void stemming from\n\nthe death of a parent. Second, parental death cannot be the cause of the severance or\n\nnon-existence of a grandparent-grandchild relationship. Finally, when both parents are\n\nliving there is a possibility – as illustrated by this case – that the parents will be in\n\nagreement that their children should not maintain contact with particular third parties.17\n\nThese factors render any court-mandated association with such third parties more\n\nintrusive to the parents’ constitutional prerogatives than in a context where the parents\n\nhave already invoked the court’s oversight as to matters of custody and/or marital\n\ndissolution.   See generally Hawk v. Hawk, 855 S.W.2d 573, 577 (Tenn. 1993)\n\n(“Although courts are commonly called on to resolve custody disputes between parents\n\nand to determine custody when parents are unfit, the trial court’s interference with the\n\n\n\n\n17\n  We recognize that parental agreement of this nature is possible with divorced parents\nand parents who have commenced marriage dissolution proceedings. Whether the\nstanding provisions of Chapter 53 as revised are constitutional in such situations should\nbe developed going forward as cases involving those circumstances arise.\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 18\n\funited decision of admittedly good parents represents a virtually unprecedented\n\nintrusion into a protected sphere of family life.”).\n\n         In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the fact of a parental separation for six\n\nmonths or more does not render the state’s parens patriae interest sufficiently pressing\n\nto justify potentially disturbing the decision of presumptively fit parents concerning the\n\nindividuals with whom their minor children should associate.             It follows that the\n\ninfringement upon parental rights worked by Section 5325 is not narrowly tailored to a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, as the provision could have been drafted to exclude\n\nseparation as an independent basis for grandparent standing. See Danson v. Casey,\n\n484 Pa. 415, 434, 399 A.2d 360, 370 (1979) (explaining that the narrow tailoring\n\nrequirement means the statutory scheme must have been “structured with precision”\n\nand that the Legislature must have chosen the “le[ast] drastic means” of effectuating its\n\nobjectives (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Richard H. Fallon, Jr., Strict\n\nJudicial Scrutiny, 54 UCLA L. REV. 1267, 1328 (2007) (observing that a legislative\n\nenactment can fail the narrow-tailoring component of strict scrutiny if it is\n\n“overinclusive”).    Consequently, Section 5325 cannot survive strict scrutiny and, as\n\nsuch, it violates the fundamental rights of parents safeguarded by the Due Process\n\nClause.18\n\n         Although we have concluded that Section 5325 is not narrowly tailored, it is\n\nevident from our discussion that this determination rests solely on the conferral of\n\nstanding under paragraph (2), the only aspect of Section 5325 that has been brought\n\ninto question in this action. Moreover, paragraph (2) is itself divided into two parts and\n\nphrased in the disjunctive, as it provides for grandparent standing “where the parents of\n\nthe child have been separated for a period of at least six months or have commenced\n\n18\n     In view of our disposition, we need not reach the Equal Protection claim.\n\n\n                                       [J-53-2016] - 19\n\fand continued a proceeding to dissolve their marriage[.]”             23 Pa.C.S. §5325(2)\n\n(emphasis added).       It is noteworthy that these are separate and independent\n\npreconditions for grandparent standing, since it is possible for parents who have not\n\nbeen separated for at least six months to commence and continue a dissolution\n\nproceeding. Thus, the difficulties apparent in the first half of paragraph (2) do not imply\n\nthat the second half – or, for that matter, paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) – is also\n\nproblematic.\n\n       The above informs our decision concerning the appropriate remedy, and in\n\nparticular, the question of severance. In Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New\n\nEngland, 546 U.S. 320, 126 S. Ct. 961 (2006), the Supreme Court explained that “when\n\nconfronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem.”\n\nId. at 328, 126 S. Ct. at 967. The Court continued that “a statute may be declared\n\ninvalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact.” Id. at 329, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 968 (ellipsis, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).       In salvaging a\n\nstatute to the extent possible without judicially rewriting it, Ayotte observed that the\n\n“touchstone” for the remedy is legislative intent, that is, asking whether the “legislature\n\n[would] have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all[.]” Id. at 330, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 968 (citing, inter alia, United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 227, 125 S. Ct. 738,\n\n746 (2005)).\n\n       This comports with our own practice. Although there is no express severability\n\nprovision contained in Act 112 of 2010 or any aspect of the Domestic Relations Code\n\napplicable to Chapter 53, the Statutory Construction Act directs, as general policy, that\n\nall statutory provisions are presumed to be severable, and that if any provision is held to\n\nbe invalid the remainder of the statute which contains it\n\n       shall not be affected thereby, unless the court finds that the valid\n       provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 20\n\f       with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot\n       be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining\n       valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the\n       remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are\n       incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\n1 Pa.C.S. §1925. Thus, severance is appropriate where the remaining provisions are\n\ncapable of execution in accordance with legislative intent. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\n\nMockaitis, 575 Pa. 5, 29-30, 834 A.2d 488, 502-03 (2003).\n\n       As noted, paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 5325, as well as the second half of\n\nparagraph (2), set out separate and distinct bases for grandparent standing that do not\n\ndepend on the first half of paragraph (2), that is, on the parents having been separated\n\nfor at least six months. Since these are not “essentially and inseparably connected\n\nwith” the separation provision, they are capable of execution and may continue in force\n\nabsent the first half of paragraph (2). Such provisions, moreover, are neither implicated\n\nby the underlying facts nor challenged by the parties.\n\n       As concerns the second half of paragraph (2) in particular, invalidating it per the\n\nsuggestion forwarded by Justices Baer and Wecht would require reaching beyond the\n\nbounds of this dispute and declaring Section 5325 unconstitutional more broadly than is\n\nnecessary to resolve the appeal. It would be premature – and thus improper – to make\n\na wide-reaching constitutional declaration along these lines in the present context in\n\nwhich no challenge to the standing requirements relative to divorced parents has been\n\nraised or briefed. We thus differ with any suggestion that we are somehow “avoiding”\n\nthis issue. Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, slip op. at 4 n.2 (Baer, J.).\n\n       More generally, it should be recalled that our “adjudicatory process is structured\n\nto cast a narrow focus on matters framed by litigants before the Court in a highly\n\ndirected fashion,” Sernovitz v. Dershaw, ___ Pa. ___, ___ n.13, 127 A.3d 783, 794 n.13\n\n(2015) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and, as such, we sit “to decide\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 21\n\fconcrete cases.” Id. (quoting Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 386, 101 S.\n\nCt. 677, 681 (1981)). As a result, and as already suggested, see supra note 17, any\n\nsuch judgment should be left for a future controversy in which the issue is squarely\n\npresented, the Court has the benefit of focused adversarial briefing, and the Attorney\n\nGeneral is apprised that the constitutional validity of the second half of Section 5325(2)\n\nhas been called into question and is given an opportunity to defend it. See City of Phila.\n\nv. Commonwealth, 575 Pa. 542, 570, 838 A.2d 566, 583 (2003) (explaining that the\n\nAttorney General is charged with defending the constitutionality of all statutes passed by\n\nthe General Assembly (citing 71 P.S. §732-204(a)(3))). Finally, although Justice Wecht\n\nmay disagree with the holding reached in Schmehl, it remains binding precedent and\n\nthe parties’ briefs lack any request that it be overruled.\n\n       Accordingly, we now sever the first half of paragraph (2) from the remainder of\n\nparagraph (2) and the remainder of Section 5325 generally.19\n\n       The order of the Court of Common Pleas dismissing Grandparents’ complaint is\n\naffirmed.\n\n       Justices Todd, Donohue and Dougherty join the opinion.\n\n       Justice Baer files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\n\n       Justice Wecht files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n\n19\n  To be precise, the text, “have been separated for a period of at least six months or” is\ninoperative and paragraph (2), 23 Pa.C.S. §5325(2), as a consequence of severance,\nnow only provides for standing “where the parents of the child have commenced and\ncontinued a proceeding to dissolve their marriage[.]”\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 22\n\f",

Appellees G.J.P. and A.P. (“Parents”)\n\nmarried in 2006 and had three children, all of whom are still minors. Parents separated\n\nin October 2012, albeit they did not initiate divorce proceedings. Because they were in\n\nagreement as to custody matters while living separately, Parents never sought court\n\ninvolvement and no custody order was issued prior to this litigation. In December 2012,\n\nParents mutually agreed that all contact between the children and their paternal\n\ngrandparents, appellants D.P. and B.P. (“Grandparents”), should be discontinued.\n\f      In October 2014, Grandparents commenced this action by filing a complaint in\n\nthe county court naming Parents as defendants and seeking partial physical custody of\n\nthe minor children.   See 23 Pa.C.S. §5322(a) (defining partial physical custody as\n\nphysical custody for less than a majority of the time). Grandparents did not suggest that\n\nParents were unfit or that the children were in any danger. As their basis for standing\n\nthey relied on Section 5325 of the Domestic Relations Code (the “Code”),1 which states:\n\n      In addition to situations set forth in section 5324 (relating to standing for\n      any form of physical custody or legal custody), grandparents and great-\n      grandparents may file an action under this chapter for partial physical\n      custody or supervised physical custody in the following situations:\n\n      (1) where the parent of the child is deceased, a parent or grandparent of\n      the deceased parent may file an action under this section;\n\n      (2) where the parents of the child have been separated for a period of at\n      least six months or have commenced and continued a proceeding to\n      dissolve their marriage; or\n\n      (3) when the child has, for a period of at least 12 consecutive months,\n      resided with the grandparent or great-grandparent, excluding brief\n      temporary absences of the child from the home, and is removed from the\n      home by the parents, an action must be filed within six months after the\n      removal of the child from the home.\n23 Pa.C.S. §5325 (emphasis added).2\n\n1\n The Domestic Relations Code comprises Title 23 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated\nStatutes. Section 5325 is located in Chapter 53, which governs child custody disputes.\nSee 23 Pa.C.S. §5321. The most recent version of the chapter was enacted in 2010.\nSee Act of Nov. 23, 2010, P.L. 1106, No. 112, Section 2 (as amended 23 Pa.C.S.\n§§5321-5340). That legislation repealed and replaced the prior version, enacted in\n1985, which had been codified at Sections 5301 through 5315.\n\n2\n  Section 5324, referred to in the initial portion of Section 5325 above, gives\ngrandparents standing to seek custody in various situations not implicated here, such as\nwhere a child has been adjudicated dependent or is at substantial risk of harm from the\nparents. See 23 Pa.C.S. §5324(3).\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 2\n\f       In November 2014, the court issued an interim custody order granting shared\n\nlegal custody to Parents and directing that Grandparents continue to have no contact\n\nwith the children. Thereafter, Parents filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the portion\n\nof paragraph (2) of Section 5325 emphasized above violates their Fourteenth\n\nAmendment rights to due process and equal protection. Grandparents submitted a\n\nresponsive pleading observing it was undisputed that Parents had been separated for at\n\nleast six months.\n\n       After briefing and oral argument, the court issued an order granting Parents’\n\nmotion and dismissing the complaint. In an accompanying opinion, the court agreed\n\nwith Parents that Section 5325(2) violates their constitutional rights.         The court\n\nrecognized, initially, that Parents have a fundamental liberty interest in raising their\n\nchildren as they see fit. See D.P. v. G.J.P., No. 1750 of 2014-D, slip op. at 2 (C.P.\n\nWestmoreland Sept. 8, 2015) (quoting Troxel v. Granville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087668\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087668/troxel-v-granville/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087668\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087668/troxel-v-granville/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, the court reasoned, because Section\n\n5325(2) substantially burdens that interest, it can only be upheld if it survives strict\n\nscrutiny – meaning, it must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling government\n\ninterest. See id. at 4.\n\n       Applying strict scrutiny, the court specified that the state has a compelling\n\ninterest, exercised through its parens patriae powers, in protecting the welfare of\n\nchildren who are at risk of harm. In the court’s view, however, Section 5325(2) does not\n\nembody a narrowly-tailored means of serving that interest because it improperly\n\nassumes, based solely on the parents’ separated status, that their joint decisions\n\nregarding the raising of their children are infected by a degree of unfitness. See id. at 6\n\n& n.3. By contrast, the court pointed to paragraphs (1) and (3) as reflecting more\n\npersuasive circumstances to allow for grandparent standing. See id. at 5.\n\n\n                                     [J-53-2016] - 3\n\f         In terms of precedent, the common pleas court recited that, in Hiller v.

Hiller approved standing in favor of a\n\ngrandparent whose child was deceased, see Hiller, 588 Pa. at 365-66, 904 A.2d at 890\n\n(upholding 23 Pa.C.S. §5311 (repealed)), while Schmehl endorsed standing where the\n\nparents were divorced and also disagreed concerning the grandparents’ partial-custody\n\nrequest. See Schmehl, 592 Pa. at 594, 927 A.2d at 190 (sustaining an application of 23\n\nPa.C.S. §5312 (repealed)). The court distinguished those situations, noting that, here,\n\nParents had jointly decided that their children should have no contact with Grandparents\n\n– and suggesting more generally that when any two parents who are merely separated\n\nare in agreement concerning the individuals with whom their children should or should\n\nnot associate, there is no adequate basis to disturb the ordinary presumption, credited\n\nby the United States Supreme Court, that fit parents act in their children’s best interests.\n\nSee D.P., No. 1750 of 2014-D, slip op. at 9 (quoting Troxel, 530 U.S. at 68, 120 S. Ct. at\n\n2061).\n\n         As to this latter point, the court referred to Herron v. Seizak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274886/herron-v-seizak/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.

Super. 2007), both of\n\nwhich involved married parents who agreed that grandparents should not be given\n\nvisitation or custody. See D.P., No. 1750 of 2014-D, slip op. at 9-10. Although Herron\n\nand Helsel dealt with intact families, the county court interpreted the opinions as\n\nprimarily establishing that courts should not upset a unified decision of the child’s\n\nparents at the behest of a third party.       See id. at 10.    Circling back to the equal\n\nprotection facet of Parents’ argument, the court ultimately held that, inasmuch as the\n\nlaw presumes married parents living together are able to co-parent their children without\n\n\n                                       [J-53-2016] - 4\n\fjudicial interference, there was no constitutionally sound basis to support a classification\n\nwhereby married parents who are separated should be treated differently. See id. at\n\n10-11.    In this regard, the court indicated that the statute reflects an inappropriate\n\n“implicit presumption of unfitness” attaching to separated parents solely on account of\n\ntheir separated status. Id. at 11.\n\n         On direct appeal to this Court,3 Grandparents acknowledge that Parents have a\n\nfundamental right to direct the care, custody, and control of their children, thus triggering\n\nstrict scrutiny under the Due Process Clause. They agree with the common pleas court\n\nthat the state interest presently implicated, protecting children’s health and emotional\n\nwellbeing, is a compelling one. Grandparents contend, however, that the statute is\n\nnarrowly drawn to advance that interest because it favors relationships specifically with\n\ngrandparents, and only when the parents have been separated for six months.\n\nGrandparents maintain that this materially distinguishes the statute from the one\n\ndeemed constitutionally problematic in Troxel – which allowed standing in favor of any\n\nperson at any time, see WASH. REV. CODE §26.10.160(3) – particularly in view of the\n\nelevated importance extended-family ties have assumed in recent years due to the\n\nbreakdown of the nuclear family.\n\n         Grandparents observe that Hiller pointed to this aspect of the former Section\n\n2311 as being salient in light of the 1985 enactment’s underlying legislative policy to\n\npromote “continuing contact with . . . grandparents when a parent is deceased, divorced\n\n3\n  Grandparents initially appealed to the Superior Court, where the matter was docketed\nat No. 1577 WDA 2015. The intermediate court transferred the appeal to this Court,\nwhich has exclusive appellate jurisdiction of common pleas court decisions holding that\na statute is unconstitutional. See 42 Pa.C.S. §722(7); see also Pa.R.A.P. 751 (relating\nto the transfer of erroneously-filed cases). While the matter was pending in the Superior\nCourt, Parents notified the Attorney General that a statute’s constitutionality had been\ndrawn into question. See Pa.R.A.P. 521(a) (requiring such notice). However, the\nAttorney General has elected not to participate.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 5\n\for separated.” See Brief for Appellants at 11 (citing Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904 A.2d at\n\n886, and quoting 23 Pa.C.S. §5301 (repealed)).4 Grandparents indicate, moreover, that\n\nHiller approved the statutory scheme involved in that dispute because it required that,\n\nbefore grandparent visitation could be ordered, the court take into account whether such\n\nvisitation would interfere with the parent-child relationship, whether a strong bond\n\nbetween the child and grandparent previously existed, and the child’s best interests\n\ngenerally. See id. at 12 (citing Hiller, 588 Pa. at 361, 904 A.2d at 887). Although\n\nGrandparents do not say so expressly, it is implicit in their argument that they believe\n\nthe same analysis and outcome should obtain under the Due Process Clause in relation\n\nto Section 5325.\n\n         As for equal protection, Grandparents rely largely on Schmehl, which rejected an\n\nequal protection challenge to grandparent standing under Section 5312.5 They maintain\n\nthat, because that section contained language which is similar to Section 5325(2), this\n\nCourt should apply the same constitutional principles here as it did in Schmehl. In\n\nterms of the validity of the classification at issue – parents who co-parent while living\n\n4\n Section 5301 was repealed by the 2010 enactment, see supra note 1, and there is no\nexpression of legislative policy in the present version of Chapter 53.\n\n5\n    Section 5312 stated:\n\n         In all proceedings for dissolution, subsequent to the commencement of the\n         proceeding and continuing thereafter or when parents have been\n         separated for six months or more, the court may, upon application of the\n         parent or grandparent of a party, grant reasonable partial custody or\n         visitation rights, or both, to the unmarried child if it finds that visitation\n         rights or partial custody, or both, would be in the best interest of the child\n         and would not interfere with the parent-child relationship. The court shall\n         consider the amount of personal contact between the parents or\n         grandparents of the party and the child prior to the application.\n\n23 Pa.C.S. §5312 (repealed).\n\n\n                                        [J-53-2016] - 6\n\fseparately, versus parents who co-parent and live together – Grandparents point out,\n\ninitially, that Schmehl expounded upon the analytical overlap between due-process and\n\nequal-protection principles in a context involving the protection of children’s health and\n\nemotional welfare, and they again refer to the breakdown of the nuclear family as an\n\nimportant factor justifying the General Assembly’s decision to allow grandparents to\n\npetition for custody when parents have separated. See Brief for Appellants at 13-15.\n\n       Parents’ argument largely tracks the common pleas court’s analysis with regard\n\nto both the due process and equal protection inquiries.            Briefly, they note it is\n\nestablished law that, because their parental rights are fundamental, the Due Process\n\nClause accords those rights heightened protection.6 Parents counter Grandparents’\n\nposition that the statute is narrowly tailored, arguing: (a) there is no factual basis to\n\npresume based solely on a couple’s separation that their children are at greater risk of\n\nharm; and (b) when presumptively fit parents agree that their children should not\n\ndevelop relationships with specific third parties, simply pointing to the “blood\n\nrelationship” of those third parties is insufficient to justify an invocation of the state’s\n\nparens patriae interest. Brief for Appellees at 28.\n\n       Addressing the topic of potential harm to the children, Parents offer that, in pre-\n\nHiller cases where the state exercised its parens patriae authority, the fitness of the\n\nparent was in question due to abuse, neglect, delinquency, or a failure to perform\n\nparental duties.

As for Hiller itself, Parents read the holding as\n\nresting on an understanding that the death of a parent would naturally tend to harm a\n\nchild’s wellbeing, and that such harm would be magnified if the child also lost contact\n\nwith a grandparent with whom he or she had a pre-existing beneficial relationship.

Parents do not argue that Schmehl was\n\nwrongly decided or that it should be overruled. They do contend, however, that the\n\ncase is distinguishable because: it did not involve a joint decision by both parents, but\n\nrather, a situation in which a divorced father supported his parents’ request for visitation;\n\nand the parents were already subject to a custody order. By contrast, Parents indicate\n\nthey were never subject to a custody order before Grandparents filed their complaint,\n\nnor do they disagree on matters of custody or visitation. Further, they assert that no\n\nreason has been alleged why they are less capable than non-separated parents of\n\nmaking appropriate decisions about their children’s welfare.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 8\n\f       Parents suggest, as well, that many couples who live together lead dysfunctional\n\nhomes and make poor parenting decisions, all of which evidences the arbitrariness of\n\nSection 5325’s implicit assumption that separated parents are less fit as parents than\n\nthose who live under the same roof. Consequently, Parents propose that the legislative\n\nclassification which rests on that assumption does little to advance the state’s interest in\n\nprotecting children or promoting their welfare. See id. at 35-36. Finally, Parents draw\n\nsupport for their position from a responsive expression in Schmehl in which former Chief\n\nJustice Cappy opined that separation and divorce are not valid proxies for ascertaining\n\nwhich parents might cause harm to their children.

Physical custody refers to the “physical possession and control of a child.”\n23 Pa.C.S. §5322(a). As noted, partial physical custody is defined as physical custody\nfor less than a majority of the time. See id. Chapter 53 as enacted in 1985 regulated\nvisitation and custody, whereas the 2010 version only governs custody. In our present\ndiscussion, we mention custody and visitation because some of the authority from other\njurisdictions relates to visitation and the constitutional analysis, for present purposes, is\nmaterially identical.\n\n\n                                       [J-53-2016] - 9\n\fand that, as such, it is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment’s due-process and\n\nequal-protection guarantees.

In light\n\nof these factors there is also no disagreement that, to survive a due process or equal\n\nprotection challenge, Section 5325 must satisfy the constitutional standard known as\n\nstrict scrutiny.\n\n       The basic features of strict scrutiny, relating to whether the governmental action\n\nis narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest, see Hiller, 588 Pa. at 359, 904 A.2d at\n\n885-86, are well established.     As expressed in Schmehl, the inquiries per the Due\n\nProcess and Equal Protection Clauses are distinct but overlapping: pursuant to the\n\nformer, the government’s infringement on fundamental rights must be necessary to\n\nadvance a compelling state interest, whereas under the latter it is the classification\n\ninherent in the statute which must be necessary to achieve that interest. See Schmehl,\n\n592 Pa. at 589, 927 A.2d at 187.8\n\n       Broadly speaking, the state, acting pursuant to its parens patriae power, has a\n\ncompelling interest in safeguarding children from various kinds of physical and\n\nemotional harm and promoting their wellbeing.9 See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 359, 904 A.2d at\n\n8\n  Strict scrutiny is separately triggered under the Equal Protection Clause if the\nlegislation employs a suspect classification.

Hiller arose in a situation where the mother had\n\ndied and the maternal grandmother sought to continue an existing relationship with the\n\nminor child. This Court upheld the common pleas court’s application of the statute, 23\n\nPa.C.S. §5311 (repealed), observing that the provision was materially limited in scope\n\nto the deceased-parent scenario and only provided for custody in favor of a grandparent\n\non the deceased parent’s side, see Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904 A.2d at 886, where the\n\nrisk appears greatest that a pre-existing grandparent relationship may be severed.\n\n\n10\n   Aside from issues relating to family relationships, the government’s interest in\nprotecting children and promoting their welfare may also be served via its police power\nas reflected in enactments regulating child labor, requiring school attendance, vaccines,\nand motor-vehicle child safety seats, and imposing criminal liability for corrupting or\notherwise harming minors.

Compare 23 Pa.C.S. §5312 (repealed) (allowing for grandparent partial custody\n\nor visitation during “proceedings for dissolution . . . or when parents have been\n\nseparated for six months or more”), with 23 Pa.C.S. §5325(2) (giving grandparents\n\nstanding “where the parents of the child have been separated for a period of at least six\n\nmonths or have commenced and continued a proceeding to dissolve their marriage”).\n\nStill, Schmehl involved divorced parents, see generally Schmehl, 592 Pa. at 593 n.9,\n\n927 A.2d at 189 n.9 (citing scholarship concerning the effects of divorce on children);\n\nsee also id. at 591, 927 A.2d at 188-89 (discussing prior judicial expressions regarding\n\nthe impact of divorce on families), who were not in agreement concerning grandparent\n\ncustody.

The objecting parent in Schmehl only sought a declaration that the\n\nstatute was invalid in the divorce setting, and the grandparents defended the statutory\n\nclassification by emphasizing that, unlike with intact families, “[t]he state must oversee a\n\ndivorce action, and arrange for custody, support and visitation in some cases.” Brief for\n\nAppellants in Schmehl v.

Hiller\n\nnoted that common pleas courts are required to apply a presumption that parents act in\n\ntheir children’s best interests, and that such presumption applies regardless of whether\n\nthe statute facially necessitates it. See Hiller, 588 Pa. at 361, 904 A.2d at 887 (“In\n\naddition to the language of the statute, our precedent requires our courts to . . . provide\n\na presumption in favor of the decision of a fit parent.”).

See id. at 365-66, 904 A.2d at 890.\n\n       By referring to the established presumption in favor of fit parents and Section\n\n5311’s requirements, Hiller rested its holding, in significant part, on considerations\n\nrelating to the preliminary question of standing.13         Most notably, the “stringent\n\n12\n   Section 5311 was similar to Section 5312, see supra note 5, although it referred to a\nsituation where the parent was deceased.

That Hiller’s constitutional analysis centered on the\n\npropriety of grandparent standing in the context which arose in that dispute is made\n\nexplicit in its explanation that, “[u]nlike the statute in Troxel, which extended standing to\n\nany person at any time, Section 5311 narrowly limits those who can seek visitation or\n\npartial custody . . . to grandparents whose child has died.” Hiller, 588 Pa. at 360, 904\n\nA.2d at 886; see also Schmehl, 592 Pa. at 588, 927 A.2d at 187 (characterizing Hiller as\n\nholding that Section 5311 was “narrowly tailored . . . because it extend[ed] standing” to\n\na limited, defined subset of grandparents).\n\n       Schmehl’s understanding of the aspect of Section 5312 at issue in that matter\n\nwas similarly couched. See id. at 584-85, 927 A.2d at 184 (summarizing the mother’s\n\nargument that equal protection norms were offended by Section 5312 because\n\n“standing to obtain partial custody or visitation is not afforded to grandparents of\n\nchildren whose parents are married and living together,” while it is afforded to the\n\ngrandparents of children whose parents are divorced or separated).\n\n       The focus on standing is sharpened even further in the present controversy: the\n\ncommon pleas court, unlike in Hiller and Schmehl, never reached the complaint’s merits\n\nbecause it determined that the statutory basis for standing was unconstitutional. In this\n\nrespect, it is notable that the redrafted Chapter 53, more expressly than its predecessor,\n\nsegregates    grandparent     standing   requirements     (Section    5325)    from   merits\n\nconsiderations (Section 5328).14 Therefore, as illustrated presently, whenever there are\n\ncontested issues relating to standing, the chapter gives parents the ability to bifurcate\n\n\n\n14\n  The 1985 version of Chapter 23 also had sections nominally devoted to standing and\nmerits, see 23 Pa.C.S. §§5313 (repealed), 5303 (repealed), but the merits section was\nvery brief and such considerations were intermixed in Sections 5311 and 5312.\n\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 14\n\fthe proceedings by seeking dismissal for lack of standing, thereby requiring that any\n\nsuch preliminary questions be resolved before the complaint’s merits are reached.\n\n       The potential for such bifurcation serves an important screening function in terms\n\nof protecting parental rights. As suggested, it facilitates early dismissal of complaints,\n\nthereby relieving families of the burden of litigating their merits where a sufficient basis\n\nfor standing is absent.

In the event of a major disruption to the\n\nfamily environment, such as where there is parental abuse, neglect, substance abuse,\n\nmental illness, or abandonment, the interest may be especially pronounced.

Nevertheless, where there is no reason to believe presumptively\n\nfit parents are not acting in their children’s best interests, the government’s interest in\n\nallowing a third party to supplant their decisions is diminished. See generally Conlogue,\n\n890 A.2d at 694 (expressing, as a general precept, that “something more than the best\n\ninterest of the child must be at stake in order to establish a compelling state interest”);\n\nTroxel, 530 U.S. at 72-73, 120 S.

As this case shows, when parents separate they do not always\n\ninitiate divorce proceedings or otherwise request court involvement in their family\n\naffairs. See generally Brief for Appellees at 35-36 (“Parents are merely separated and\n\nnot subject to a custody order. . . . Parents have the ability to reconcile.”).

Further, Grandparents and\n\nthe Attorney General – who, as noted, has decided not to participate in this litigation,\n\nsee supra note 3 – have not put before this Court any empirical data corresponding to\n\nthat referenced in Schmehl tending to suggest that separation has the same adverse\n\neffects upon children as divorce.\n\n       As well, unlike in Hiller, separation necessarily implies that both parents are still\n\nalive, which in turn has several consequences. First, there is no void stemming from\n\nthe death of a parent. Second, parental death cannot be the cause of the severance or\n\nnon-existence of a grandparent-grandchild relationship. Finally, when both parents are\n\nliving there is a possibility – as illustrated by this case – that the parents will be in\n\nagreement that their children should not maintain contact with particular third parties.17\n\nThese factors render any court-mandated association with such third parties more\n\nintrusive to the parents’ constitutional prerogatives than in a context where the parents\n\nhave already invoked the court’s oversight as to matters of custody and/or marital\n\ndissolution.   See generally Hawk v. Hawk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1669174\"><a href=\"/opinion/1669174/hawk-v-hawk/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 577 (Tenn. 1993)\n\n(“Although courts are commonly called on to resolve custody disputes between parents\n\nand to determine custody when parents are unfit, the trial court’s interference with the\n\n\n\n\n17\n  We recognize that parental agreement of this nature is possible with divorced parents\nand parents who have commenced marriage dissolution proceedings.

It follows that the\n\ninfringement upon parental rights worked by Section 5325 is not narrowly tailored to a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, as the provision could have been drafted to exclude\n\nseparation as an independent basis for grandparent standing. See Danson v.

Fallon, Jr., Strict\n\nJudicial Scrutiny, 54 UCLA L. REV. 1267, 1328 (2007) (observing that a legislative\n\nenactment can fail the narrow-tailoring component of strict scrutiny if it is\n\n“overinclusive”).    Consequently, Section 5325 cannot survive strict scrutiny and, as\n\nsuch, it violates the fundamental rights of parents safeguarded by the Due Process\n\nClause.18\n\n         Although we have concluded that Section 5325 is not narrowly tailored, it is\n\nevident from our discussion that this determination rests solely on the conferral of\n\nstanding under paragraph (2), the only aspect of Section 5325 that has been brought\n\ninto question in this action. Moreover, paragraph (2) is itself divided into two parts and\n\nphrased in the disjunctive, as it provides for grandparent standing “where the parents of\n\nthe child have been separated for a period of at least six months or have commenced\n\n18\n     In view of our disposition, we need not reach the Equal Protection claim.\n\n\n                                       [J-53-2016] - 19\n\fand continued a proceeding to dissolve their marriage[.]”             23 Pa.C.S. §5325(2)\n\n(emphasis added).       It is noteworthy that these are separate and independent\n\npreconditions for grandparent standing, since it is possible for parents who have not\n\nbeen separated for at least six months to commence and continue a dissolution\n\nproceeding. Thus, the difficulties apparent in the first half of paragraph (2) do not imply\n\nthat the second half – or, for that matter, paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) – is also\n\nproblematic.\n\n       The above informs our decision concerning the appropriate remedy, and in\n\nparticular, the question of severance. In Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New\n\nEngland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145691\"><a href=\"/opinion/145691/ayotte-v-planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-eng/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145691\"><a href=\"/opinion/145691/ayotte-v-planned-parenthood-of-northern-new-eng/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court continued that “a statute may be declared\n\ninvalid to the extent that it reaches too far, but otherwise left intact.” Id. at 329, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 968 (ellipsis, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted).       In salvaging a\n\nstatute to the extent possible without judicially rewriting it, Ayotte observed that the\n\n“touchstone” for the remedy is legislative intent, that is, asking whether the “legislature\n\n[would] have preferred what is left of its statute to no statute at all[.]” Id. at 330, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 968 (citing, inter alia, United States v.

Although there is no express severability\n\nprovision contained in Act 112 of 2010 or any aspect of the Domestic Relations Code\n\napplicable to Chapter 53, the Statutory Construction Act directs, as general policy, that\n\nall statutory provisions are presumed to be severable, and that if any provision is held to\n\nbe invalid the remainder of the statute which contains it\n\n       shall not be affected thereby, unless the court finds that the valid\n       provisions of the statute are so essentially and inseparably connected\n\n                                      [J-53-2016] - 20\n\f       with, and so depend upon, the void provision or application, that it cannot\n       be presumed the General Assembly would have enacted the remaining\n       valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the\n       remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are\n       incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\n1 Pa.C.S. §1925. Thus, severance is appropriate where the remaining provisions are\n\ncapable of execution in accordance with legislative intent. See, e.g., Commonwealth v.\n\nMockaitis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">575</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 29-30, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155193/com-v-mockaitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502-03 (2003).\n\n       As noted, paragraphs (1) and (3) of Section 5325, as well as the second half of\n\nparagraph (2), set out separate and distinct bases for grandparent standing that do not\n\ndepend on the first half of paragraph (2), that is, on the parents having been separated\n\nfor at least six months. Since these are not “essentially and inseparably connected\n\nwith” the separation provision, they are capable of execution and may continue in force\n\nabsent the first half of paragraph (2). Such provisions, moreover, are neither implicated\n\nby the underlying facts nor challenged by the parties.\n\n       As concerns the second half of paragraph (2) in particular, invalidating it per the\n\nsuggestion forwarded by Justices Baer and Wecht would require reaching beyond the\n\nbounds of this dispute and declaring Section 5325 unconstitutional more broadly than is\n\nnecessary to resolve the appeal. It would be premature – and thus improper – to make\n\na wide-reaching constitutional declaration along these lines in the present context in\n\nwhich no challenge to the standing requirements relative to divorced parents has been\n\nraised or briefed. We thus differ with any suggestion that we are somehow “avoiding”\n\nthis issue. Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, slip op. at 4 n.2 (Baer, J.).\n\n       More generally, it should be recalled that our “adjudicatory process is structured\n\nto cast a narrow focus on matters framed by litigants before the Court in a highly\n\ndirected fashion,” Sernovitz v.
