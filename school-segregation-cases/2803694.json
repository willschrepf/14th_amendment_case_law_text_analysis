On May 17, 2010, a jury found him guilty, and,\r\nafter a separate punishment hearing, the jury answered the future-dangerousness special issue\r\n\"yes,\" the anti-parties special issue \"yes,\" the mental-retardation special issue \"no,\" and the\r\nmitigation special issue \"no.\"<sup> (2)</sup> The trial judge set appellant's punishment at death.<sup> (3)</sup> Direct\r\nappeal to this Court is automatic.<sup> (4)</sup>  After reviewing appellant's twenty points of error, we find\r\nthem to be without merit and affirm the conviction and death sentence.  We note at the outset\r\nthat appellant challenges neither the sufficiency of the evidence to support the guilty verdict\r\nnor the determination that appellant is not mentally retarded. Because appellant does\r\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the future-dangerousness special issue,\r\nwe set out, at some length, the facts of the crime and relevant punishment evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A. \tThe State's Guilt-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt 10:37 a.m. on December 2, 2008,  appellant called 911, and the first thing he said\r\nwas, \"My name is Blaine Milam, and my daughter, I just found her dead.\"   Rusk County\r\nPatrol Sergeant Kevin Roy arrived at appellant's trailer home outside Tatum twenty minutes\r\nlater.  Two ambulances were already there.  EMTs were standing in the doorway of the\r\nmaster bedroom, where appellant and Jesseca Carson were kneeling on the floor.  Sgt. Roy\r\nsaw \"an infant laying on the floor not moving, not breathing, bruised. The baby was laying\r\non its back, and the face of the baby was just one large bruise.\"  He thought that the circular\r\nbruises he saw on the child's body were caused by a Coke can.  He did not recognize them\r\nas human bite marks.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter lead investigator Sergeant Amber Rogers arrived, Sgt. Roy took appellant aside\r\nto talk while Sgt. Rogers talked to Jesseca.  Appellant told Sgt. Roy that he and Jesseca had\r\nleft Amora alone in the trailer and walked up the road to meet a man named Clark who was\r\ngoing to clear some land for him.  They were gone about an hour, and, when they came back,\r\nthey found \"the baby in that condition.\"  Appellant was calm, collected, and cooperative.\r\nAfter the interviews, Sgt. Roy read the pair their <em>Miranda</em> rights.  He told them that, when\r\nthe crime-scene investigation was done, they would be taken to the Sheriff's office for more\r\nquestioning and collection of their clothes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShortly thereafter, Kenny Ray, a Texas Ranger, arrived and noticed Jesseca and\r\nappellant embracing.  To Ranger Ray, the two looked like \"grieving parents,\" not suspects. \r\nRanger Ray conducted an hour-long interview with appellant in the front seat of his patrol\r\ncar.  Appellant told the ranger that authorities were \"more than welcome\" to search his car\r\nand home.  Appellant denied involvement in Amora's death.  He also gave Ranger Ray\r\nnames of possible suspects and said that whoever did this should \"be hung.\"  In that recorded\r\ninterview, appellant explained that Jesseca was his fiancee and that Amora was Jesseca's\r\nchild, but that they both lived with him and he was \"raising that baby.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant then told Ranger Ray the same story that he had told Sgt. Roy.  He added\r\nthat, when he and Jesseca got home, they found Amora, not in her crib, but in a hole in the\r\nfloor in the bathroom that he was remodeling.  Appellant said Amora had a blood ring around\r\nher mouth, and \"it looked like she had been biting the insulation.\"  She was still breathing,\r\nso they called 911.  Appellant later told Ranger Ray that Jesseca called 911 before they found\r\nAmora, and that when they found her, she was dead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRanger Ray's tone eventually became accusatory.  He told appellant that he knew he\r\nwas lying, that no one would believe his story, and that everyone would think he had beat the\r\nbaby because he was the only male in the house. Appellant again denied any involvement \r\nin Amora's death  and offered to take a polygraph test.  Finally, Ranger Ray told appellant\r\nthat he was free to go, meaning that he was free to get out of the patrol car, but not to leave\r\nthe scene.  By then, Ranger Ray considered appellant a suspect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe ranger also interviewed Jesseca. At first she \"was crying and acting very\r\ndistraught,\" but then there was a \"pretty drastic\" change in her demeanor.  She referred to\r\nAmora  as \"that baby\" and told Ranger Ray an \"extremely bizarre story.\"<sup> (5)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe medical examiner gave Amora's cause of death as homicidal violence, due to\r\nmultiple blunt-force injuries and possible strangulation.  He detailed her injuries: facial\r\nabrasions and bruises; twenty-four human bite marks; bruises, scrapes, and abrasions from\r\nhead to toe; bleeding underneath the scalp; extensive fracturing to the back of the skull;\r\nbleeding between the brain and the skull; a laceration to the brain tissue as well as swelling,\r\nbleeding, and bruising; bleeding around the optic nerves; bleeding in the eyes and around the\r\njugular vein; fractures to the right arm and leg; eighteen rib fractures; a tear to the liver; and\r\nextensive injury to the genitals. There were no old injuries suggesting a pattern of abuse.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe investigation quickly poked holes in appellant's story. Shane and Dwight Clark,\r\nof Clark Timber, denied any meeting with appellant on December 2nd.  Crystal Dopson,\r\nmanager of the Insta-Cash Pawn Shop in Henderson, said that, shortly after she opened the\r\nshop on December 2nd, Jesseca and appellant came in and pawned an electric chain saw and\r\nan air impact tool. Surveillance video showed the two in the pawn shop for about fifteen\r\nminutes.  Surveillance video from the Exxon in Henderson picked them up shortly thereafter.\r\nAlso, appellant had called his sister, Teresa Shea, that morning before 9:30 a.m., crying and\r\nsaying that he had \"found Amora dead.\" Teresa told him to call 911, but appellant did not do\r\nso until 10:37 a.m.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 11th, investigators conducted  a second search of appellant's trailer and\r\ndetermined that the south end of the trailer, rather than the master bedroom, was probably the\r\ncrime scene.  They found blood-spatter stains, consistent with blunt force trauma, near the\r\nsouth bedroom.  Among the items collected from the south bedroom were:  blood-stained\r\nbedding and baby clothes; blood-stained baby diapers and wipes; a tube of Astroglide\r\nlubricant; and a pair of jeans with blood stains on the lap.  DNA testing later showed that\r\nAmora's blood was on these items.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 13th, appellant's sister, Teresa, went to see appellant in jail.  That night,\r\nshe told her aunt that she \"was needing to find a way to get back out to the trailer in Tatum\"\r\nbecause \"Blaine had told her that she needed to go out there to the trailer to get some\r\nevidence out from underneath of it.\"  The aunt called Sgt. Rogers and told her that \"she\r\nneeded to get out to the trailer immediately, that Teresa was wanting to go out there to get\r\nsome evidence out from underneath the trailer.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSgt. Rogers immediately obtained a search warrant, crawled under the trailer, and\r\ndiscovered a pipe wrench inside a clear plastic bag.  The pipe wrench had been shoved down\r\n\"a hole in the floor of the master bathroom.\"  Forensic analysis revealed components of\r\nAstroglide on the pipe wrench, the diaper Amora had been wearing, and the diaper and wipes\r\ncollected from the south bedroom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Robert Williams, a forensic odontologist, compared the bite marks found on\r\nAmora's body with bite dentition models obtained from appellant, Jesseca, and appellant's\r\nbrother Danny Milam. Dr. Williams testified that, to \"a reasonable degree of dental\r\ncertainty,\" appellant's dentition matched eight bite marks on Amora.  He could exclude\r\nJesseca from all but one of the bite marks, and he could exclude Danny from all of the bite\r\nmarks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShirley Broyles, the nurse at the Rusk County Jail, testified that appellant called for\r\nher one day in January.  She found him crying in his cell. He handed her a written request to\r\ntalk to Sgt. Rogers, and told Ms. Broyles: \"I'm going to confess.  I did it.  But Ms. Shirley,\r\nthe Blaine you know did not do this.  My dad told me to be a man, and I've been reading my\r\nBible.  Please tell Jesseca I love her.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B. \tThe Defense Guilt-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's defense focused on Jesseca as the murderer.  The defense called Heather\r\nCarson, Jesseca's mother, who said that Jesseca and appellant starting dating around January\r\n2008 and got engaged a few months later.  Jesseca moved in with appellant and his parents\r\nthat spring.  When Jesseca turned eighteen, she received an insurance settlement from her\r\nfather's 2001 death.  Heather noticed an immediate change in Jesseca; she became \r\nwithdrawn and stopped caring about her appearance.  Jesseca started harassing Heather with\r\ntelephone calls. When Heather learned that Jesseca was making serious and unfounded\r\nallegations against her, she stopped talking to her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLisa Taylor testified that Jesseca was her daughter's best friend while growing up in\r\nAlabama.  Ms. Taylor knew Jessica as \"sweet, outgoing, outspoken, funny.\"  She said that\r\nJesseca, appellant, and Amora visited them in Alabama twice in the fall of 2008.  First,  they\r\ncame for one night in October. Jesseca was making \"bizarre\" accusations about her mother. \r\nIn November, the trio returned to Alabama for about four days and said that they were\r\nplanning to move there.  Ms. Taylor said that there was a \"drastic change\" in Jesseca's\r\ndemeanor.  She was \"[w]eird, hollow. . . [l]ike empty.\"  Looking into her eyes was \"like\r\nlooking into a dark space.\"  Jesseca was not taking care of Amora and did not give her a bath\r\nfor the whole week.  She had appellant change Amora's diaper and feed her.   Jesseca\r\nseemed in charge, and when she told appellant to do something, he did it.  Ms. Taylor was\r\nconcerned that there was something profound going on in Jesseca's life and was worried\r\nabout her and her baby.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Murphy, testified that he was asked to \"offer an opinion in\r\nthis case of the mental state of Jesseca Carson for the time period beginning sometime around\r\nAugust of 2008 through December 2nd of 2008.\"  Dr. Murphy read interviews with Jesseca\r\nand other materials but did not talk to Jesseca.  Dr. Murphy said Jesseca's symptoms were\r\nconsistent with a \"psychotic depression . . . .  The depression occurs first, and then it gets\r\nsevere enough that psychosis or loss of touch with reality then occurs . . . .  Psychosis means\r\nsomeone has lost touch with reality. The vast majority of times, that means either they're\r\nhallucinating or they're delusional.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defense odontologist, Dr. Isaac, studied five of the bite marks, and could not\r\nexclude either appellant or Jesseca.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C. \tThe State's Punishment-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State offered evidence that appellant was-at the time of this crime-on probation\r\nfor solicitation of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of fourteen.  Appellant\r\nhad entered the home of an eleven-year-old neighbor, Karah Hodges, and left a stack of\r\npages torn from pornographic magazines, marked with salacious notes, in Karah's dresser\r\ndrawer.  Appellant's probation terms prohibited him from going within \"200 feet of a\r\npremise where children commonly gather, including school, daycare facility, playground,\r\npublic or private youth center, public swimming pool, or video facility.\" Appellant's \"mere\r\npresence\" with Amora was, therefore, a continuing probation violation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRanger Ray was recalled to play the entire patrol-car conversation he had recorded\r\nwith appellant.  Appellant had told Ranger Ray that a third party had forced him to solicit\r\nKarah Hodges.  He also discussed several assaults, all of which he described as being of the\r\n\"he had it coming\" variety.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGlenda Risinger, who rented an apartment to appellant and Jesseca in the fall of 2008,\r\ntestified that when the pair left, the apartment \"was trashed. There was stuff left everywhere.\r\nThe refrigerator was left open with food still in it. . . . It was pretty much just like they just\r\nwent through and trashed it.\"  She also found a lightbulb containing methamphetamine and\r\na hunting knife in the toilet tank.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBryan Perkins, appellant's former boss, testified that appellant had  \"control issues\"\r\nand a \"very short\" fuse.  Appellant would bring Jesseca to work to keep an eye on her. Mr.\r\nPerkins said, \"I started talking to him about his controlling problems, you know, that if he\r\nkept on controlling his woman, she was going to leave him. And, you know, he just said it\r\nseemed like, you know, with that baby, him and Jesseca were not really going to have a life.\" \r\nMr. Perkins also described a fight appellant had with a customer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMonty Clark, a Rusk County patrol deputy, testified that, in January 2008, he\r\nresponded to a fight on the side of the road between appellant and his brother, Danny.  He\r\narrested appellant for assault and family violence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Kenneth McDade, a fellow  inmate, testified that appellant told him about a plan to\r\nescape from the jail and also threatened to stab him with a pencil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJesseca's friend, Crystal Zapata, described an incident that occurred after appellant's\r\nfather died in September but before Amora was killed in December.  Ms. Zapata was inside\r\nthe trailer with Amora, while appellant and Jesseca were arguing outside.  Appellant had a\r\ngun and threatened suicide; Jesseca was trying to calm him down. Ms. Zapata heard a\r\ngunshot.  After a few minutes Jesseca came in the door crying and told Ms. Zapata that he\r\nhad shot into the floorboard of her car when she tried to keep him from leaving. Ms. Zapata\r\ncharacterized appellant as dominant in the relationship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D. \tThe Defense Punishment-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defense sought to rebut the State's future-dangerousness evidence with both lay\r\nand expert witnesses.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's mother, Shirley Milam, attributed appellant's solicitation of aggravated\r\nsexual assault to his mental immaturity.  She said he stopped maturing emotionally at age\r\ntwelve.  She testified that appellant had an on-and-off methamphetamine problem and that\r\nhe had started using drugs again shortly after his father's death.  Shirley testified that, after\r\nthe second time appellant tried to commit suicide to \"go be with [his] daddy,\" she\r\nunsuccessfully tried to have him civilly committed.  In early November, Jesseca and\r\nappellant brought a Ouija board to Shirley's work and told her that they could communicate\r\nwith their dead fathers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's older sister testified that appellant was a polite, passive child and a polite,\r\npassive adult.  This crime was completely out of character for him.  Appellant's childhood\r\nfriend said that he did not think appellant was capable of Amora's murder or aggravated\r\nsexual assault.  He echoed what appellant's family members said about the effect of his\r\nfather's death:  \"It affected him really bad, because like him and his dad was real close.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Patricia Rosen, a medical toxicologist, testified that toxicology reports indicated\r\nthat appellant had 0.17 milligrams of methamphetamine per liter of blood in his system on\r\nDecember 2nd.  Dr. Rosen said this was a \"high\" dose-ten times the therapeutic dose. \r\nAnother expert testified about the effects of methamphetamine on the brain and gave her\r\nopinion that appellant was a chronic methamphetamine user, whose heavy use could have\r\ncaused severe psychosis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Mark Cunningham, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified that he was asked\r\nto evaluate two issues concerning appellant: 1) \"how did we get here?\" and 2) \"where do we\r\ngo from here?\" Dr.  Cunningham interviewed appellant three times, for a total of nearly ten\r\nhours.  He also interviewed appellant's mother and sisters, and reviewed \"a huge volume of\r\nrecords.\"  Dr. Cunningham summarized the answer to the \"how did we get here\" question: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere's mental deficiency, youthfulness, meth dependence, meth psychosis,\r\nJesseca's psychosis. Those are all interacting with each other. That's all part\r\nof the matrix of his psyche. Now, it's not just those things, of course. There's\r\nalso the trauma and deprivation, the social deprivation I'm describing, as well\r\nas the trauma of his dad's illness, and those experiences. There is the social\r\nisolation that came about that robs him of social resources that he might have\r\ncalled upon for some reality testing. There's premature responsibility. There's\r\nthe death of his father. All of these things are being loaded on and are\r\ninteracting with each other, as we're coming up to this offense, and the effect\r\nof that is this tragedy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Cunningham answered the \"where do we go from here?\" question by outlining the\r\nreasons why appellant was \"likely to have a nonviolent adjustment, in terms of no serious\r\nviolence, to a life without parole sentence in TDCJ.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><span>\tAppellant's \"nonviolent adjustment to 17 months jail pretrial\";<sup> (6)</sup></span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\t\"Appraisal of the correctional staff was not that [appellant] was going to be a\r\npredatory inmate that they needed to lock down\";</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tAppellant's history of employment: starting work at 16, and gaining \"a pretty\r\nsignificant employment history for a kid that's arrested when he's 18\";</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tAppellant's continuing contact and relationship with family;</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tThe relatively low rate of major assaults committed by capital inmates serving\r\na life term;</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tThe fact of serving a sentence of life without parole (\"inmates facing\r\nlife-without-parole sentences and long sentences have more to lose.

We address these points together because \"[o]ur construction\r\nof 'custody' for purposes of Article 38.22 is consistent with the meaning of 'custody' for\r\npurposes of <em>Miranda</em>.\"<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court recently reiterated the test for determining whether a person is in\r\ncustody for purposes of <em>Miranda</em>: The first step \"is to ascertain whether, in light of the\r\nobjective circumstances of the interrogation, a reasonable person would have felt he or she</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\"<sup> (9)</sup>  If the answer is \"yes,\" then we\r\nask the \"additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently\r\ncoercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda</em>.\"<sup> (10)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Dowthitt</em>, we outlined four general situations which <em>may</em> constitute custody: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(1) when the suspect is physically deprived of his freedom of action in any\r\nsignificant way; (2) when a law enforcement officer tells the suspect that he\r\ncannot leave; (3) when law enforcement officers create a situation that would\r\nlead a reasonable person to believe that his freedom of movement has been\r\nsignificantly restricted; and  (4) when there is probable cause to arrest [and the\r\nofficers' knowledge of probable cause is communicated to the suspect] and\r\nlaw enforcement officers do not tell the suspect that he is free to leave.<sup> (11)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>These situations <em>will</em> indicate custody if the circumstances would lead a reasonable person\r\nto believe that he is under restraint to the degree associated with an arrest.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe afford almost total deference to a trial judge's \"custody\" ruling when the questions\r\nof historical fact turn on credibility or demeanor, and otherwise review the ruling <em>de novo</em>.<sup> (13)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation-\"the location\r\nof the questioning, its duration, statements made during the interview, the presence or\r\nabsence of physical restraints during the questioning, and the release of the interviewee at\r\nthe end of the questioning\"<sup> (14)</sup>-to determine whether a reasonable person in appellant's shoes\r\nwould have felt he was not at liberty to end the interrogation and leave.<sup> (15)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant agreed to talk to Ranger Ray, and the questioning took place in the ranger's\r\npatrol car parked in appellant's driveway.  The interview was relatively short, just under one\r\nhour.  Statements made to and questions asked of appellant ranged from friendly to\r\naccusatory.  Appellant was not handcuffed or physically restrained, and he was released from\r\nthe patrol car at the end of the interview.  But, as appellant points out, before talking to\r\nRanger Ray, he had been told that he would be taken to the county jail for further questions\r\nand the collection of his clothes. He told Ranger Ray, as the interview was ending,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Appellant:\tYeah, and they're taking me and Jess up to the police station.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Ray:\t\tI don't know anything about that.  Okay.  Well, I tell you what, let's-let me-let\r\nme put just a little old ending on this tape. It's approximately 12:36 p.m., and,\r\nagain, I'm-this is Sergeant Kenny Ray with the Texas Rangers out of Tyler,\r\nand I've been conducting a noncustodial interview with Blain Keith Milam at\r\nhis residence in the northern part of Rusk County on County Road 2125. And\r\nyou are free to go, my friend.  Thank you for talking to me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Appellant:\tAll right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tUnder these circumstances, the various law-enforcement officers created a situation\r\nthat could possibly lead a reasonable person to believe that his freedom of movement had\r\nbeen significantly, if temporarily, restricted. We therefore look to the additional question of\r\n\"whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the\r\ntype of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda</em>.\"<sup> (16)</sup> Or as stated in <em>Dowthitt</em>, we look\r\nto see if the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that he is under restraint\r\nto the degree associated with an arrest.<sup> (17)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court, in <em>Howes v. Fields</em>, singled out communicated non-custodial\r\nstatus as the most important factor in determining that an inmate taken from his cell to a\r\nprison conference room for questioning about events that occurred outside the prison was not\r\n\"in custody\" for <em>Miranda</em>.<sup> (18)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat critical factor was present here.  Ranger Ray consistently told appellant he was\r\nnot in custody:  \"you're not under arrest\"; \"you don't have handcuffs on\"; \"we're just sitting\r\nand visiting\"; \"you know you're not under arrest.  You're not in custody, okay\"; \"You can\r\ndo whatever you want.  You're not under arrest\"; \"We're through talking.  Like I told you,\r\nyou're sitting in my car.  You don't have handcuffs on.  You came over here voluntarily. \r\nWe've just-we've just been sitting here talking.  You're not-You're fixing to just get out and\r\nwalk out.  I mean, you're not under arrest.  I'm telling you that right now.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant knew that he was not free to leave the crime scene, but that fact would not\r\nstrike any reasonable person, standing in appellant's shoes, as unusual or indicative of his\r\n\"arrest\" or that of anyone else.  This was a major violent crime.  Reasonable people are well\r\naware that, as a matter of course, evidence is collected from crime scenes and from the\r\npeople present at crime scenes.<sup> (19)</sup> Further, appellant was told that his mother and brother\r\nwould also be taken to the police station and then brought back.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Appellant:\tWhere's my mama?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Roy:\t\tHer and Danny went up to the office. . . Same thing they're going to do with\r\nyou and Jesseca.

We're not going to leave you stranded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State notes that the various officers can be heard on the dash-cam audio talking\r\nto each other and to appellant's brother, stating that no one was in custody.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGiven all of the circumstances, we cannot say that the trial judge abused his discretion\r\nin finding that appellant was not in custody when he was interviewed by Ranger Ray.<sup> (20)</sup> \r\nAdmission of the resulting oral statement-which contained no confession--did not violate\r\nArticle 38.22 or the Fifth Amendment.  Points of error 1 and 2 are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B.\tVoir Dire Issues. </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>1.\tVeniremember Trzeciak </strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his third point of error, appellant claims that the trial judge erred by granting the</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>State's challenge for cause against veniremember Trzeciak in violation of <em>Witherspoon v.\r\nIllinois</em><sup> (21)</sup> and <em>Wainwright v. Witt</em>.<sup> (22)</sup>   In a capital prosecution, a prospective juror is not subject\r\nto a challenge for cause merely because he is opposed to or has \"conscientious scruples\"\r\nabout the death penalty.<sup> (23)</sup>  Under <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Witt</em>, however, the trial judge may excuse\r\nprospective jurors based upon their views of the death penalty if these views would \"prevent\r\nor substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\r\ninstructions and his oath.\"<sup> (24)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion in ruling on a challenge\r\nfor cause, we review the voir dire record in its entirety and ask whether the judge had a\r\nrational basis for his ruling.<sup> (25)</sup>  We grant the trial judge considerable deference, because he\r\nis in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror's demeanor and responses.<sup> (26)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the trial judge instructed the prospective jurors that they should not come\r\nforward at the end of the judge's voir dire to discuss their feelings about the death penalty,\r\nbut instead should wait until they were called individually.  Despite that request, venireman\r\nTrzeciak came forward and indicated that he did not think that there were any circumstances\r\nin which he could vote for the death penalty.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak:\tMy thought on that is-I wanted to share with the Court that I don't believe\r\nthere's a circumstance where I could condone or vote for the death penalty,\r\nbased on my personal religious beliefs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Judge:\tAll right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tMr. Trzeciak, basically, you just wanted to come tell the Court that no matter\r\nwhat circumstances may be out there, you've already decided you could not\r\nconsider the death penalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tI cannot do that, yes.<center></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tIrrelevant of whatever that may be?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tIrrelevant of whatever that may be.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tYou felt compelled to come tell us that now, rather than waiting to\r\nquestioning, because you feel that strongly about it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak:\tWell, I feel that strongly about it, and I didn't want to waste the Court's time\r\nin the future.

Could you answer that question truthfully, if so\r\ninstructed?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tWell, I'm going to try.  I understand the question you're asking.  If you're\r\nasking.  I would then go back to-in today's society, in my opinion and the\r\nopinion of my church, there's no justification for the death penalty.  If\r\nI-rendering some sort of verdict in phase two, the potential exists for the death\r\npenalty; I could not vote that way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>***</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tOkay.  But that based upon your religious feelings, that you would be very,\r\nvery compromised to be in this sort of a situation?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tThat's correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>***</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Judge: \tSir, let me ask you this question.  Can you return a verdict which assesses the\r\ndeath penalty in a case?  You understand you're never going to write \"death\r\npenalty.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tRight.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Judge: \tBut can you, in good conscience-and I don't care what your answer is.  I just\r\nneed to know.  Can you return a verdict which assesses a death penalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tI could not. \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State challenged Mr. Trzeciak for cause.  Appellant objected, arguing that Mr.\r\nTrzeciak said that he would answer the questions truthfully, despite his views on the death\r\npenalty.  The judge overruled the objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Appellant now argues that the State did not go far enough to disqualify Mr. Trzeciak\r\nbecause he never explicitly said that he would consciously distort answers to the special\r\nissues to prevent imposition of the death penalty.  But Mr. Trzeciak was clear that he could\r\nnot follow the law in answering the special issues and would be unable to return a verdict\r\nleading to the death penalty.  Although he stated that he would \"answer questions truthfully,\"\r\nhe also said that there was no set of circumstances under which the death penalty would be\r\njustified, based on his religious beliefs.  Furthermore, Mr. Trzeciak explicitly stated that he\r\ncould not return a death-penalty verdict.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record we cannot find that trial judge abused his discretion in granting the\r\nState's challenge for cause.  Mr. Trzeciak's answers concerning his inability to assess the\r\ndeath penalty under any circumstances were sufficient to support the trial judge's  conclusion\r\nthat he would be substantially impaired in his abilities as a juror.<sup> (27)</sup>  Accordingly, we overrule\r\nappellant's third point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>2.\tVeniremember Shaw</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fourth point of error, appellant contends that the trial judge erred in overruling\r\nhis <em>Batson</em><sup> (28)</sup> challenge to the State's peremptory strike of black veniremember Shaw.  A\r\ndefendant objecting under <em>Batson</em> must make a <em>prima facie</em> showing of racial discrimination\r\nin the State's exercise of its peremptory challenges.<sup> (29)</sup>  If the defendant makes a <em>prima facie\r\n</em>showing of discriminatory motives, the State then has the burden to produce a race-neutral\r\nexplanation.<sup> (30)</sup>  If the State articulates a race-neutral explanation, the burden remains with  the\r\ndefendant to show that the State's proffered reasons are mere pretexts for discrimination.<sup> (31)</sup> \r\nThe trial judge must then decide whether the defendant has proven purposeful\r\ndiscrimination.<sup> (32)</sup>  Because the trial judge's decision often turns largely on an evaluation of\r\ncredibility, we give the judge's ruling great deference and will not disturb it unless it is\r\nclearly erroneous.<sup> (33)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the defense objected under <em>Batson</em> to the State's use of a peremptory challenge\r\nagainst veniremember Shaw, the prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for her strike. \r\nThe prosecutor explained that she struck Ms. Shaw because she indicated, at least eight times\r\non her questionnaire, that she was personally against the death penalty.<sup> (34)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argued in response that the State spent nearly two hours questioning Shaw\r\nduring voir dire, which was the longest amount of time spent with any prospective juror\r\nbesides veniremember Lucas, also a black juror.  Appellant added that the prosecutor twice\r\nreferred to Ms. Shaw outside of the courtroom as an \"angry black female.\"  The prosecutor\r\nadmitted to using the term after questioning Ms. Shaw, but stated that neither that remark nor\r\nShaw's race had anything to do with the strike.  Regarding the two hours of questioning, the\r\nprosecutor explained that she had hoped to be able to challenge Ms. Shaw for cause because\r\nof her views about the death penalty in her questionnaire answers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the State offered race-neutral reasons for its strike and appellant failed to\r\nrebut those reasons, we hold that the trial judge did not clearly err in denying appellant's\r\n<em>Batson</em> challenge.<sup> (35)</sup>  Appellant's fourth point of error is overruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tThe Admission of Autopsy Photographs.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifth point of error, appellant argues that the trial judge erred by admitting\r\nhighly prejudicial and irrelevant autopsy photographs.  He specifically complains that the\r\nadmission of State's Exhibits 92-112 violated Texas Rule of Evidence 403, as well as the\r\ndue-course-of-law and due-process clauses of the Texas and U.S. Constitutions.  Because his\r\nonly argument deals with Rule 403, that is the only basis for exclusion that we will address.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder Rule 403, if the use of a photograph is helpful and \"relevant, legitimate, and\r\nlogical to the testimony that accompanies it,\" the trial judge may exclude it only if its\r\nemotional and prejudicial aspects substantially outweigh the helpful aspects.<sup> (36)</sup> In a Rule 403\r\nanalysis of autopsy photos, factors such as the \"number of exhibits offered, their\r\ngruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and white or color, whether they\r\nare close-up, whether the body is naked or clothed\" are appropriate for consideration.<sup> (37)</sup>  We\r\nreview the trial judge's Rule 403 ruling for an abuse of discretion.<sup> (38)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that these autopsy photographs had no probative value concerning\r\nany disputed fact because he did not contest the manner and cause of Amora's injuries or\r\ndeath.  Although he did not expressly contest the manner and cause of Amora's death,\r\nappellant did hold the State to its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt by\r\nconsistently challenging the rough-shod manner of the investigation and handling of physical\r\nevidence.  He also challenged the assertion that most of the injuries were inflicted before\r\nAmora's death.  Moreover, the State had the burden of proving that appellant intentionally\r\nor knowingly murdered the infant, \"and the photographic representation of the injuries tends\r\nto establish this element in a way which testimony by witnesses could not as accurately\r\nportray.\"<sup> (39)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe autopsy photographs admitted-only twenty of the some 300 autopsy photos-were\r\npersonally selected by the medical examiner, Dr. Keith Pinckard, to best illustrate his\r\ntestimony.<sup> (40)</sup>  The color photographs were displayed on a projector.   Multiple photographs\r\nwere necessary because multiple injuries were inflicted.  Dr. Pinckard testified that, even\r\nafter the autopsy, he could not tell exactly which injury caused death.  Rather</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tthere were many injuries present, and there was also, as I indicated, the pretty\r\ngood possibility that strangulation was also involved.  So we have the\r\npossibility for strangulation.  We have a head injury that could easily cause\r\ndeath.  We have a liver injury that might cause death, although there wasn't a\r\nwhole lot of bleeding, so maybe not here.  And then, of course, we have a\r\nnumber of injuries to-just the bruising itself was so extensive on the body, you\r\ncan actually experience effects just from the amount of bleeding that occurs\r\ninto the tissue.  So rather than anything specific, we certified the cause of death\r\nas homicidal violence, because it was obviously inflicted, including multiple\r\nblunt force injuries and possible strangulations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The autopsy photographs were probative of the fact that this was a cruel and deliberate\r\nkilling-with multiple injuries inflicted ante-mortem, rather than post-mortem.  These \r\nphotographs, which simply showed the number and type of injuries Amora suffered, could\r\nadd little to improperly inflame or prejudice the jury.  The trial judge did not abuse his\r\ndiscretion in admitting the autopsy photographs.<sup> (41)</sup>  We overrule appellant's fifth point of\r\nerror. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tCrime Lab Accreditation-Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.35</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixth point of error, appellant argues that the trial judge abused his discretion\r\nin admitting the testimony of Dr. Robert Williams, a forensic odontologist, in violation of\r\nArticle 38.35-which makes the admissibility of some forensic evidence contingent on\r\nwhether the analysis of the evidence was conducted at an accredited laboratory.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tArticle 38.35(d) provides, in relevant part, that </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\ta forensic analysis of physical evidence under this article and expert testimony\r\nrelating to the evidence are not admissible in a criminal action if, at the time\r\nof the analysis, the crime laboratory conducting the analysis was not accredited\r\nby the director under Section 411.0205, Government Code.<sup> (42)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Subsection (d) was added to Article 38.35 in 2003, in response to problems with the DNA\r\nevidence testing and examination operations in the Houston Police Department Crime Lab.<sup> (43)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore Dr. Williams testified, a hearing was held, outside the jury's presence, on\r\nappellant's Article 38.35 challenge.  Appellant did not dispute that Dr. Williams is the chief\r\nforensic odontologist for SWIFS<sup> (44)</sup> or that SWIFS is an accredited crime lab.  His objection\r\nwas two-fold.  First, appellant alleged that Dr. Williams's work in this case was done as part\r\nof his private dental practice, rather than for SWIFS. Second, SWIFS, although accredited\r\nthrough ASCLD/LAB-L<sup> (45)</sup> for various scientific disciplines, was not certified for odontology. \r\nThe trial judge overruled appellant's objections, but gave him a running objection to all of\r\nDr. Williams's testimony. We review that ruling for an abuse of discretion.<sup> (46)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, the record supports the trial judge's implicit finding that Dr. Williams conducted\r\nthis analysis for SWIFS.  The medical examiner testified that, because it was \"incredibly\r\nobvious\" that the baby was covered in human bite marks, he called in Dr. Williams \"so that\r\nhe would he able to take his own photographs.\"  Dr. Williams testified that he is an\r\nindependent contractor for SWIFS.  He said that he was called to the autopsy suite at SWIFS\r\nby Dr. Pinckard, the medical examiner.  When he gets such a call, he winds up the work in\r\nhis own practice \"immediately\" and then heads for the Medical Examiner's Office.  Dr.\r\nWilliams explained that he works as an independent contractor for a number of labs because\r\nmost medical examiner offices \"do not have the budget to be able to pay someone a full-time\r\nsalary[.]\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, SWIFS, according to Defense Exhibit 9 (\"Current List of DPS Accredited\r\nLabs from Texas, 8/6/2009\"), was one of eight accredited labs, and in fact the most\r\nextensively \"accredited\" of the eight.<sup> (47)</sup>  Article 38.35 does not specify that the crime\r\nlaboratory must be certified in the exact discipline that is the subject of the testimony.<sup> (48)</sup> And\r\nodontology is not one of the disciplines for which accreditation is available.<sup> (49)</sup>  Nevertheless,\r\nodontology is a species of impression evidence, and Chapter 37, Section 28.145(d) of the\r\nTexas Administrative Code provides that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tthe subdiscipline of impression evidence, including footwear, tiretrack, and\r\nsimilar impression evidence, may be administratively assigned by the\r\nlaboratory to its trace evidence section, firearms section, or questioned\r\ndocument section. The director deems impression evidence to be a\r\nsubdiscipline of several disciplines under this subchapter, including trace\r\nevidence, firearms/toolmark, or questioned documents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>SWIFS was, as the prosecutor pointed out to the trial judge, accredited in the trace-evidence\r\nand firearms/toolmark disciplines.  Given this record, we conclude that the trial judge did not\r\nabuse his discretion in overruling appellant's objection to Dr. Williams's testimony.<sup> (50)</sup>  We\r\noverrule point of error six.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>E.\tFuture Dangerousness.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his seventh point of error, appellant argues that the evidence is legally insufficient\r\nto support the jury's affirmative answer to the \"future-dangerousness\" special issue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA jury may consider a variety of factors when determining whether a defendant will</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>pose a continuing threat to society.<sup> (51)</sup> The facts of the offense alone may suffice to support\r\nthe jury's finding of future dangerousness.<sup> (52)</sup>  We view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the jury's finding and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\r\nfound, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there is a probability that appellant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.<sup> (53)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe circumstances of Amora's murder are, by themselves, sufficient to sustain the\r\njury's finding of future dangerousness.  Appellant savagely beat, bit, strangled, and sexually\r\nmutilated the thirteen-month old daughter of his girlfriend-either alone or with her.  Dr.\r\nPinckard testified that this was \"not a quick event\" because of the number of injuries that are\r\n\"clearly antemortem.\"  He agreed that \"anyone who would inflict these injuries on Amora\r\nwould have had to have known that death was reasonably certain to be the result.\"  Dr.\r\nPinckard testified that he had never-in his decades of experience-seen a  more severe case\r\nof child abuse.   Evidence that a murder was committed with deliberation and forethought\r\nmay be sufficient for a finding of future dangerousness.<sup> (54)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence of a defendant's prior criminal record may also serve as the basis for a\r\nfinding of future dangerousness, and this jury was presented with evidence of appellant's\r\nprior solicitation of aggravated sexual assault of his eleven-year-old neighbor.<sup> (55)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts that the future-dangerousness special issue requires the jury to\r\ndetermine whether a capital defendant would be a continuing threat to prison society.  And\r\nunder this \"future danger test of <em>Berry</em> [<em>v. State</em>, 233 S.W.3d 847 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007],\"\r\nthe \"State has failed to prove that [appellant], unless executed, would ever pose the threat of\r\ncriminal violence he posed in this case-danger to a child.\"  That is, if appellant were allowed\r\nto live, he would spend the rest of his life in prison and therefore never have the opportunity\r\nto hurt a child again.  Appellant acknowledges that in <em>Estrada v. State</em> and <em>Coble v. State</em>, we\r\ninterpreted the future-dangerousness special issue to ask whether a defendant would be a\r\ncontinuing threat \"whether in or out of prison.\"<sup> (56)</sup> Appellant asserts that the <em>Coble-Estrada</em>\r\nconstruction of the future-danger test permits consideration of hypothetical predictions and\r\nis inconsistent with the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Jurek v. Texas</em>,<sup> (57)</sup> which interpreted the\r\nTexas statute as \"requiring a literal prediction of future criminal conduct made to further the\r\ngoal of incapacitation.\"<sup> (58)</sup>  He argues, \"Keeping faith with <em>Jurek</em>, this Court should here apply\r\nthe future danger test of <em>Berry</em> which considers the restraints inherent in the alternative\r\nsentence to death.\"<sup> (59)</sup>  We have rejected this argument.<sup> (60)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, the State's case for future dangerousness was not \"child-specific.\"  The jury\r\nheard about appellant's escalating pattern of violence.  He settled his scores with adults with\r\nviolence-he \"caught a guy in his apartment, and he commenced to whupping his ass.\"   He\r\n\"took care of\" a guy he found with his niece.  He fought with his brother because he was\r\ntired of arguing about cigarette smoke: \"I was tired of arguing with him, and I wasn't going\r\nto argue with him, so I hit him in the mouth.\" Deputy Clark-who investigated the\r\nfight-testified that appellant's mother asked him, \"What can be done about Blaine?\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShe said that his temper had progressed from the years. She said that he had\r\nbegan with becoming upset and showing anger through his emotions, and she\r\nsaid he went from that to verbal abuse. She said over the years he went to\r\nphysical abuse, and she said that it's been ongoing and uncontrollable. She\r\nsaid this is just getting to the point where she couldn't control it, and now [his]\r\nbrother is getting to where he can't control it. And she asked me what can be\r\ndone about his--about his actions . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAnd this case is distinguishable from <em>Berry</em> for yet another reason: The jury heard that\r\nappellant, while he was in Rusk County jail, told another inmate of his plan to escape.  \"He\r\nsaid his brother was going to have a bomb threat put on the jail, so that everybody in K Tank\r\nwould get let out.\"  He was then going to escape to Mexico.  Appellant ended up threatening\r\nthis inmate after they got in to an argument, saying \"if I kept messing with him, I would wake\r\nup with a pencil in my side.\"  Because he feared retaliation, the inmate never reported the\r\nthreat until appellant was moved from K Tank.  Appellant's pattern of violence did not\r\ndiminish, even in jail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving viewed all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's finding, we\r\nconclude that a rational jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, a probability that\r\nappellant would pose a continuing threat to society.<sup> (61)</sup> Point of error seven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>F.\tRacial Prejudice.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his eighth point of error, appellant argues that the trial judge erred, in the\r\npunishment phase, in admitting evidence of appellant's father's racial prejudice.  Appellant's\r\nfriend, Chris Lay, testified about the end of appellant's schooling in the fourth grade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A. \tEducationally [he was slow], because, I mean, he got pulled out of school in the\r\nfourth grade because people picking on him, you know. His dad got tired of it and\r\nsaid he didn't want him in school no more, if everybody was going to mess with him\r\nlike that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>On cross-examination, the prosecutor revisited appellant's exit from school:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \tAnd you've-you visited with Missy, our investigator, over the weekend, right? . . .\r\nAnd you told her that part of the reason why he got pulled out of school was because\r\nhis dad was upset because his principal was black.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tWell, he was upset because-yeah, that, too.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The trial judge overruled appellant's Rule 403 objection.  Outside the presence of the jury,\r\nthe prosecutor explained that she presented the evidence to refute the false impression that\r\nMr. Lay had given to the jury.<sup> (62)</sup>  Defense counsel pointed out that the jury already knew,\r\nfrom previous testimony, that appellant was pulled from school after the paddling and that\r\nthis was</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tnothing more than a direct appeal to that jury for unfair prejudice against him\r\nthrough his father. It's not like this man had any belief like this. We're talking\r\nabout a child who was in the fourth grade. And they want to bring in the fact\r\nthe father pulled him out because the principal was black? And I believe what\r\nthe witness testified to is he was pulled out because he was paddled, which\r\nwas not a false impression, because that's exactly what the jury was told. It\r\njust-you noted it for the record. You've done-you've made your ruling, and\r\nI've had my say. Fine. Move again for a mistrial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge overruled the motion for mistrial, but gave the jury the following\r\nlimiting instruction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLadies and gentlemen, the Court overlooked this prior to beginning the\r\ntestimony of this witness. I want to instruct you concerning some prior\r\ntestimony this morning. You're not to hold any alleged racial statements\r\nallegedly made by this defendant's father against this defendant, or infer that\r\nthis statement or these statements are or is the belief or view of this defendant,\r\nand any racial content of any alleged statement is not to be inferred upon this\r\ndefendant. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant now argues that \"it was irrelevant that the principal who paddled Milam,\r\ncausing his father to take him out of school, was African-American.\"<sup> (63)</sup>  The State counters\r\nthat the evidence was relevant to impeach Mr. Lay and \"to counter the assertion that the sole\r\nreason Appellant was removed from school was because he was unfairly picked on.\"<sup> (64)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial judge's relevancy rulings will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.<sup> (65)</sup>\r\nAppellant relies on <em>Bell v. State</em>, in which the Beaumont Court of Appeals held that it was\r\nreversible error for the State to elicit testimony, at the punishment stage, from the defendant's\r\nmother about racially charged comments she overheard after her son was found guilty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe fact that Ms. Bell may have heard the jury or the prosecutor referred to as\r\n\"prejudiced\" or \"redneck,\" or that she heard someone comment that the verdict\r\nwas unfair because of the fact that the appellant was Black and the jury was\r\nentirely white, without having first connected the source of said comments to\r\nappellant's family or friends, was simply irrelevant as to any issue regarding\r\nappellant.<sup> (66)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOne critical difference between <em>Bell</em> and this case is that in <em>Bell</em>, it was the jury itself\r\nthat was accused of being racist.<sup> (67)</sup> Further, in this case, the trial judge instructed the jury not\r\nto hold appellant's father's possible racism against appellant. There is no indication that the\r\njury disregarded the trial judge's instruction, and we must presume that it followed those\r\ninstructions.<sup> (68)</sup>  Point of error eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>G.\tExamining Experts: <em>Lagrone</em>.</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's ninth, tenth, and eleventh points of error address the trial judge's ruling,\r\nmade at appellant's request, that the experts interviewing appellant be prohibited from asking\r\nhim about the facts of Amora's murder.  Specifically, appellant argues that the State's\r\nquestioning of both the defense and State's experts about that prohibition violated appellant's\r\nright to remain silent (point nine), constituted prosecutorial misconduct (point ten), and\r\ndeliberately deceived the jury (point eleven).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>1.\t<em>Soria</em> / <em>Lagrone</em> / <em>Chamberlain</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn<em> Soria v. State</em>,<sup> (69)</sup> we recognized that a defendant may \"waive\" his Fifth Amendment\r\nrights to a limited extent by presenting psychiatric testimony.   We held that </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\twhen the defendant initiates a psychiatric examination and based thereon\r\npresents psychiatric testimony on the issue of future dangerousness, the trial\r\ncourt may compel an examination of appellant by an expert of the State's or\r\ncourt's choosing and the State may present rebuttal testimony of that expert\r\nbased upon his examination of the defendant; provided, however, that the\r\nrebuttal testimony is limited to the issues raised by the defense expert.<sup> (70)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Lagrone v. State</em>, we expanded the scope of the rule to allow trial judges to order\r\ncriminal defendants to submit to a state-sponsored psychiatric exam on future dangerousness\r\nwhen the defense introduces, or <em>plans to introduce,</em> its own future-dangerousness expert\r\ntestimony based upon a psychiatric examination.<sup> (71)</sup> In <em>Chamberlain v. State</em>, we held the rule\r\napplicable even if the appellant introduces the evidence only in rebuttal.<sup> (72)</sup>  We noted that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<em>Soria</em> and <em>Lagrone </em>are governed by the principle that if a defendant breaks his\r\nsilence to speak to his own psychiatric expert and introduces that testimony\r\nwhich is based on such interview, he has constructively taken the stand and\r\nwaived his fifth amendment right to refuse to submit to the State's psychiatric\r\nexperts. The focus is the defendant's choice to break his silence.<sup> (73)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith this background, we turn to the relevant facts.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>2.\tRelevant Facts</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore trial, the State filed a motion for a psychological evaluation of appellant to\r\nrebut appellant's psychological testimony.  The trial judge conducted a pretrial hearing on\r\nthe motion during which the defense asked that the State's expert be prohibited from asking\r\nappellant questions about the facts of the crime.  The defense said that it had not let its own\r\nexperts talk to appellant about the crime, and that none of them \"have used any information\r\nthat they gained through him concerning the offense in forming any opinions.\"  The defense\r\nopposed inquiry into the facts on a number of grounds, including the Fifth Amendment right\r\nto remain silent.  The State objected, arguing that once a defendant waives his right to remain\r\nsilent by talking to experts, he cannot dictate the questions that he is asked.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRelying on the language contained in <em>Chamberlain</em>, that \"the essential principles at\r\nwork in<em> Lagrone </em>and <em>Soria</em> are waiver and parity,\"<sup> (74)</sup> the trial judge agreed to limit\r\nexamination to exclude any discussion of the facts of the crime by both parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAll right. The Court has reviewed the cases submitted to it, and the Court-and\r\nprimarily based upon language contained in <em>Chamberlain</em>, I am going to limit\r\nthe interview to exclude the offense, with the understanding that defendant's\r\nexperts will be precluded from offering any . . . findings, conclusions, or\r\nopinions based upon any interview or conversations of the defendant, by the\r\nexpert of the defendant, concerning the offense itself. And, of course, this does\r\nnot preclude any opinions, findings, or conclusions obtained from sources\r\nother than the defendant. Anything further?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, Dr. Cunningham, the defense expert, testified that appellant's mental\r\ndeficiency is sufficiently severe for him to meet the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation. \r\nHe also testified that appellant had psychotic symptoms related to his methamphetamine\r\nabuse, and that \"given the extent of methamphetamine that he was using prior to the crime,\r\nit's very likely that he may have been delusional. It may have induced a psychotic state that\r\nlooked similar to schizophrenia. He may have actually had some hallucinations.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross-examination by the prosecutor, the following exchange took place:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\t. . . When you interviewed the defendant in those 9 hours that you spent with him, you\r\ndid not ask him one thing about the capital murder for which this jury has convicted\r\nhim, did you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tThat's correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q.\tWhy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tWell, primarily because I was instructed by Counsel not to go into the circumstances,\r\nthe events of the offense itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q.\tReally?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tYes, ma'am.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel then renewed the Fifth Amendment objection he had made at the\r\npretrial hearing. The State responded, \"He didn't remain silent. He waived his right to remain\r\nsilent, and in talking to the expert, he-there is no such thing as a partial waiver. . . . I have\r\nevery right to ask him about that, because it's-once he waives, he waives.\"  The trial judge\r\noverruled the objection, but granted appellant's running objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe prosecutor resumed cross-examination and later asked,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tOkay. Well, I'll come back to that. But you do talk to capital murderers about the facts\r\nof the capital murder they've been convicted of.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tInfrequently. Most of the time I do not. Most of the time defense counsels do not\r\nauthorize a discussion about the capital offense. The defendant retains a Fifth\r\nAmendment right to not incriminate himself, even for an evaluation that's being\r\nperformed for sentencing purposes . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>In rebuttal, the State called Dr. Tim Proctor, and questioned him as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tOkay. Now, you've told us that you spent a significant amount of time interviewing\r\nthe defendant?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q.\tWere you permitted to talk to this defendant, Blaine Milam, about the facts of the\r\ncapital murder case for which he has been convicted?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The trial judge overruled appellant's running objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tDr. Proctor, were you able to speak with the defendant about the facts of the capital\r\nmurder case for which he was convicted by this jury?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tNo.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Later, the prosecutor asked Dr. Proctor about Dr. Cunningham's opinion that appellant might\r\nhave been delusional.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tIn your field as a psychologist, as a forensic psychologist, is it appropriate to diagnose\r\nsomeone or to opine that someone is psychotic or delusional without having talked to\r\nthem?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tWell, I think the best way for me to answer that is to tell you what I would do and\r\nwhat I would teach my students. And I believe that to make an assertion about what\r\nsomeone's mental state was like at the time of some offense, you have to have talked\r\nto them about that to have a meaningful opinion about that. And without doing that,\r\nI don't know how you can know, especially in the absence of some other piece of\r\nevidence where the person at issue has given a recitation of what happened.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>3.\tPoints of Error Nine, Ten, and Eleven</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues in his ninth point of error that the trial judge erred in allowing the\r\nabove questioning in violation of \"the spirit, if not the letter\" of the trial judge's previous\r\norder and of appellant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  In his tenth point of error,\r\nappellant argues that the State's conduct-in exposing the fact that the experts did not talk to\r\nappellant about the facts of the crime-constituted prosecutorial misconduct.  That misconduct\r\n(1) violated his Fifth Amendment right to be free of harm for exercising his right to remain\r\nsilent about the facts of his case,<sup> (75)</sup> and (2) unfairly left \"the jury with the impression that\r\nAppellant, on advice of counsel, was attempting to hide important information that bore on\r\nthe issue.\"<sup> (76)</sup>  In his eleventh point of error, appellant asserts that leaving this\r\nimpression-when it was actually the trial judge's ruling to prohibit the experts from inquiring\r\nabout the facts of the case-amounted to <em>Napue v. Illinois</em><sup> (77)</sup> or \"false testimony\" error because\r\nit discredited appellant and \"undermined his case for mental retardation.\"<sup> (78)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, the trial judge did not err.  This line of questioning did not violate his pretrial\r\norder:  That order limited only the questioning of appellant, not the questioning of testifying\r\nexperts. And the questioning did not violate appellant's Fifth Amendment right to remain\r\nsilent.  Appellant broke his silence to speak to his own psychiatric expert and introduced\r\ntestimony based on that interview, so he constructively took the stand, and waived the Fifth\r\nAmendment \"in the same manner as would his election to testify at trial.\"<sup> (79)</sup> The State was\r\nthen entitled to offer rebuttal testimony limited to the issues raised by the defense expert. It\r\nwas permissible for the State to test Dr. Cunningham's opinions by questioning him (and Dr.\r\nProctor) about how Dr. Cunningham arrived at those opinions.<sup> (80)</sup>  Appellant may not testify\r\nthrough a defense expert and then use the Fifth Amendment as a shield against\r\ncross-examination of that expert on disputed issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, there was no misconduct.  The State did not leave a false impression \"that\r\nMilam refused to speak about the facts of the offense, rather than it being the trial court's\r\ndecision that the experts not inquire about the facts of the offense.\"<sup> (81)</sup>  The trial judge limited\r\ninquiry by the experts into the facts of the crime solely at appellant's behest.  Appellant chose\r\nnot to discuss the crime facts with his expert,  and the trial judge entered an order limiting\r\nthese expert examinations only because of appellant's request.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThird, there was no false testimony.  Dr. Cunningham testified he was instructed by\r\ncounsel not to inquire into the facts of the case, and Dr. Proctor testified that he was not able\r\nto speak with the defendant about the facts of the case.<sup> (82)</sup>  These were true assertions.  They\r\ndo not conflict with appellant's request to the trial judge and the trial judge's order based on\r\nthat request.<sup> (83)</sup>  Appellant's points of error nine through eleven are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>H.\tState's Punishment-Stage Closing Argument.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twelfth point of error, appellant argues that two portions of the State's closing\r\nargument violated his Eighth Amendment right to have the jury consider and give effect to\r\nhis mitigating evidence, and so denied him his right to a fair trial and reliable sentencing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere are four proper areas of jury argument: (1) summation of the evidence presented\r\nat trial; (2) reasonable deduction drawn from that evidence; (3) answer to the opposing\r\ncounsel's argument; or (4) a plea for law enforcement.<sup> (84)</sup>  Any appellate claim that a\r\nprosecution argument strayed outside the bounds of these categories is forfeited if there was\r\nno contemporaneous trial objection.<sup> (85)</sup>  If there was a contemporaneous trial objection to\r\nimproper jury argument, such argument does not result in reversal \"unless, in light of the\r\nrecord as a whole, the argument is extreme or manifestly improper, violative of a mandatory\r\nstatute, or injects new facts harmful to the accused into the trial proceeding.\"<sup> (86)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant complains about two arguments.  First, appellant asserts that the prosecutor\r\nmisstated the law on mitigation, misstated the special issue, and prevented the jury from\r\ngiving effect to appellant's mitigating evidence, when she argued-over a running\r\nobjection-that only evidence of appellant's being abused as a child could justify a life\r\nsentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMitigating evidence is that which lessens a person's moral blameworthiness\r\nfor what he's done. And yes, you have heard evidence from his background\r\nthat is unfortunate. You have heard things that I can agree was not the perfect\r\nlife growing up; however, the problem is, the fundamental problem is that the\r\none type of mitigating evidence that could explain this, that I would suggest\r\nto you might be sufficient to explain this act and this conduct and this crime,\r\nis not here. If there was evidence before you that this defendant had been\r\nhorribly abused as a child, horribly abused as a child, I could stand before you</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>***</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[objection overruled]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThank you, Your Honor. If he had been somehow horribly abused as a child,\r\nbitten, beaten, violated, perhaps that would be mitigating evidence that would\r\nlessen his moral blameworthiness sufficiently to warrant life. Folks, that's not\r\nhere. As much-as much as the Milam family did not do right over the years,\r\nthey did not abuse their kids, and nobody else did either. That's not here.\r\nThat's the bottom line, and I would suggest to you that really is the only kind\r\nof mitigating evidence that truly can explain why we're here and truly lessen\r\nmoral blameworthiness for this. I would ask you, when you're looking at the\r\nmitigating evidence, to go back to that life-altering moment when you first saw\r\nand you first realized what he did to Amora, everything he did to Amora, and\r\nask yourself what could possibly mitigate that? That is the bottom line where\r\nthe fourth question is concerned. The answer to the fourth question is \"No.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe prosecutor did not misstate the law on mitigation or the mitigation special issue. \r\nArticle 37.071(f) provides that the jury \"shall consider mitigating evidence to be evidence\r\nthat a juror might regard as reducing the defendant's moral blameworthiness.\"<sup> (87)</sup>   Nor did the\r\nprosecutor prevent the jury from giving effect to appellant's mitigating evidence.  The\r\nargument was a fair rebuttal to defense counsel's argument that appellant </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tis the reason for this system. He's the reason why we don't say, 'Guilty, death\r\npenalty'. . . . How many mitigating factors are there? In fact, I think I have like\r\nthree pages written down here of factors through this kid's life that could be\r\nmitigating and need to be considered . . . . That's why we don't let the mob\r\nmentality decide these cases, because everything that you've heard mitigates\r\nagainst giving this boy death.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>For these reasons, we find nothing in the prosecutor's remarks to reflect that she was asking\r\nthe jury to forgo its duty and automatically answer the special issues in such a way that\r\nappellant would receive the death penalty.<sup> (88)</sup> The trial judge did not err in overruling\r\nappellant's objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, appellant complains that the prosecutor violated his right to a reliable\r\nsentencing determination by falsely arguing that the jury had no choice but to assess death: \r\n\"Sometimes the death penalty is society's last line of self-defense. . . . He has earned it, and\r\nyou know it's the only choice.\"  Appellant did not contemporaneously object to this closing\r\nargument, and therefore he has forfeited any complaint on appeal about it.<sup> (89)</sup> We overrule\r\nappellant's twelfth point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tConstitutional Challenges to the Texas Death Penalty Statute.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's remaining points of error are constitutional challenges to the Texas death-penalty statute.  Appellant candidly acknowledges that all of these challenges have previously\r\nbeen rejected by this Court. Appellant invites us to review our prior positions.  We decline\r\nto do so and briefly answer each claim by citing the controlling authority.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirteenth point, appellant challenges the \"10-12\" rule, arguing that it violates\r\nhis rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it leaves jurors in the dark\r\nabout the fact that their failure to unanimously agree on an answer to either special issue\r\nresults in a life sentence.  This Court has rejected these challenges.<sup> (90)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fourteenth point, appellant claims that the trial judge committed reversible error\r\nby charging the jurors that they had discretion to decide whether a particular circumstance\r\nwas mitigating.  Consistent with Article 37.071, §(2)(f)(4), the trial judge charged the jury\r\nthat it \"shall consider mitigating evidence to be evidence that a juror might regard as\r\nreducing the</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>defendant's moral blameworthiness.\" Appellant argues that the statute violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment, \"which permits jurors no such discretion.\"  We have rejected this claim.<sup> (91)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifteenth point, appellant argues that the trial judge's failure to define\r\n\"probability,\" \"criminal acts of violence,\" or \"continuing threat to society\" violated the\r\nconstitutional requirement that each statutory aggravating circumstance genuinely narrows\r\nthe class of persons eligible for the death penalty.  We have repeatedly held that the trial\r\njudge need not define such terms because we presume that the jury understands them.<sup> (92)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixteenth point, appellant argues that the State's unfettered, standardless, and\r\nunreviewable discretion to seek the death penalty violates his rights under the Equal\r\nProtection and Due Process Clauses and results in cruel and unusual punishment.  We have\r\nrepeatedly rejected these contentions.<sup> (93)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his seventeenth point, appellant argues that the Texas death-penalty scheme violates\r\ndue process because the mitigation special issue fails to require the State to prove the absence\r\nof mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, contrary to the <em>Apprendi</em> line of\r\ncases.  And in his eighteenth point, he argues that the scheme violates due course of law and\r\nresults in cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Texas Constitution because of the\r\n\"impossibility of simultaneously restricting the jury's discretion to impose the death penalty\r\nwhile also allowing the jury unlimited discretion to consider all evidence militating against\r\nimposition of the death penalty.\"   We have rejected these claims.<sup> (94)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points nineteen and twenty, appellant contends that the cumulative effect of these\r\nconstitutional and statutory infringements violates the state and federal constitutions.  Having\r\nfound no such violations, we hold that these claims are without merit.<sup> (95)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving overruled appellant's points of error, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Delivered: May 23, 2012</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Do Not Publish\r\n<p>1.

Dr. Cunnningham said that he was aware of the Kenneth McDade incident but, \"[i]t did\r\nnot represent an assault.\"  He said that, in custody, \"individuals may puff up.

On May 17, 2010, a jury found him guilty, and,\r\nafter a separate punishment hearing, the jury answered the future-dangerousness special issue\r\n\"yes,\" the anti-parties special issue \"yes,\" the mental-retardation special issue \"no,\" and the\r\nmitigation special issue \"no.\"<sup> (2)</sup> The trial judge set appellant's punishment at death.<sup> (3)</sup> Direct\r\nappeal to this Court is automatic.<sup> (4)</sup>  After reviewing appellant's twenty points of error, we find\r\nthem to be without merit and affirm the conviction and death sentence.  We note at the outset\r\nthat appellant challenges neither the sufficiency of the evidence to support the guilty verdict\r\nnor the determination that appellant is not mentally retarded. Because appellant does\r\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the future-dangerousness special issue,\r\nwe set out, at some length, the facts of the crime and relevant punishment evidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A. \tThe State's Guilt-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt 10:37 a.m. on December 2, 2008,  appellant called 911, and the first thing he said\r\nwas, \"My name is Blaine Milam, and my daughter, I just found her dead.\"   Rusk County\r\nPatrol Sergeant Kevin Roy arrived at appellant's trailer home outside Tatum twenty minutes\r\nlater.  Two ambulances were already there.  EMTs were standing in the doorway of the\r\nmaster bedroom, where appellant and Jesseca Carson were kneeling on the floor.  Sgt. Roy\r\nsaw \"an infant laying on the floor not moving, not breathing, bruised. The baby was laying\r\non its back, and the face of the baby was just one large bruise.\"  He thought that the circular\r\nbruises he saw on the child's body were caused by a Coke can.  He did not recognize them\r\nas human bite marks.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter lead investigator Sergeant Amber Rogers arrived, Sgt. Roy took appellant aside\r\nto talk while Sgt. Rogers talked to Jesseca.  Appellant told Sgt. Roy that he and Jesseca had\r\nleft Amora alone in the trailer and walked up the road to meet a man named Clark who was\r\ngoing to clear some land for him.  They were gone about an hour, and, when they came back,\r\nthey found \"the baby in that condition.\"  Appellant was calm, collected, and cooperative.\r\nAfter the interviews, Sgt. Roy read the pair their <em>Miranda</em> rights.  He told them that, when\r\nthe crime-scene investigation was done, they would be taken to the Sheriff's office for more\r\nquestioning and collection of their clothes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShortly thereafter, Kenny Ray, a Texas Ranger, arrived and noticed Jesseca and\r\nappellant embracing.  To Ranger Ray, the two looked like \"grieving parents,\" not suspects. \r\nRanger Ray conducted an hour-long interview with appellant in the front seat of his patrol\r\ncar.  Appellant told the ranger that authorities were \"more than welcome\" to search his car\r\nand home.  Appellant denied involvement in Amora's death.  He also gave Ranger Ray\r\nnames of possible suspects and said that whoever did this should \"be hung.\"  In that recorded\r\ninterview, appellant explained that Jesseca was his fiancee and that Amora was Jesseca's\r\nchild, but that they both lived with him and he was \"raising that baby.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant then told Ranger Ray the same story that he had told Sgt. Roy.  He added\r\nthat, when he and Jesseca got home, they found Amora, not in her crib, but in a hole in the\r\nfloor in the bathroom that he was remodeling.  Appellant said Amora had a blood ring around\r\nher mouth, and \"it looked like she had been biting the insulation.\"  She was still breathing,\r\nso they called 911.  Appellant later told Ranger Ray that Jesseca called 911 before they found\r\nAmora, and that when they found her, she was dead.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRanger Ray's tone eventually became accusatory.  He told appellant that he knew he\r\nwas lying, that no one would believe his story, and that everyone would think he had beat the\r\nbaby because he was the only male in the house. Appellant again denied any involvement \r\nin Amora's death  and offered to take a polygraph test.  Finally, Ranger Ray told appellant\r\nthat he was free to go, meaning that he was free to get out of the patrol car, but not to leave\r\nthe scene.  By then, Ranger Ray considered appellant a suspect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe ranger also interviewed Jesseca. At first she \"was crying and acting very\r\ndistraught,\" but then there was a \"pretty drastic\" change in her demeanor.  She referred to\r\nAmora  as \"that baby\" and told Ranger Ray an \"extremely bizarre story.\"<sup> (5)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe medical examiner gave Amora's cause of death as homicidal violence, due to\r\nmultiple blunt-force injuries and possible strangulation.  He detailed her injuries: facial\r\nabrasions and bruises; twenty-four human bite marks; bruises, scrapes, and abrasions from\r\nhead to toe; bleeding underneath the scalp; extensive fracturing to the back of the skull;\r\nbleeding between the brain and the skull; a laceration to the brain tissue as well as swelling,\r\nbleeding, and bruising; bleeding around the optic nerves; bleeding in the eyes and around the\r\njugular vein; fractures to the right arm and leg; eighteen rib fractures; a tear to the liver; and\r\nextensive injury to the genitals. There were no old injuries suggesting a pattern of abuse.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe investigation quickly poked holes in appellant's story. Shane and Dwight Clark,\r\nof Clark Timber, denied any meeting with appellant on December 2nd.  Crystal Dopson,\r\nmanager of the Insta-Cash Pawn Shop in Henderson, said that, shortly after she opened the\r\nshop on December 2nd, Jesseca and appellant came in and pawned an electric chain saw and\r\nan air impact tool. Surveillance video showed the two in the pawn shop for about fifteen\r\nminutes.  Surveillance video from the Exxon in Henderson picked them up shortly thereafter.\r\nAlso, appellant had called his sister, Teresa Shea, that morning before 9:30 a.m., crying and\r\nsaying that he had \"found Amora dead.\" Teresa told him to call 911, but appellant did not do\r\nso until 10:37 a.m.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 11th, investigators conducted  a second search of appellant's trailer and\r\ndetermined that the south end of the trailer, rather than the master bedroom, was probably the\r\ncrime scene.  They found blood-spatter stains, consistent with blunt force trauma, near the\r\nsouth bedroom.  Among the items collected from the south bedroom were:  blood-stained\r\nbedding and baby clothes; blood-stained baby diapers and wipes; a tube of Astroglide\r\nlubricant; and a pair of jeans with blood stains on the lap.  DNA testing later showed that\r\nAmora's blood was on these items.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn December 13th, appellant's sister, Teresa, went to see appellant in jail.  That night,\r\nshe told her aunt that she \"was needing to find a way to get back out to the trailer in Tatum\"\r\nbecause \"Blaine had told her that she needed to go out there to the trailer to get some\r\nevidence out from underneath of it.\"  The aunt called Sgt. Rogers and told her that \"she\r\nneeded to get out to the trailer immediately, that Teresa was wanting to go out there to get\r\nsome evidence out from underneath the trailer.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSgt. Rogers immediately obtained a search warrant, crawled under the trailer, and\r\ndiscovered a pipe wrench inside a clear plastic bag.  The pipe wrench had been shoved down\r\n\"a hole in the floor of the master bathroom.\"  Forensic analysis revealed components of\r\nAstroglide on the pipe wrench, the diaper Amora had been wearing, and the diaper and wipes\r\ncollected from the south bedroom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Robert Williams, a forensic odontologist, compared the bite marks found on\r\nAmora's body with bite dentition models obtained from appellant, Jesseca, and appellant's\r\nbrother Danny Milam. Dr. Williams testified that, to \"a reasonable degree of dental\r\ncertainty,\" appellant's dentition matched eight bite marks on Amora.  He could exclude\r\nJesseca from all but one of the bite marks, and he could exclude Danny from all of the bite\r\nmarks.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShirley Broyles, the nurse at the Rusk County Jail, testified that appellant called for\r\nher one day in January.  She found him crying in his cell. He handed her a written request to\r\ntalk to Sgt. Rogers, and told Ms. Broyles: \"I'm going to confess.  I did it.  But Ms. Shirley,\r\nthe Blaine you know did not do this.  My dad told me to be a man, and I've been reading my\r\nBible.  Please tell Jesseca I love her.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>B. \tThe Defense Guilt-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's defense focused on Jesseca as the murderer.  The defense called Heather\r\nCarson, Jesseca's mother, who said that Jesseca and appellant starting dating around January\r\n2008 and got engaged a few months later.  Jesseca moved in with appellant and his parents\r\nthat spring.  When Jesseca turned eighteen, she received an insurance settlement from her\r\nfather's 2001 death.  Heather noticed an immediate change in Jesseca; she became \r\nwithdrawn and stopped caring about her appearance.  Jesseca started harassing Heather with\r\ntelephone calls. When Heather learned that Jesseca was making serious and unfounded\r\nallegations against her, she stopped talking to her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLisa Taylor testified that Jesseca was her daughter's best friend while growing up in\r\nAlabama.  Ms. Taylor knew Jessica as \"sweet, outgoing, outspoken, funny.\"  She said that\r\nJesseca, appellant, and Amora visited them in Alabama twice in the fall of 2008.  First,  they\r\ncame for one night in October. Jesseca was making \"bizarre\" accusations about her mother. \r\nIn November, the trio returned to Alabama for about four days and said that they were\r\nplanning to move there.  Ms. Taylor said that there was a \"drastic change\" in Jesseca's\r\ndemeanor.  She was \"[w]eird, hollow. . . [l]ike empty.\"  Looking into her eyes was \"like\r\nlooking into a dark space.\"  Jesseca was not taking care of Amora and did not give her a bath\r\nfor the whole week.  She had appellant change Amora's diaper and feed her.   Jesseca\r\nseemed in charge, and when she told appellant to do something, he did it.  Ms. Taylor was\r\nconcerned that there was something profound going on in Jesseca's life and was worried\r\nabout her and her baby.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Murphy, testified that he was asked to \"offer an opinion in\r\nthis case of the mental state of Jesseca Carson for the time period beginning sometime around\r\nAugust of 2008 through December 2nd of 2008.\"  Dr. Murphy read interviews with Jesseca\r\nand other materials but did not talk to Jesseca.  Dr. Murphy said Jesseca's symptoms were\r\nconsistent with a \"psychotic depression . . . .  The depression occurs first, and then it gets\r\nsevere enough that psychosis or loss of touch with reality then occurs . . . .  Psychosis means\r\nsomeone has lost touch with reality. The vast majority of times, that means either they're\r\nhallucinating or they're delusional.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defense odontologist, Dr. Isaac, studied five of the bite marks, and could not\r\nexclude either appellant or Jesseca.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C. \tThe State's Punishment-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State offered evidence that appellant was-at the time of this crime-on probation\r\nfor solicitation of aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of fourteen.  Appellant\r\nhad entered the home of an eleven-year-old neighbor, Karah Hodges, and left a stack of\r\npages torn from pornographic magazines, marked with salacious notes, in Karah's dresser\r\ndrawer.  Appellant's probation terms prohibited him from going within \"200 feet of a\r\npremise where children commonly gather, including school, daycare facility, playground,\r\npublic or private youth center, public swimming pool, or video facility.\" Appellant's \"mere\r\npresence\" with Amora was, therefore, a continuing probation violation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRanger Ray was recalled to play the entire patrol-car conversation he had recorded\r\nwith appellant.  Appellant had told Ranger Ray that a third party had forced him to solicit\r\nKarah Hodges.  He also discussed several assaults, all of which he described as being of the\r\n\"he had it coming\" variety.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGlenda Risinger, who rented an apartment to appellant and Jesseca in the fall of 2008,\r\ntestified that when the pair left, the apartment \"was trashed. There was stuff left everywhere.\r\nThe refrigerator was left open with food still in it. . . . It was pretty much just like they just\r\nwent through and trashed it.\"  She also found a lightbulb containing methamphetamine and\r\na hunting knife in the toilet tank.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBryan Perkins, appellant's former boss, testified that appellant had  \"control issues\"\r\nand a \"very short\" fuse.  Appellant would bring Jesseca to work to keep an eye on her. Mr.\r\nPerkins said, \"I started talking to him about his controlling problems, you know, that if he\r\nkept on controlling his woman, she was going to leave him. And, you know, he just said it\r\nseemed like, you know, with that baby, him and Jesseca were not really going to have a life.\" \r\nMr. Perkins also described a fight appellant had with a customer.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMonty Clark, a Rusk County patrol deputy, testified that, in January 2008, he\r\nresponded to a fight on the side of the road between appellant and his brother, Danny.  He\r\narrested appellant for assault and family violence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Kenneth McDade, a fellow  inmate, testified that appellant told him about a plan to\r\nescape from the jail and also threatened to stab him with a pencil.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJesseca's friend, Crystal Zapata, described an incident that occurred after appellant's\r\nfather died in September but before Amora was killed in December.  Ms. Zapata was inside\r\nthe trailer with Amora, while appellant and Jesseca were arguing outside.  Appellant had a\r\ngun and threatened suicide; Jesseca was trying to calm him down. Ms. Zapata heard a\r\ngunshot.  After a few minutes Jesseca came in the door crying and told Ms. Zapata that he\r\nhad shot into the floorboard of her car when she tried to keep him from leaving. Ms. Zapata\r\ncharacterized appellant as dominant in the relationship.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D. \tThe Defense Punishment-Stage Evidence.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe defense sought to rebut the State's future-dangerousness evidence with both lay\r\nand expert witnesses.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's mother, Shirley Milam, attributed appellant's solicitation of aggravated\r\nsexual assault to his mental immaturity.  She said he stopped maturing emotionally at age\r\ntwelve.  She testified that appellant had an on-and-off methamphetamine problem and that\r\nhe had started using drugs again shortly after his father's death.  Shirley testified that, after\r\nthe second time appellant tried to commit suicide to \"go be with [his] daddy,\" she\r\nunsuccessfully tried to have him civilly committed.  In early November, Jesseca and\r\nappellant brought a Ouija board to Shirley's work and told her that they could communicate\r\nwith their dead fathers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's older sister testified that appellant was a polite, passive child and a polite,\r\npassive adult.  This crime was completely out of character for him.  Appellant's childhood\r\nfriend said that he did not think appellant was capable of Amora's murder or aggravated\r\nsexual assault.  He echoed what appellant's family members said about the effect of his\r\nfather's death:  \"It affected him really bad, because like him and his dad was real close.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Patricia Rosen, a medical toxicologist, testified that toxicology reports indicated\r\nthat appellant had 0.17 milligrams of methamphetamine per liter of blood in his system on\r\nDecember 2nd.  Dr. Rosen said this was a \"high\" dose-ten times the therapeutic dose. \r\nAnother expert testified about the effects of methamphetamine on the brain and gave her\r\nopinion that appellant was a chronic methamphetamine user, whose heavy use could have\r\ncaused severe psychosis.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Mark Cunningham, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified that he was asked\r\nto evaluate two issues concerning appellant: 1) \"how did we get here?\" and 2) \"where do we\r\ngo from here?\" Dr.  Cunningham interviewed appellant three times, for a total of nearly ten\r\nhours.  He also interviewed appellant's mother and sisters, and reviewed \"a huge volume of\r\nrecords.\"  Dr. Cunningham summarized the answer to the \"how did we get here\" question: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere's mental deficiency, youthfulness, meth dependence, meth psychosis,\r\nJesseca's psychosis. Those are all interacting with each other. That's all part\r\nof the matrix of his psyche. Now, it's not just those things, of course. There's\r\nalso the trauma and deprivation, the social deprivation I'm describing, as well\r\nas the trauma of his dad's illness, and those experiences. There is the social\r\nisolation that came about that robs him of social resources that he might have\r\ncalled upon for some reality testing. There's premature responsibility. There's\r\nthe death of his father. All of these things are being loaded on and are\r\ninteracting with each other, as we're coming up to this offense, and the effect\r\nof that is this tragedy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDr. Cunningham answered the \"where do we go from here?\" question by outlining the\r\nreasons why appellant was \"likely to have a nonviolent adjustment, in terms of no serious\r\nviolence, to a life without parole sentence in TDCJ.\" </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><span>\tAppellant's \"nonviolent adjustment to 17 months jail pretrial\";<sup> (6)</sup></span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\t\"Appraisal of the correctional staff was not that [appellant] was going to be a\r\npredatory inmate that they needed to lock down\";</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tAppellant's history of employment: starting work at 16, and gaining \"a pretty\r\nsignificant employment history for a kid that's arrested when he's 18\";</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tAppellant's continuing contact and relationship with family;</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tThe relatively low rate of major assaults committed by capital inmates serving\r\na life term;</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tThe fact of serving a sentence of life without parole (\"inmates facing\r\nlife-without-parole sentences and long sentences have more to lose. This is\r\nwhere they're going to be for a very long time and potentially the rest of their\r\nlives, and because of that, they are particularly motivated not to make this\r\nexperience any more horrible on themselves than it has to be.\");</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tThe fact that he would be an inmate in the Texas prison system (\"99.9 percent\r\nof inmates in Texas prisons in 2009 did not commit an assault resulting in\r\ninjuries with more than first aid treatment\");</span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br>  <li><span>\tThe option of appellant going to the Hodge Unit (\"a unit for intellectually\r\nlimited individuals\" with a program designed to meet their needs \"and help\r\nprevent them from being victimized by other inmates\"); </span></li>\r\n\r\n<br><br></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The option of protective custody (\"because of the nature of his offense . . . for\r\nhis safety so that other inmates didn't act out on him. Those conditions of\r\nconfinement would look in many ways like administrative segregation.\")</li></ul></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><span>On cross-examination, Dr. Cunningham testified that he is always a defense expert because\r\n\"the research is very clear that the overwhelming majority of capital offenders will never be\r\nviolent in prison, that the rates of serious violence in prison are very low, that prisons are\r\nextraordinarily effective in minimizing the occurrence of serious violence.\"<strong>II.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>A.\tAppellant's Oral Statement to Ranger Ray.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his first two points of error, appellant argues that the admission of his oral\r\nstatement to Ranger Ray violated both Article 38.22 and his Fifth Amendment rights. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRanger Ray did not read appellant his statutory or <em>Miranda </em>rights, so the admissibility\r\nof his oral statement depends upon whether appellant was in custody-\"a term of art that\r\nspecifies circumstances that are thought generally to present a serious danger of\r\ncoercion\"<sup> (7)</sup>-when he gave it. We address these points together because \"[o]ur construction\r\nof 'custody' for purposes of Article 38.22 is consistent with the meaning of 'custody' for\r\npurposes of <em>Miranda</em>.\"<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court recently reiterated the test for determining whether a person is in\r\ncustody for purposes of <em>Miranda</em>: The first step \"is to ascertain whether, in light of the\r\nobjective circumstances of the interrogation, a reasonable person would have felt he or she</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave.\"<sup> (9)</sup>  If the answer is \"yes,\" then we\r\nask the \"additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently\r\ncoercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda</em>.\"<sup> (10)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Dowthitt</em>, we outlined four general situations which <em>may</em> constitute custody: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(1) when the suspect is physically deprived of his freedom of action in any\r\nsignificant way; (2) when a law enforcement officer tells the suspect that he\r\ncannot leave; (3) when law enforcement officers create a situation that would\r\nlead a reasonable person to believe that his freedom of movement has been\r\nsignificantly restricted; and  (4) when there is probable cause to arrest [and the\r\nofficers' knowledge of probable cause is communicated to the suspect] and\r\nlaw enforcement officers do not tell the suspect that he is free to leave.<sup> (11)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>These situations <em>will</em> indicate custody if the circumstances would lead a reasonable person\r\nto believe that he is under restraint to the degree associated with an arrest.<sup> (12)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe afford almost total deference to a trial judge's \"custody\" ruling when the questions\r\nof historical fact turn on credibility or demeanor, and otherwise review the ruling <em>de novo</em>.<sup> (13)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe first examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation-\"the location\r\nof the questioning, its duration, statements made during the interview, the presence or\r\nabsence of physical restraints during the questioning, and the release of the interviewee at\r\nthe end of the questioning\"<sup> (14)</sup>-to determine whether a reasonable person in appellant's shoes\r\nwould have felt he was not at liberty to end the interrogation and leave.<sup> (15)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant agreed to talk to Ranger Ray, and the questioning took place in the ranger's\r\npatrol car parked in appellant's driveway.  The interview was relatively short, just under one\r\nhour.  Statements made to and questions asked of appellant ranged from friendly to\r\naccusatory.  Appellant was not handcuffed or physically restrained, and he was released from\r\nthe patrol car at the end of the interview.  But, as appellant points out, before talking to\r\nRanger Ray, he had been told that he would be taken to the county jail for further questions\r\nand the collection of his clothes. He told Ranger Ray, as the interview was ending,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Appellant:\tYeah, and they're taking me and Jess up to the police station.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Ray:\t\tI don't know anything about that.  Okay.  Well, I tell you what, let's-let me-let\r\nme put just a little old ending on this tape. It's approximately 12:36 p.m., and,\r\nagain, I'm-this is Sergeant Kenny Ray with the Texas Rangers out of Tyler,\r\nand I've been conducting a noncustodial interview with Blain Keith Milam at\r\nhis residence in the northern part of Rusk County on County Road 2125. And\r\nyou are free to go, my friend.  Thank you for talking to me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Appellant:\tAll right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tUnder these circumstances, the various law-enforcement officers created a situation\r\nthat could possibly lead a reasonable person to believe that his freedom of movement had\r\nbeen significantly, if temporarily, restricted. We therefore look to the additional question of\r\n\"whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the\r\ntype of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda</em>.\"<sup> (16)</sup> Or as stated in <em>Dowthitt</em>, we look\r\nto see if the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that he is under restraint\r\nto the degree associated with an arrest.<sup> (17)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court, in <em>Howes v. Fields</em>, singled out communicated non-custodial\r\nstatus as the most important factor in determining that an inmate taken from his cell to a\r\nprison conference room for questioning about events that occurred outside the prison was not\r\n\"in custody\" for <em>Miranda</em>.<sup> (18)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThat critical factor was present here.  Ranger Ray consistently told appellant he was\r\nnot in custody:  \"you're not under arrest\"; \"you don't have handcuffs on\"; \"we're just sitting\r\nand visiting\"; \"you know you're not under arrest.  You're not in custody, okay\"; \"You can\r\ndo whatever you want.  You're not under arrest\"; \"We're through talking.  Like I told you,\r\nyou're sitting in my car.  You don't have handcuffs on.  You came over here voluntarily. \r\nWe've just-we've just been sitting here talking.  You're not-You're fixing to just get out and\r\nwalk out.  I mean, you're not under arrest.

This was a major violent crime.  Reasonable people are well\r\naware that, as a matter of course, evidence is collected from crime scenes and from the\r\npeople present at crime scenes.<sup> (19)</sup> Further, appellant was told that his mother and brother\r\nwould also be taken to the police station and then brought back.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Appellant:\tWhere's my mama?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Roy:\t\tHer and Danny went up to the office. . .

Witt</em>.<sup> (22)</sup>   In a capital prosecution, a prospective juror is not subject\r\nto a challenge for cause merely because he is opposed to or has \"conscientious scruples\"\r\nabout the death penalty.<sup> (23)</sup>  Under <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Witt</em>, however, the trial judge may excuse\r\nprospective jurors based upon their views of the death penalty if these views would \"prevent\r\nor substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his\r\ninstructions and his oath.\"<sup> (24)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion in ruling on a challenge\r\nfor cause, we review the voir dire record in its entirety and ask whether the judge had a\r\nrational basis for his ruling.<sup> (25)</sup>  We grant the trial judge considerable deference, because he\r\nis in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror's demeanor and responses.<sup> (26)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the trial judge instructed the prospective jurors that they should not come\r\nforward at the end of the judge's voir dire to discuss their feelings about the death penalty,\r\nbut instead should wait until they were called individually.  Despite that request, venireman\r\nTrzeciak came forward and indicated that he did not think that there were any circumstances\r\nin which he could vote for the death penalty.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak:\tMy thought on that is-I wanted to share with the Court that I don't believe\r\nthere's a circumstance where I could condone or vote for the death penalty,\r\nbased on my personal religious beliefs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Judge:\tAll right.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tMr. Trzeciak, basically, you just wanted to come tell the Court that no matter\r\nwhat circumstances may be out there, you've already decided you could not\r\nconsider the death penalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tI cannot do that, yes.<center></center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tIrrelevant of whatever that may be?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tIrrelevant of whatever that may be.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tYou felt compelled to come tell us that now, rather than waiting to\r\nquestioning, because you feel that strongly about it?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak:\tWell, I feel that strongly about it, and I didn't want to waste the Court's time\r\nin the future.  I didn't know if that was going to be captured later on based\r\nupon the questionnaire that you put out, so I just wanted to let that be known\r\nnow.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Defense:\t . . . If the Court asks you or instructs you to render a true verdict, meaning will\r\nyou answer those questions truthfully, the first one being in essence from\r\nlistening to all the testimony, can you make a decision as to whether or not the\r\ndefendant will be a danger to commit future acts of criminal violence, to be\r\nviolent in the future?  Could you answer that question truthfully, if so\r\ninstructed?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tWell, I'm going to try.  I understand the question you're asking.  If you're\r\nasking.  I would then go back to-in today's society, in my opinion and the\r\nopinion of my church, there's no justification for the death penalty.  If\r\nI-rendering some sort of verdict in phase two, the potential exists for the death\r\npenalty; I could not vote that way.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>***</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Prosecutor: \tOkay.  But that based upon your religious feelings, that you would be very,\r\nvery compromised to be in this sort of a situation?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tThat's correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>***</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Judge: \tSir, let me ask you this question.  Can you return a verdict which assesses the\r\ndeath penalty in a case?  You understand you're never going to write \"death\r\npenalty.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tRight.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Judge: \tBut can you, in good conscience-and I don't care what your answer is.  I just\r\nneed to know.  Can you return a verdict which assesses a death penalty?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Trzeciak: \tI could not. \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State challenged Mr. Trzeciak for cause.  Appellant objected, arguing that Mr.\r\nTrzeciak said that he would answer the questions truthfully, despite his views on the death\r\npenalty.  The judge overruled the objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t Appellant now argues that the State did not go far enough to disqualify Mr. Trzeciak\r\nbecause he never explicitly said that he would consciously distort answers to the special\r\nissues to prevent imposition of the death penalty.  But Mr. Trzeciak was clear that he could\r\nnot follow the law in answering the special issues and would be unable to return a verdict\r\nleading to the death penalty.  Although he stated that he would \"answer questions truthfully,\"\r\nhe also said that there was no set of circumstances under which the death penalty would be\r\njustified, based on his religious beliefs.  Furthermore, Mr. Trzeciak explicitly stated that he\r\ncould not return a death-penalty verdict.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn this record we cannot find that trial judge abused his discretion in granting the\r\nState's challenge for cause.  Mr. Trzeciak's answers concerning his inability to assess the\r\ndeath penalty under any circumstances were sufficient to support the trial judge's  conclusion\r\nthat he would be substantially impaired in his abilities as a juror.<sup> (27)</sup>  Accordingly, we overrule\r\nappellant's third point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>2.\tVeniremember Shaw</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fourth point of error, appellant contends that the trial judge erred in overruling\r\nhis <em>Batson</em><sup> (28)</sup> challenge to the State's peremptory strike of black veniremember Shaw.  A\r\ndefendant objecting under <em>Batson</em> must make a <em>prima facie</em> showing of racial discrimination\r\nin the State's exercise of its peremptory challenges.<sup> (29)</sup>  If the defendant makes a <em>prima facie\r\n</em>showing of discriminatory motives, the State then has the burden to produce a race-neutral\r\nexplanation.<sup> (30)</sup>  If the State articulates a race-neutral explanation, the burden remains with  the\r\ndefendant to show that the State's proffered reasons are mere pretexts for discrimination.<sup> (31)</sup> \r\nThe trial judge must then decide whether the defendant has proven purposeful\r\ndiscrimination.<sup> (32)</sup>  Because the trial judge's decision often turns largely on an evaluation of\r\ncredibility, we give the judge's ruling great deference and will not disturb it unless it is\r\nclearly erroneous.<sup> (33)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the defense objected under <em>Batson</em> to the State's use of a peremptory challenge\r\nagainst veniremember Shaw, the prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for her strike. \r\nThe prosecutor explained that she struck Ms. Shaw because she indicated, at least eight times\r\non her questionnaire, that she was personally against the death penalty.<sup> (34)</sup> \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argued in response that the State spent nearly two hours questioning Shaw\r\nduring voir dire, which was the longest amount of time spent with any prospective juror\r\nbesides veniremember Lucas, also a black juror.  Appellant added that the prosecutor twice\r\nreferred to Ms. Shaw outside of the courtroom as an \"angry black female.\"  The prosecutor\r\nadmitted to using the term after questioning Ms. Shaw, but stated that neither that remark nor\r\nShaw's race had anything to do with the strike.  Regarding the two hours of questioning, the\r\nprosecutor explained that she had hoped to be able to challenge Ms. Shaw for cause because\r\nof her views about the death penalty in her questionnaire answers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the State offered race-neutral reasons for its strike and appellant failed to\r\nrebut those reasons, we hold that the trial judge did not clearly err in denying appellant's\r\n<em>Batson</em> challenge.<sup> (35)</sup>  Appellant's fourth point of error is overruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>C.\tThe Admission of Autopsy Photographs.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifth point of error, appellant argues that the trial judge erred by admitting\r\nhighly prejudicial and irrelevant autopsy photographs.  He specifically complains that the\r\nadmission of State's Exhibits 92-112 violated Texas Rule of Evidence 403, as well as the\r\ndue-course-of-law and due-process clauses of the Texas and U.S. Constitutions.  Because his\r\nonly argument deals with Rule 403, that is the only basis for exclusion that we will address.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder Rule 403, if the use of a photograph is helpful and \"relevant, legitimate, and\r\nlogical to the testimony that accompanies it,\" the trial judge may exclude it only if its\r\nemotional and prejudicial aspects substantially outweigh the helpful aspects.<sup> (36)</sup> In a Rule 403\r\nanalysis of autopsy photos, factors such as the \"number of exhibits offered, their\r\ngruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and white or color, whether they\r\nare close-up, whether the body is naked or clothed\" are appropriate for consideration.<sup> (37)</sup>  We\r\nreview the trial judge's Rule 403 ruling for an abuse of discretion.<sup> (38)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues that these autopsy photographs had no probative value concerning\r\nany disputed fact because he did not contest the manner and cause of Amora's injuries or\r\ndeath.  Although he did not expressly contest the manner and cause of Amora's death,\r\nappellant did hold the State to its burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt by\r\nconsistently challenging the rough-shod manner of the investigation and handling of physical\r\nevidence.  He also challenged the assertion that most of the injuries were inflicted before\r\nAmora's death.  Moreover, the State had the burden of proving that appellant intentionally\r\nor knowingly murdered the infant, \"and the photographic representation of the injuries tends\r\nto establish this element in a way which testimony by witnesses could not as accurately\r\nportray.\"<sup> (39)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe autopsy photographs admitted-only twenty of the some 300 autopsy photos-were\r\npersonally selected by the medical examiner, Dr. Keith Pinckard, to best illustrate his\r\ntestimony.<sup> (40)</sup>  The color photographs were displayed on a projector.   Multiple photographs\r\nwere necessary because multiple injuries were inflicted.  Dr. Pinckard testified that, even\r\nafter the autopsy, he could not tell exactly which injury caused death.  Rather</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tthere were many injuries present, and there was also, as I indicated, the pretty\r\ngood possibility that strangulation was also involved.  So we have the\r\npossibility for strangulation.  We have a head injury that could easily cause\r\ndeath.  We have a liver injury that might cause death, although there wasn't a\r\nwhole lot of bleeding, so maybe not here.  And then, of course, we have a\r\nnumber of injuries to-just the bruising itself was so extensive on the body, you\r\ncan actually experience effects just from the amount of bleeding that occurs\r\ninto the tissue.  So rather than anything specific, we certified the cause of death\r\nas homicidal violence, because it was obviously inflicted, including multiple\r\nblunt force injuries and possible strangulations.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The autopsy photographs were probative of the fact that this was a cruel and deliberate\r\nkilling-with multiple injuries inflicted ante-mortem, rather than post-mortem.  These \r\nphotographs, which simply showed the number and type of injuries Amora suffered, could\r\nadd little to improperly inflame or prejudice the jury.  The trial judge did not abuse his\r\ndiscretion in admitting the autopsy photographs.<sup> (41)</sup>  We overrule appellant's fifth point of\r\nerror. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>D.\tCrime Lab Accreditation-Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 38.35</strong>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixth point of error, appellant argues that the trial judge abused his discretion\r\nin admitting the testimony of Dr. Robert Williams, a forensic odontologist, in violation of\r\nArticle 38.35-which makes the admissibility of some forensic evidence contingent on\r\nwhether the analysis of the evidence was conducted at an accredited laboratory.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tArticle 38.35(d) provides, in relevant part, that </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\ta forensic analysis of physical evidence under this article and expert testimony\r\nrelating to the evidence are not admissible in a criminal action if, at the time\r\nof the analysis, the crime laboratory conducting the analysis was not accredited\r\nby the director under Section 411.0205, Government Code.<sup> (42)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Subsection (d) was added to Article 38.35 in 2003, in response to problems with the DNA\r\nevidence testing and examination operations in the Houston Police Department Crime Lab.<sup> (43)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore Dr. Williams testified, a hearing was held, outside the jury's presence, on\r\nappellant's Article 38.35 challenge.  Appellant did not dispute that Dr. Williams is the chief\r\nforensic odontologist for SWIFS<sup> (44)</sup> or that SWIFS is an accredited crime lab.  His objection\r\nwas two-fold.  First, appellant alleged that Dr. Williams's work in this case was done as part\r\nof his private dental practice, rather than for SWIFS. Second, SWIFS, although accredited\r\nthrough ASCLD/LAB-L<sup> (45)</sup> for various scientific disciplines, was not certified for odontology. \r\nThe trial judge overruled appellant's objections, but gave him a running objection to all of\r\nDr. Williams's testimony. We review that ruling for an abuse of discretion.<sup> (46)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, the record supports the trial judge's implicit finding that Dr. Williams conducted\r\nthis analysis for SWIFS.  The medical examiner testified that, because it was \"incredibly\r\nobvious\" that the baby was covered in human bite marks, he called in Dr. Williams \"so that\r\nhe would he able to take his own photographs.\"  Dr. Williams testified that he is an\r\nindependent contractor for SWIFS.  He said that he was called to the autopsy suite at SWIFS\r\nby Dr. Pinckard, the medical examiner.  When he gets such a call, he winds up the work in\r\nhis own practice \"immediately\" and then heads for the Medical Examiner's Office.  Dr.\r\nWilliams explained that he works as an independent contractor for a number of labs because\r\nmost medical examiner offices \"do not have the budget to be able to pay someone a full-time\r\nsalary[.]\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, SWIFS, according to Defense Exhibit 9 (\"Current List of DPS Accredited\r\nLabs from Texas, 8/6/2009\"), was one of eight accredited labs, and in fact the most\r\nextensively \"accredited\" of the eight.<sup> (47)</sup>  Article 38.35 does not specify that the crime\r\nlaboratory must be certified in the exact discipline that is the subject of the testimony.<sup> (48)</sup> And\r\nodontology is not one of the disciplines for which accreditation is available.<sup> (49)</sup>  Nevertheless,\r\nodontology is a species of impression evidence, and Chapter 37, Section 28.145(d) of the\r\nTexas Administrative Code provides that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tthe subdiscipline of impression evidence, including footwear, tiretrack, and\r\nsimilar impression evidence, may be administratively assigned by the\r\nlaboratory to its trace evidence section, firearms section, or questioned\r\ndocument section. The director deems impression evidence to be a\r\nsubdiscipline of several disciplines under this subchapter, including trace\r\nevidence, firearms/toolmark, or questioned documents.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>SWIFS was, as the prosecutor pointed out to the trial judge, accredited in the trace-evidence\r\nand firearms/toolmark disciplines.  Given this record, we conclude that the trial judge did not\r\nabuse his discretion in overruling appellant's objection to Dr. Williams's testimony.<sup> (50)</sup>  We\r\noverrule point of error six.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>E.\tFuture Dangerousness.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his seventh point of error, appellant argues that the evidence is legally insufficient\r\nto support the jury's affirmative answer to the \"future-dangerousness\" special issue. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA jury may consider a variety of factors when determining whether a defendant will</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>pose a continuing threat to society.<sup> (51)</sup> The facts of the offense alone may suffice to support\r\nthe jury's finding of future dangerousness.<sup> (52)</sup>  We view the evidence in the light most\r\nfavorable to the jury's finding and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\r\nfound, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there is a probability that appellant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.<sup> (53)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe circumstances of Amora's murder are, by themselves, sufficient to sustain the\r\njury's finding of future dangerousness.  Appellant savagely beat, bit, strangled, and sexually\r\nmutilated the thirteen-month old daughter of his girlfriend-either alone or with her.  Dr.\r\nPinckard testified that this was \"not a quick event\" because of the number of injuries that are\r\n\"clearly antemortem.\"  He agreed that \"anyone who would inflict these injuries on Amora\r\nwould have had to have known that death was reasonably certain to be the result.\"  Dr.\r\nPinckard testified that he had never-in his decades of experience-seen a  more severe case\r\nof child abuse.   Evidence that a murder was committed with deliberation and forethought\r\nmay be sufficient for a finding of future dangerousness.<sup> (54)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence of a defendant's prior criminal record may also serve as the basis for a\r\nfinding of future dangerousness, and this jury was presented with evidence of appellant's\r\nprior solicitation of aggravated sexual assault of his eleven-year-old neighbor.<sup> (55)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts that the future-dangerousness special issue requires the jury to\r\ndetermine whether a capital defendant would be a continuing threat to prison society.  And\r\nunder this \"future danger test of <em>Berry</em> [<em>v. State</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101333\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101333/berry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span> (Tex. Crim. App. 2007],\"\r\nthe \"State has failed to prove that [appellant], unless executed, would ever pose the threat of\r\ncriminal violence he posed in this case-danger to a child.\"  That is, if appellant were allowed\r\nto live, he would spend the rest of his life in prison and therefore never have the opportunity\r\nto hurt a child again.  Appellant acknowledges that in <em>Estrada v. State</em> and <em>Coble v. State</em>, we\r\ninterpreted the future-dangerousness special issue to ask whether a defendant would be a\r\ncontinuing threat \"whether in or out of prison.\"<sup> (56)</sup> Appellant asserts that the <em>Coble-Estrada</em>\r\nconstruction of the future-danger test permits consideration of hypothetical predictions and\r\nis inconsistent with the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Jurek v. Texas</em>,<sup> (57)</sup> which interpreted the\r\nTexas statute as \"requiring a literal prediction of future criminal conduct made to further the\r\ngoal of incapacitation.\"<sup> (58)</sup>  He argues, \"Keeping faith with <em>Jurek</em>, this Court should here apply\r\nthe future danger test of <em>Berry</em> which considers the restraints inherent in the alternative\r\nsentence to death.\"<sup> (59)</sup>  We have rejected this argument.<sup> (60)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurther, the State's case for future dangerousness was not \"child-specific.\"  The jury\r\nheard about appellant's escalating pattern of violence.  He settled his scores with adults with\r\nviolence-he \"caught a guy in his apartment, and he commenced to whupping his ass.\"   He\r\n\"took care of\" a guy he found with his niece.  He fought with his brother because he was\r\ntired of arguing about cigarette smoke: \"I was tired of arguing with him, and I wasn't going\r\nto argue with him, so I hit him in the mouth.\" Deputy Clark-who investigated the\r\nfight-testified that appellant's mother asked him, \"What can be done about Blaine?\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tShe said that his temper had progressed from the years. She said that he had\r\nbegan with becoming upset and showing anger through his emotions, and she\r\nsaid he went from that to verbal abuse. She said over the years he went to\r\nphysical abuse, and she said that it's been ongoing and uncontrollable. She\r\nsaid this is just getting to the point where she couldn't control it, and now [his]\r\nbrother is getting to where he can't control it. And she asked me what can be\r\ndone about his--about his actions . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAnd this case is distinguishable from <em>Berry</em> for yet another reason: The jury heard that\r\nappellant, while he was in Rusk County jail, told another inmate of his plan to escape.  \"He\r\nsaid his brother was going to have a bomb threat put on the jail, so that everybody in K Tank\r\nwould get let out.\"  He was then going to escape to Mexico.  Appellant ended up threatening\r\nthis inmate after they got in to an argument, saying \"if I kept messing with him, I would wake\r\nup with a pencil in my side.\"  Because he feared retaliation, the inmate never reported the\r\nthreat until appellant was moved from K Tank.  Appellant's pattern of violence did not\r\ndiminish, even in jail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving viewed all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury's finding, we\r\nconclude that a rational jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, a probability that\r\nappellant would pose a continuing threat to society.<sup> (61)</sup> Point of error seven is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>F.\tRacial Prejudice.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his eighth point of error, appellant argues that the trial judge erred, in the\r\npunishment phase, in admitting evidence of appellant's father's racial prejudice.  Appellant's\r\nfriend, Chris Lay, testified about the end of appellant's schooling in the fourth grade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>A. \tEducationally [he was slow], because, I mean, he got pulled out of school in the\r\nfourth grade because people picking on him, you know. His dad got tired of it and\r\nsaid he didn't want him in school no more, if everybody was going to mess with him\r\nlike that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>On cross-examination, the prosecutor revisited appellant's exit from school:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q. \tAnd you've-you visited with Missy, our investigator, over the weekend, right? . . .\r\nAnd you told her that part of the reason why he got pulled out of school was because\r\nhis dad was upset because his principal was black.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A. \tWell, he was upset because-yeah, that, too.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The trial judge overruled appellant's Rule 403 objection.  Outside the presence of the jury,\r\nthe prosecutor explained that she presented the evidence to refute the false impression that\r\nMr. Lay had given to the jury.<sup> (62)</sup>  Defense counsel pointed out that the jury already knew,\r\nfrom previous testimony, that appellant was pulled from school after the paddling and that\r\nthis was</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tnothing more than a direct appeal to that jury for unfair prejudice against him\r\nthrough his father. It's not like this man had any belief like this. We're talking\r\nabout a child who was in the fourth grade. And they want to bring in the fact\r\nthe father pulled him out because the principal was black? And I believe what\r\nthe witness testified to is he was pulled out because he was paddled, which\r\nwas not a false impression, because that's exactly what the jury was told. It\r\njust-you noted it for the record. You've done-you've made your ruling, and\r\nI've had my say. Fine. Move again for a mistrial.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial judge overruled the motion for mistrial, but gave the jury the following\r\nlimiting instruction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tLadies and gentlemen, the Court overlooked this prior to beginning the\r\ntestimony of this witness. I want to instruct you concerning some prior\r\ntestimony this morning. You're not to hold any alleged racial statements\r\nallegedly made by this defendant's father against this defendant, or infer that\r\nthis statement or these statements are or is the belief or view of this defendant,\r\nand any racial content of any alleged statement is not to be inferred upon this\r\ndefendant. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant now argues that \"it was irrelevant that the principal who paddled Milam,\r\ncausing his father to take him out of school, was African-American.\"<sup> (63)</sup>  The State counters\r\nthat the evidence was relevant to impeach Mr. Lay and \"to counter the assertion that the sole\r\nreason Appellant was removed from school was because he was unfairly picked on.\"<sup> (64)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial judge's relevancy rulings will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.<sup> (65)</sup>\r\nAppellant relies on <em>Bell v. State</em>, in which the Beaumont Court of Appeals held that it was\r\nreversible error for the State to elicit testimony, at the punishment stage, from the defendant's\r\nmother about racially charged comments she overheard after her son was found guilty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe fact that Ms. Bell may have heard the jury or the prosecutor referred to as\r\n\"prejudiced\" or \"redneck,\" or that she heard someone comment that the verdict\r\nwas unfair because of the fact that the appellant was Black and the jury was\r\nentirely white, without having first connected the source of said comments to\r\nappellant's family or friends, was simply irrelevant as to any issue regarding\r\nappellant.<sup> (66)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOne critical difference between <em>Bell</em> and this case is that in <em>Bell</em>, it was the jury itself\r\nthat was accused of being racist.<sup> (67)</sup> Further, in this case, the trial judge instructed the jury not\r\nto hold appellant's father's possible racism against appellant. There is no indication that the\r\njury disregarded the trial judge's instruction, and we must presume that it followed those\r\ninstructions.<sup> (68)</sup>  Point of error eight is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>G.\tExamining Experts: <em>Lagrone</em>.</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's ninth, tenth, and eleventh points of error address the trial judge's ruling,\r\nmade at appellant's request, that the experts interviewing appellant be prohibited from asking\r\nhim about the facts of Amora's murder.  Specifically, appellant argues that the State's\r\nquestioning of both the defense and State's experts about that prohibition violated appellant's\r\nright to remain silent (point nine), constituted prosecutorial misconduct (point ten), and\r\ndeliberately deceived the jury (point eleven).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>1.\t<em>Soria</em> / <em>Lagrone</em> / <em>Chamberlain</em></strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn<em> Soria v. State</em>,<sup> (69)</sup> we recognized that a defendant may \"waive\" his Fifth Amendment\r\nrights to a limited extent by presenting psychiatric testimony.   We held that </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\twhen the defendant initiates a psychiatric examination and based thereon\r\npresents psychiatric testimony on the issue of future dangerousness, the trial\r\ncourt may compel an examination of appellant by an expert of the State's or\r\ncourt's choosing and the State may present rebuttal testimony of that expert\r\nbased upon his examination of the defendant; provided, however, that the\r\nrebuttal testimony is limited to the issues raised by the defense expert.<sup> (70)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIn <em>Lagrone v. State</em>, we expanded the scope of the rule to allow trial judges to order\r\ncriminal defendants to submit to a state-sponsored psychiatric exam on future dangerousness\r\nwhen the defense introduces, or <em>plans to introduce,</em> its own future-dangerousness expert\r\ntestimony based upon a psychiatric examination.<sup> (71)</sup> In <em>Chamberlain v. State</em>, we held the rule\r\napplicable even if the appellant introduces the evidence only in rebuttal.<sup> (72)</sup>  We noted that</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t<em>Soria</em> and <em>Lagrone </em>are governed by the principle that if a defendant breaks his\r\nsilence to speak to his own psychiatric expert and introduces that testimony\r\nwhich is based on such interview, he has constructively taken the stand and\r\nwaived his fifth amendment right to refuse to submit to the State's psychiatric\r\nexperts. The focus is the defendant's choice to break his silence.<sup> (73)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith this background, we turn to the relevant facts.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>2.\tRelevant Facts</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBefore trial, the State filed a motion for a psychological evaluation of appellant to\r\nrebut appellant's psychological testimony.  The trial judge conducted a pretrial hearing on\r\nthe motion during which the defense asked that the State's expert be prohibited from asking\r\nappellant questions about the facts of the crime.  The defense said that it had not let its own\r\nexperts talk to appellant about the crime, and that none of them \"have used any information\r\nthat they gained through him concerning the offense in forming any opinions.\"  The defense\r\nopposed inquiry into the facts on a number of grounds, including the Fifth Amendment right\r\nto remain silent.  The State objected, arguing that once a defendant waives his right to remain\r\nsilent by talking to experts, he cannot dictate the questions that he is asked.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tRelying on the language contained in <em>Chamberlain</em>, that \"the essential principles at\r\nwork in<em> Lagrone </em>and <em>Soria</em> are waiver and parity,\"<sup> (74)</sup> the trial judge agreed to limit\r\nexamination to exclude any discussion of the facts of the crime by both parties.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAll right. The Court has reviewed the cases submitted to it, and the Court-and\r\nprimarily based upon language contained in <em>Chamberlain</em>, I am going to limit\r\nthe interview to exclude the offense, with the understanding that defendant's\r\nexperts will be precluded from offering any . . . findings, conclusions, or\r\nopinions based upon any interview or conversations of the defendant, by the\r\nexpert of the defendant, concerning the offense itself. And, of course, this does\r\nnot preclude any opinions, findings, or conclusions obtained from sources\r\nother than the defendant. Anything further?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, Dr. Cunningham, the defense expert, testified that appellant's mental\r\ndeficiency is sufficiently severe for him to meet the diagnostic criteria for mental retardation. \r\nHe also testified that appellant had psychotic symptoms related to his methamphetamine\r\nabuse, and that \"given the extent of methamphetamine that he was using prior to the crime,\r\nit's very likely that he may have been delusional. It may have induced a psychotic state that\r\nlooked similar to schizophrenia. He may have actually had some hallucinations.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn cross-examination by the prosecutor, the following exchange took place:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\t. . . When you interviewed the defendant in those 9 hours that you spent with him, you\r\ndid not ask him one thing about the capital murder for which this jury has convicted\r\nhim, did you?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tThat's correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q.\tWhy?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tWell, primarily because I was instructed by Counsel not to go into the circumstances,\r\nthe events of the offense itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q.\tReally?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tYes, ma'am.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefense counsel then renewed the Fifth Amendment objection he had made at the\r\npretrial hearing. The State responded, \"He didn't remain silent. He waived his right to remain\r\nsilent, and in talking to the expert, he-there is no such thing as a partial waiver. . . . I have\r\nevery right to ask him about that, because it's-once he waives, he waives.\"  The trial judge\r\noverruled the objection, but granted appellant's running objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe prosecutor resumed cross-examination and later asked,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tOkay. Well, I'll come back to that. But you do talk to capital murderers about the facts\r\nof the capital murder they've been convicted of.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tInfrequently. Most of the time I do not. Most of the time defense counsels do not\r\nauthorize a discussion about the capital offense. The defendant retains a Fifth\r\nAmendment right to not incriminate himself, even for an evaluation that's being\r\nperformed for sentencing purposes . . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>In rebuttal, the State called Dr. Tim Proctor, and questioned him as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tOkay. Now, you've told us that you spent a significant amount of time interviewing\r\nthe defendant?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Q.\tWere you permitted to talk to this defendant, Blaine Milam, about the facts of the\r\ncapital murder case for which he has been convicted?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>The trial judge overruled appellant's running objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tDr. Proctor, were you able to speak with the defendant about the facts of the capital\r\nmurder case for which he was convicted by this jury?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tNo.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Later, the prosecutor asked Dr. Proctor about Dr. Cunningham's opinion that appellant might\r\nhave been delusional.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Q.\tIn your field as a psychologist, as a forensic psychologist, is it appropriate to diagnose\r\nsomeone or to opine that someone is psychotic or delusional without having talked to\r\nthem?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A.\tWell, I think the best way for me to answer that is to tell you what I would do and\r\nwhat I would teach my students. And I believe that to make an assertion about what\r\nsomeone's mental state was like at the time of some offense, you have to have talked\r\nto them about that to have a meaningful opinion about that. And without doing that,\r\nI don't know how you can know, especially in the absence of some other piece of\r\nevidence where the person at issue has given a recitation of what happened.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>3.\tPoints of Error Nine, Ten, and Eleven</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues in his ninth point of error that the trial judge erred in allowing the\r\nabove questioning in violation of \"the spirit, if not the letter\" of the trial judge's previous\r\norder and of appellant's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.  In his tenth point of error,\r\nappellant argues that the State's conduct-in exposing the fact that the experts did not talk to\r\nappellant about the facts of the crime-constituted prosecutorial misconduct.  That misconduct\r\n(1) violated his Fifth Amendment right to be free of harm for exercising his right to remain\r\nsilent about the facts of his case,<sup> (75)</sup> and (2) unfairly left \"the jury with the impression that\r\nAppellant, on advice of counsel, was attempting to hide important information that bore on\r\nthe issue.\"<sup> (76)</sup>  In his eleventh point of error, appellant asserts that leaving this\r\nimpression-when it was actually the trial judge's ruling to prohibit the experts from inquiring\r\nabout the facts of the case-amounted to <em>Napue v. Illinois</em><sup> (77)</sup> or \"false testimony\" error because\r\nit discredited appellant and \"undermined his case for mental retardation.\"<sup> (78)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, the trial judge did not err.  This line of questioning did not violate his pretrial\r\norder:  That order limited only the questioning of appellant, not the questioning of testifying\r\nexperts. And the questioning did not violate appellant's Fifth Amendment right to remain\r\nsilent.  Appellant broke his silence to speak to his own psychiatric expert and introduced\r\ntestimony based on that interview, so he constructively took the stand, and waived the Fifth\r\nAmendment \"in the same manner as would his election to testify at trial.\"<sup> (79)</sup> The State was\r\nthen entitled to offer rebuttal testimony limited to the issues raised by the defense expert. It\r\nwas permissible for the State to test Dr. Cunningham's opinions by questioning him (and Dr.\r\nProctor) about how Dr. Cunningham arrived at those opinions.<sup> (80)</sup>  Appellant may not testify\r\nthrough a defense expert and then use the Fifth Amendment as a shield against\r\ncross-examination of that expert on disputed issues.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, there was no misconduct.  The State did not leave a false impression \"that\r\nMilam refused to speak about the facts of the offense, rather than it being the trial court's\r\ndecision that the experts not inquire about the facts of the offense.\"<sup> (81)</sup>  The trial judge limited\r\ninquiry by the experts into the facts of the crime solely at appellant's behest.  Appellant chose\r\nnot to discuss the crime facts with his expert,  and the trial judge entered an order limiting\r\nthese expert examinations only because of appellant's request.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThird, there was no false testimony.  Dr. Cunningham testified he was instructed by\r\ncounsel not to inquire into the facts of the case, and Dr. Proctor testified that he was not able\r\nto speak with the defendant about the facts of the case.<sup> (82)</sup>  These were true assertions.  They\r\ndo not conflict with appellant's request to the trial judge and the trial judge's order based on\r\nthat request.<sup> (83)</sup>  Appellant's points of error nine through eleven are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>H.\tState's Punishment-Stage Closing Argument.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his twelfth point of error, appellant argues that two portions of the State's closing\r\nargument violated his Eighth Amendment right to have the jury consider and give effect to\r\nhis mitigating evidence, and so denied him his right to a fair trial and reliable sentencing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere are four proper areas of jury argument: (1) summation of the evidence presented\r\nat trial; (2) reasonable deduction drawn from that evidence; (3) answer to the opposing\r\ncounsel's argument; or (4) a plea for law enforcement.<sup> (84)</sup>  Any appellate claim that a\r\nprosecution argument strayed outside the bounds of these categories is forfeited if there was\r\nno contemporaneous trial objection.<sup> (85)</sup>  If there was a contemporaneous trial objection to\r\nimproper jury argument, such argument does not result in reversal \"unless, in light of the\r\nrecord as a whole, the argument is extreme or manifestly improper, violative of a mandatory\r\nstatute, or injects new facts harmful to the accused into the trial proceeding.\"<sup> (86)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant complains about two arguments.  First, appellant asserts that the prosecutor\r\nmisstated the law on mitigation, misstated the special issue, and prevented the jury from\r\ngiving effect to appellant's mitigating evidence, when she argued-over a running\r\nobjection-that only evidence of appellant's being abused as a child could justify a life\r\nsentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMitigating evidence is that which lessens a person's moral blameworthiness\r\nfor what he's done. And yes, you have heard evidence from his background\r\nthat is unfortunate. You have heard things that I can agree was not the perfect\r\nlife growing up; however, the problem is, the fundamental problem is that the\r\none type of mitigating evidence that could explain this, that I would suggest\r\nto you might be sufficient to explain this act and this conduct and this crime,\r\nis not here. If there was evidence before you that this defendant had been\r\nhorribly abused as a child, horribly abused as a child, I could stand before you</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span>***</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[objection overruled]</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThank you, Your Honor. If he had been somehow horribly abused as a child,\r\nbitten, beaten, violated, perhaps that would be mitigating evidence that would\r\nlessen his moral blameworthiness sufficiently to warrant life. Folks, that's not\r\nhere. As much-as much as the Milam family did not do right over the years,\r\nthey did not abuse their kids, and nobody else did either. That's not here.\r\nThat's the bottom line, and I would suggest to you that really is the only kind\r\nof mitigating evidence that truly can explain why we're here and truly lessen\r\nmoral blameworthiness for this. I would ask you, when you're looking at the\r\nmitigating evidence, to go back to that life-altering moment when you first saw\r\nand you first realized what he did to Amora, everything he did to Amora, and\r\nask yourself what could possibly mitigate that? That is the bottom line where\r\nthe fourth question is concerned. The answer to the fourth question is \"No.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe prosecutor did not misstate the law on mitigation or the mitigation special issue. \r\nArticle 37.071(f) provides that the jury \"shall consider mitigating evidence to be evidence\r\nthat a juror might regard as reducing the defendant's moral blameworthiness.\"<sup> (87)</sup>   Nor did the\r\nprosecutor prevent the jury from giving effect to appellant's mitigating evidence.  The\r\nargument was a fair rebuttal to defense counsel's argument that appellant </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tis the reason for this system. He's the reason why we don't say, 'Guilty, death\r\npenalty'. . . . How many mitigating factors are there? In fact, I think I have like\r\nthree pages written down here of factors through this kid's life that could be\r\nmitigating and need to be considered . . . . That's why we don't let the mob\r\nmentality decide these cases, because everything that you've heard mitigates\r\nagainst giving this boy death.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>For these reasons, we find nothing in the prosecutor's remarks to reflect that she was asking\r\nthe jury to forgo its duty and automatically answer the special issues in such a way that\r\nappellant would receive the death penalty.<sup> (88)</sup> The trial judge did not err in overruling\r\nappellant's objection.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSecond, appellant complains that the prosecutor violated his right to a reliable\r\nsentencing determination by falsely arguing that the jury had no choice but to assess death: \r\n\"Sometimes the death penalty is society's last line of self-defense. . . . He has earned it, and\r\nyou know it's the only choice.\"  Appellant did not contemporaneously object to this closing\r\nargument, and therefore he has forfeited any complaint on appeal about it.<sup> (89)</sup> We overrule\r\nappellant's twelfth point of error.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>I.\tConstitutional Challenges to the Texas Death Penalty Statute.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's remaining points of error are constitutional challenges to the Texas death-penalty statute.  Appellant candidly acknowledges that all of these challenges have previously\r\nbeen rejected by this Court. Appellant invites us to review our prior positions.  We decline\r\nto do so and briefly answer each claim by citing the controlling authority.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his thirteenth point, appellant challenges the \"10-12\" rule, arguing that it violates\r\nhis rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it leaves jurors in the dark\r\nabout the fact that their failure to unanimously agree on an answer to either special issue\r\nresults in a life sentence.  This Court has rejected these challenges.<sup> (90)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fourteenth point, appellant claims that the trial judge committed reversible error\r\nby charging the jurors that they had discretion to decide whether a particular circumstance\r\nwas mitigating.  Consistent with Article 37.071, §(2)(f)(4), the trial judge charged the jury\r\nthat it \"shall consider mitigating evidence to be evidence that a juror might regard as\r\nreducing the</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>defendant's moral blameworthiness.\" Appellant argues that the statute violates the Eighth\r\nAmendment, \"which permits jurors no such discretion.\"  We have rejected this claim.<sup> (91)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifteenth point, appellant argues that the trial judge's failure to define\r\n\"probability,\" \"criminal acts of violence,\" or \"continuing threat to society\" violated the\r\nconstitutional requirement that each statutory aggravating circumstance genuinely narrows\r\nthe class of persons eligible for the death penalty.  We have repeatedly held that the trial\r\njudge need not define such terms because we presume that the jury understands them.<sup> (92)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixteenth point, appellant argues that the State's unfettered, standardless, and\r\nunreviewable discretion to seek the death penalty violates his rights under the Equal\r\nProtection and Due Process Clauses and results in cruel and unusual punishment.  We have\r\nrepeatedly rejected these contentions.<sup> (93)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his seventeenth point, appellant argues that the Texas death-penalty scheme violates\r\ndue process because the mitigation special issue fails to require the State to prove the absence\r\nof mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, contrary to the <em>Apprendi</em> line of\r\ncases.  And in his eighteenth point, he argues that the scheme violates due course of law and\r\nresults in cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Texas Constitution because of the\r\n\"impossibility of simultaneously restricting the jury's discretion to impose the death penalty\r\nwhile also allowing the jury unlimited discretion to consider all evidence militating against\r\nimposition of the death penalty.\"   We have rejected these claims.<sup> (94)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn points nineteen and twenty, appellant contends that the cumulative effect of these\r\nconstitutional and statutory infringements violates the state and federal constitutions.  Having\r\nfound no such violations, we hold that these claims are without merit.<sup> (95)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tHaving overruled appellant's points of error, we affirm his conviction and sentence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Delivered: May 23, 2012</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Do Not Publish\r\n<p>1.
