Russell, Sr., and Sandra Reece petition this court for a writ of\nmandate ordering the superior court to issue an order compelling the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to extract material witness and\ninmate, Jerome Sidney DeAvila, from his cell so petitioners can depose him. The trial\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fcourt denied petitioners’ request for such an order, finding there was no authority for it\nand that the risks of injury and disruption weighed against the order. Although we do not\ncondone CDCR’s refusal to make DeAvila available for deposition by whatever means\nlegally available to it, we conclude the trial court had discretion to decline to order\nextraction, and accordingly deny the writ.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n       In 2013, DeAvila raped and murdered his grandmother Racheal Russell. The\nfollowing year, he was convicted of these crimes and sentenced to 25 years to life in\nprison. Petitioners are the son and daughter of Racheal Russell, the victim; and petitioner\nSandra Reece is also DeAvila’s mother. After the murder, petitioners brought a wrongful\ndeath lawsuit against the State of California, the CDCR, and the County of San Joaquin,\nalleging negligence in the failure to warn of DeAvila’s release from state custody before\nthe murder and the failure to affix an ankle bracelet GPS monitoring device before his\nrelease.\n       The first amended complaint alleged that DeAvila had a lengthy criminal history\nof sex crimes, drugs, and violence, and was on parole at the time of the murder. One\nrequirement of his parole was that he wear a GPS tracking device around his ankle. Due\nto a sex crime conviction, DeAvila was not allowed to go near a school; his\ngrandmother’s house was near a school. The year before the murder, the police arrested\nDeAvila 16 times for violations of parole or other criminal activity; each time they\nreleased him.\n       The complaint alleged that both the state parole officers and the county jail\npersonnel knew, or should have known, that DeAvila often went to his grandmother’s\nhouse. They also knew DeAvila had threatened his grandmother. Three days before the\nmurder, the police arrested DeAvila for violation of parole. He was under the influence\nof drugs or alcohol and had removed his GPS device. County officials again released\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fDeAvila, without notifying his grandmother or reaffixing the GPS device; state parole\nofficials concurred in the decision.\n       Petitioners gave notice that they would take DeAvila’s deposition, first scheduled\nfor January 8, 2015, then for March 2, at the California Health Care Facility in Stockton\nwhere he was housed. On March 2, arrangements were made to take DeAvila’s\ndeposition in a meeting room to accommodate the court reporter, but DeAvila refused to\nparticipate. He refused to come out of his cell. DeAvila had previously told prison\nofficials he would not permit a videotaped deposition.\n       Petitioners believed DeAvila was an “important witness” and “necessary and\nmaterial” to their case. They wanted to question him about what he had told parole and\nCounty officials about his relationship with his grandmother and his feelings and anger\ntowards her. Pursuant to Penal Code section 2623, they obtained a court order requiring\nDeAvila to participate in the deposition and answer all questions.1 Again, De Avila\nrefused to come out of his cell. CDCR declined to forcibly extract him.\n       Petitioners moved to compel CDCR to forcibly extract DeAvila from his cell at\nthe California Health Care Facility. The motion was supported by the declaration of\nGerry Garcia. Garcia had worked at the California Youth Authority for over 25 years,\nretiring as Captain, Chief of Security. He understood DeAvila had a history of refusing\nto come out of his cell and Garcia believed that he had probably been extracted many\ntimes. In Garcia’s experience, 70 percent of the time, an inmate will voluntarily come\nout of the cell when faced with forcible extraction. He saw no reason why DeAvila could\n\n\n\n\n1  Penal Code section 2623 provides in part: “If in a civil action or special proceeding a\nwitness be a prisoner, confined in a state prison within this state, an order for the\nprisoner's examination in the prison by deposition may be made.” This procedure is in\nlieu of the usual deposition subpoena to a non-party witness. (See Code Civ. Proc.,\n§§ 2020.210, 2020.310.)\n\n                                             3\n\fnot be extracted from his cell. Garcia stated, “Inmates are extracted all the time for\ndifferent reasons.”\n       The Warden of Mule Creek State Prison, where DeAvila was then housed,\nopposed the motion, contending there was no authority for compelling an extraction. The\nwarden argued, among other things, that DeAvila was no longer at the California Health\nCare Facility; he was in the general population at Mule Creek State Prison, with minimal\nrestrictions on his movement. This placement made a cell extraction more problematic.\nFurther, there was no guarantee that DeAvila would answer deposition questions after the\nextraction, and any use of force or chemical agents would likely make him less\ncooperative.\n       The opposition was supported by the declaration of R. Roy, a facility captain at\nMule Creek State Prison. Roy detailed the procedure for the involuntary removal of an\ninmate from his cell. Absent an imminent threat to the inmate or staff, any cell extraction\nwould be “controlled” and would require extensive tactical planning, a large amount of\nequipment, and a large number of staff. Before the extraction, staff would assess\nDeAvila’s mental health, medical history, and disciplinary history. A controlled\nextraction is time consuming and could take all day. First, there would be a cool down\nperiod to permit the inmate to comply with the order. This period includes clinical\nintervention by a licensed mental health practitioner and may include dialogue with\nreligious leaders, correctional counselors, or other staff who have developed a rapport\nwith DeAvila. Because DeAvila was in the general population rather than a segregated\nunit, the cell extraction would be more difficult. Because he was receiving mental health\nservices, certain tools such as chemical agents may be prohibited. The actual\nconfrontation could result in harm to DeAvila or staff. A cell extraction disrupts the\nprison environment and may lead to other violence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       The trial court denied the motion to compel a cell extraction. It found no authority\nfor such an order and found that balancing the risk of injury and disruption weighed\nagainst ordering extraction.\n       Petitioners petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to\nvacate its order and to enter a new order granting the motion to compel the cell\nextraction. We issued an order to show cause.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                         Writ of Mandate and Standard of Review\n       “A writ of mandate will lie to ‘compel the performance of an act which the law\nspecifically enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station’ (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 1085) ‘upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested,’ in cases ‘where\nthere is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.’ (Code\nCiv. Proc., § 1086.) The writ will issue against a county, city or other public body or\nagainst a public officer. [Citations.] However, the writ will not lie to control discretion\nconferred upon a public officer or agency. [Citations.] Two basic requirements are\nessential to the issuance of the writ: (1) A clear, present and usually ministerial duty upon\nthe part of the respondent [citations]; and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right in the\npetitioner to the performance of that duty [citations].” (People ex rel. Younger v. County\nof El Dorado (1971) 5 Cal.3d 480, 490-491.)\n       Ordinarily, writ review of discovery orders is disfavored and the aggrieved party\nmust raise the issue on direct appeal from a final judgment. (Sav-On Drugs, Inc. v.\nSuperior Court (1975) 15 Cal.3d 1, 5.) “As a result, writ review of discovery rulings are\nlimited to situations where (1) the issues presented are of first impression and of general\nimportance to the trial courts and to the profession [citation], (2) the order denying\ndiscovery prevents a party from having a fair opportunity to litigate his or her case\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f[citations], or (3) the ruling compelling discovery would violate a privilege [citations].”\n(Johnson v. Superior Court (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1050, 1061 (Johnson).)\n       Here, we review whether the trial court must compel prison authorities to forcibly\nextract DeAvila from his cell to attend a deposition in a civil case to which he is not a\nparty. We issued an order to show cause and proceed to analyze whether CDCR’s refusal\nto forcibly remove DeAvila from his cell for deposition, and the trial court’s subsequent\nrefusal to order CDCR to do so, constituted a violation of the trial court’s clear duty to\nenter the order. We conclude the trial court does not have a clear duty to make the order\nat issue here.\n       We recognize that CDCR is declining to forcibly produce a witness, over which it\nalone has physical control, for deposition in a case in which CDCR is the defendant.\nFurther, CDCR stands accused of misconduct in its failure to monitor defendant, and to\ntake any steps to prevent him from doing harm to his grandmother and to warn her that he\nposed a threat. Despite these compelling facts and circumstances, and CDCR’s apparent\nconflict of interest as it plays the dual roles of defendant’s custodian as well as the entity\nabout whose conduct the plaintiffs seek information, the issue presented--compelling\ndefendant’s custodian to force him to attend a deposition which he has refused to attend--\nboils down to a civil discovery issue.\n       “Management of discovery lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\nConsequently, appellate review of discovery rulings is governed by the abuse of\ndiscretion standard. [Citation.] Where there is a basis for the trial court’s ruling and the\nevidence supports it, a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial\ncourt. [Citation.] The trial court’s determination will be set aside only when it has been\ndemonstrated that there was ‘ “no legal justification” ’ for the order granting or denying\nthe discovery in question. [Citations.]” (Johnson, supra, 80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f                                              II\n                   No Abuse of Discretion in Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion\n        Petitioners contend the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion to\ncompel the cell extraction of DeAvila and force him to attend the deposition. Because a\ntrial court has broad discretion in discovery matters, the issue before us is whether on\nthese facts the trial court was required to order DeAvila’s extraction.\n        Under CDCR policy, controlled force may be used “to gain compliance with a\nlawful order.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3268(a)(4).) Thus, the regulations permit a\ncell extraction for purposes of gaining compliance with a court order. These regulations,\nhowever, do not address who may order that use of force.\n        Petitioners contend the trial judge could order extraction under Penal Code section\n2623 and Code of Civil Procedure section 128. As noted, the trial court had previously\nissued the order for DeAvila to participate in the deposition pursuant to Penal Code\nsection 2623. That section, however, does not provide that the court may also order that\nthe inmate witness be extracted from his cell and brought to the deposition against his\nwill.\n        A trial court may hold a noncompliant witness in contempt for failing to attend a\ndeposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.) The remedy is the same for noncompliance\nwith a grand jury subpoena. “There can be no question that courts have inherent power\nto enforce compliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt. [Citations.] And\nit is essential that courts be able to compel the appearance and testimony of witnesses.\n[Citation.] A grand jury subpoena must command the same respect. [Citation.] Where\ncontempt consists of a refusal to obey a court order to testify at any stage in judicial\nproceedings, the witness may be confined until compliance. [Citations.]” (Shillitani v.\nUnited States (1966) 384 U.S. 364, 370-371 [16 L.Ed.2d 622].) While contempt may\ninclude conditional confinement, we are aware of no authority--and petitioners provide\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fnone-- that permits a court to order the recalcitrant witness be forcibly brought to the\nplace of the deposition (instead of to jail to serve time for contempt).\n       Petitioners contend the extraordinary remedy of compelled cell extraction is\nnecessary in this case because the usual remedy of contempt is ineffectual. The trial\ncourt acknowledged the uselessness of contempt in this case, stating at the hearing that it\ndoes no good to hold in contempt a prisoner serving a 25-year-to-life sentence.\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(4) provides that every court\nshall have the power to “compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process.” “This\nstatute has codified the principle of ‘[t]he inherent power of the trial court to exercise\nreasonable control over litigation before it, as well as the inherent and equitable power to\nachieve justice and prevent misuse of processes lawfully issued . . . .’ [Citation.]”\n(Blueberry Properties, LLC v. Chow (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 1017, 1021.) The court\nmay exercise this power by punishing the failure to appear and participate in a deposition\nas a contempt. (Lund v. Superior Court (1964) 61 Cal.2d 698, 714; Code Civ. Proc.,\n§§ 2023.010, subd. (d), 2023.030, subd. (e).) In such circumstances, “the court has no\npower to proceed in any manner other than as in a contempt.” (Lund, at p. 713.)\n       But assuming Code of Civil Procedure section 128, or the court’s inherent\nauthority to administer judicial proceedings (see People v. Engram (2010) 50 Cal.4th\n1131, 1146), can be construed as granting the court the authority to order prison officials\nto extract DeAvila from his cell to attend the deposition, the question here is whether the\ntrial court abused its discretion by not making that order. We conclude the answer is no.\n       Petitioners contend the order of extraction is necessary to protect their due process\nrights in the civil action. We recognize that due process rights are implicated. “One of\nthe elements of a fair trial is the right to offer relevant and competent evidence on a\nmaterial issue.” (3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (5th ed. 2012) Presentation at Trial, § 3, p. 29.)\nThat due process is implicated, however, does not alone grant a trial court open-ended\nauthority to order prison officials to move inmates about. For example, a court cannot\n\n                                              8\n\fcompel the transfer of an inmate to a civil courtroom. (See Payne v. Superior Court\n(1976) 17 Cal.3d 908, 924 [court “may attempt, through the Department of Corrections,\nto arrange the presence of the prisoner. Except in a few specified circumstances, a court\nhas no statutory authority to command the Department of Corrections to transport a\nprisoner to a civil courtroom”]; Swarthout v. Superior Court (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 701,\n706-707 [“our Supreme Court is of the opinion that trial courts lack the power to transfer\ninmates outside of the situations specifically provided for by statute”]; Pen. Code, § 2621\n[permitting removal of prisoner to court for criminal actions].)\n       Further, here the trial court’s actions are not impeding petitioners’ due process\nrights. It is DeAvila who is refusing to be deposed, and the CDCR is declining to\nforcibly remove him from his cell to go to the location established for the deposition.\nThe court is not denying petitioners the right to depose DeAvila or to present his\ntestimony at trial. Instead, the trial court has already issued an order compelling DeAvila\nto attend and answer questions at a deposition. The record shows he refused to come out\nof his cell because he did not want to participate in the deposition; earlier, DeAvila said\nhe refused to be videotaped. The court cannot compel DeAvila to speak. Due process\nrequires only that a party be allowed the opportunity to be heard--not that he actually be\nheard. (See 3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (5th ed. 2012) Presentation at Trial, § 3, p. 31, citing\nGoldstein v. Goldstein (1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 369 [no denial of due process to deny\ncontinuance where party becomes insane].)\n       Petitioners contend the trial court erred in relying on the risks to correctional\nofficers, DeAvila, and other inmates, as set forth in Roy’s declaration. They contend\nsuch risks are speculative and an actual cell extraction may not be necessary once\nDeAvila is informed it will occur. Petitioners rely on Garcia’s declaration that in his\nexperience 70 percent of inmates voluntarily comply when faced with the use of force.\n       First, we note Garcia’s experience is only with juveniles. Further, we find no error\nin deferring to prison officials on this matter. As the United States Supreme Court has\n\n                                              9\n\fstated: “Prison administrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in\nthe adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to\npreserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security. [Citations.]\n‘Such considerations are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate\nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should\nordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.’ [Citation.] We further observe\nthat, on occasion, prison administrators may be ‘experts’ only by Act of Congress or of a\nstate legislature. But judicial deference is accorded not merely because the administrator\nordinarily will, as a matter of fact in a particular case, have a better grasp of his domain\nthan the reviewing judge, but also because the operation of our correctional facilities is\npeculiarly the province of the Legislative and Executive Branches of our Government,\nnot the Judicial. [Citations.]” (Bell v. Wolfish (1979) 441 U.S. 520, 547-548 [60 L.Ed.2d\n447].)\n         Petitioners contend the trial court neglected to address CDCR’s self-interest in\nwhether DeAvila attends the deposition. CDCR is a defendant in the civil action and it is\nrefusing to procure a witness for the plaintiffs. We have recognized that CDCR does\nhave an apparent conflict of interest. Petitioners, however, have failed to show that\nCDCR is in any manner preventing them from taking DeAvila’s deposition. In fact,\npetitioners admit “[t]here is no evidence that CDCR has interfered with Mr. DeAvila’s\ndeposition.”\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to compel prison officials to\nforcibly remove DeAvila from his cell to attend the deposition. Considerations of the\nchange in DeAvila’s circumstances and housing, the potential risk to his safety and the\nsafety of others, and the disruption to the prison environment all support the trial court’s\ndecision.\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The petition for writ of mandate is denied.

Russell, Sr., and Sandra Reece petition this court for a writ of\nmandate ordering the superior court to issue an order compelling the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to extract material witness and\ninmate, Jerome Sidney DeAvila, from his cell so petitioners can depose him. The trial\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\fcourt denied petitioners’ request for such an order, finding there was no authority for it\nand that the risks of injury and disruption weighed against the order. Although we do not\ncondone CDCR’s refusal to make DeAvila available for deposition by whatever means\nlegally available to it, we conclude the trial court had discretion to decline to order\nextraction, and accordingly deny the writ.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n       In 2013, DeAvila raped and murdered his grandmother Racheal Russell. The\nfollowing year, he was convicted of these crimes and sentenced to 25 years to life in\nprison. Petitioners are the son and daughter of Racheal Russell, the victim; and petitioner\nSandra Reece is also DeAvila’s mother. After the murder, petitioners brought a wrongful\ndeath lawsuit against the State of California, the CDCR, and the County of San Joaquin,\nalleging negligence in the failure to warn of DeAvila’s release from state custody before\nthe murder and the failure to affix an ankle bracelet GPS monitoring device before his\nrelease.\n       The first amended complaint alleged that DeAvila had a lengthy criminal history\nof sex crimes, drugs, and violence, and was on parole at the time of the murder. One\nrequirement of his parole was that he wear a GPS tracking device around his ankle. Due\nto a sex crime conviction, DeAvila was not allowed to go near a school; his\ngrandmother’s house was near a school. The year before the murder, the police arrested\nDeAvila 16 times for violations of parole or other criminal activity; each time they\nreleased him.\n       The complaint alleged that both the state parole officers and the county jail\npersonnel knew, or should have known, that DeAvila often went to his grandmother’s\nhouse. They also knew DeAvila had threatened his grandmother. Three days before the\nmurder, the police arrested DeAvila for violation of parole. He was under the influence\nof drugs or alcohol and had removed his GPS device. County officials again released\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fDeAvila, without notifying his grandmother or reaffixing the GPS device; state parole\nofficials concurred in the decision.\n       Petitioners gave notice that they would take DeAvila’s deposition, first scheduled\nfor January 8, 2015, then for March 2, at the California Health Care Facility in Stockton\nwhere he was housed. On March 2, arrangements were made to take DeAvila’s\ndeposition in a meeting room to accommodate the court reporter, but DeAvila refused to\nparticipate. He refused to come out of his cell. DeAvila had previously told prison\nofficials he would not permit a videotaped deposition.\n       Petitioners believed DeAvila was an “important witness” and “necessary and\nmaterial” to their case. They wanted to question him about what he had told parole and\nCounty officials about his relationship with his grandmother and his feelings and anger\ntowards her. Pursuant to Penal Code section 2623, they obtained a court order requiring\nDeAvila to participate in the deposition and answer all questions.1 Again, De Avila\nrefused to come out of his cell. CDCR declined to forcibly extract him.\n       Petitioners moved to compel CDCR to forcibly extract DeAvila from his cell at\nthe California Health Care Facility. The motion was supported by the declaration of\nGerry Garcia. Garcia had worked at the California Youth Authority for over 25 years,\nretiring as Captain, Chief of Security. He understood DeAvila had a history of refusing\nto come out of his cell and Garcia believed that he had probably been extracted many\ntimes. In Garcia’s experience, 70 percent of the time, an inmate will voluntarily come\nout of the cell when faced with forcible extraction. He saw no reason why DeAvila could\n\n\n\n\n1  Penal Code section 2623 provides in part: “If in a civil action or special proceeding a\nwitness be a prisoner, confined in a state prison within this state, an order for the\nprisoner's examination in the prison by deposition may be made.” This procedure is in\nlieu of the usual deposition subpoena to a non-party witness. (See Code Civ. Proc.,\n§§ 2020.210, 2020.310.)\n\n                                             3\n\fnot be extracted from his cell. Garcia stated, “Inmates are extracted all the time for\ndifferent reasons.”\n       The Warden of Mule Creek State Prison, where DeAvila was then housed,\nopposed the motion, contending there was no authority for compelling an extraction. The\nwarden argued, among other things, that DeAvila was no longer at the California Health\nCare Facility; he was in the general population at Mule Creek State Prison, with minimal\nrestrictions on his movement. This placement made a cell extraction more problematic.\nFurther, there was no guarantee that DeAvila would answer deposition questions after the\nextraction, and any use of force or chemical agents would likely make him less\ncooperative.\n       The opposition was supported by the declaration of R. Roy, a facility captain at\nMule Creek State Prison. Roy detailed the procedure for the involuntary removal of an\ninmate from his cell. Absent an imminent threat to the inmate or staff, any cell extraction\nwould be “controlled” and would require extensive tactical planning, a large amount of\nequipment, and a large number of staff. Before the extraction, staff would assess\nDeAvila’s mental health, medical history, and disciplinary history. A controlled\nextraction is time consuming and could take all day. First, there would be a cool down\nperiod to permit the inmate to comply with the order. This period includes clinical\nintervention by a licensed mental health practitioner and may include dialogue with\nreligious leaders, correctional counselors, or other staff who have developed a rapport\nwith DeAvila. Because DeAvila was in the general population rather than a segregated\nunit, the cell extraction would be more difficult. Because he was receiving mental health\nservices, certain tools such as chemical agents may be prohibited. The actual\nconfrontation could result in harm to DeAvila or staff. A cell extraction disrupts the\nprison environment and may lead to other violence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       The trial court denied the motion to compel a cell extraction. It found no authority\nfor such an order and found that balancing the risk of injury and disruption weighed\nagainst ordering extraction.\n       Petitioners petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to\nvacate its order and to enter a new order granting the motion to compel the cell\nextraction. We issued an order to show cause.\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                         Writ of Mandate and Standard of Review\n       “A writ of mandate will lie to ‘compel the performance of an act which the law\nspecifically enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station’ (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 1085) ‘upon the verified petition of the party beneficially interested,’ in cases ‘where\nthere is not a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course of law.’ (Code\nCiv.

[Citations.] However, the writ will not lie to control discretion\nconferred upon a public officer or agency. [Citations.] Two basic requirements are\nessential to the issuance of the writ: (1) A clear, present and usually ministerial duty upon\nthe part of the respondent [citations]; and (2) a clear, present and beneficial right in the\npetitioner to the performance of that duty [citations].” (People ex rel.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1061 (Johnson).)\n       Here, we review whether the trial court must compel prison authorities to forcibly\nextract DeAvila from his cell to attend a deposition in a civil case to which he is not a\nparty. We issued an order to show cause and proceed to analyze whether CDCR’s refusal\nto forcibly remove DeAvila from his cell for deposition, and the trial court’s subsequent\nrefusal to order CDCR to do so, constituted a violation of the trial court’s clear duty to\nenter the order. We conclude the trial court does not have a clear duty to make the order\nat issue here.\n       We recognize that CDCR is declining to forcibly produce a witness, over which it\nalone has physical control, for deposition in a case in which CDCR is the defendant.\nFurther, CDCR stands accused of misconduct in its failure to monitor defendant, and to\ntake any steps to prevent him from doing harm to his grandmother and to warn her that he\nposed a threat. Despite these compelling facts and circumstances, and CDCR’s apparent\nconflict of interest as it plays the dual roles of defendant’s custodian as well as the entity\nabout whose conduct the plaintiffs seek information, the issue presented--compelling\ndefendant’s custodian to force him to attend a deposition which he has refused to attend--\nboils down to a civil discovery issue.\n       “Management of discovery lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\nConsequently, appellate review of discovery rulings is governed by the abuse of\ndiscretion standard. [Citation.] Where there is a basis for the trial court’s ruling and the\nevidence supports it, a reviewing court will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial\ncourt.

[Citations.]” (Johnson, supra, 80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f                                              II\n                   No Abuse of Discretion in Denying Plaintiffs’ Motion\n        Petitioners contend the trial court abused its discretion in denying their motion to\ncompel the cell extraction of DeAvila and force him to attend the deposition. Because a\ntrial court has broad discretion in discovery matters, the issue before us is whether on\nthese facts the trial court was required to order DeAvila’s extraction.\n        Under CDCR policy, controlled force may be used “to gain compliance with a\nlawful order.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 15, § 3268(a)(4).) Thus, the regulations permit a\ncell extraction for purposes of gaining compliance with a court order. These regulations,\nhowever, do not address who may order that use of force.\n        Petitioners contend the trial judge could order extraction under Penal Code section\n2623 and Code of Civil Procedure section 128. As noted, the trial court had previously\nissued the order for DeAvila to participate in the deposition pursuant to Penal Code\nsection 2623. That section, however, does not provide that the court may also order that\nthe inmate witness be extracted from his cell and brought to the deposition against his\nwill.\n        A trial court may hold a noncompliant witness in contempt for failing to attend a\ndeposition. (Code Civ. Proc., § 2020.240.) The remedy is the same for noncompliance\nwith a grand jury subpoena. “There can be no question that courts have inherent power\nto enforce compliance with their lawful orders through civil contempt. [Citations.] And\nit is essential that courts be able to compel the appearance and testimony of witnesses.\n[Citation.] A grand jury subpoena must command the same respect. [Citation.] Where\ncontempt consists of a refusal to obey a court order to testify at any stage in judicial\nproceedings, the witness may be confined until compliance.

The trial\ncourt acknowledged the uselessness of contempt in this case, stating at the hearing that it\ndoes no good to hold in contempt a prisoner serving a 25-year-to-life sentence.\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 128, subdivision (a)(4) provides that every court\nshall have the power to “compel obedience to its judgments, orders, and process.” “This\nstatute has codified the principle of ‘[t]he inherent power of the trial court to exercise\nreasonable control over litigation before it, as well as the inherent and equitable power to\nachieve justice and prevent misuse of processes lawfully issued . . . .’ [Citation.]”\n(Blueberry Properties, LLC v.

In such circumstances, “the court has no\npower to proceed in any manner other than as in a contempt.” (Lund, at p. 713.)\n       But assuming Code of Civil Procedure section 128, or the court’s inherent\nauthority to administer judicial proceedings (see People v.

We conclude the answer is no.\n       Petitioners contend the order of extraction is necessary to protect their due process\nrights in the civil action. We recognize that due process rights are implicated. “One of\nthe elements of a fair trial is the right to offer relevant and competent evidence on a\nmaterial issue.” (3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (5th ed. 2012) Presentation at Trial, § 3, p. 29.)\nThat due process is implicated, however, does not alone grant a trial court open-ended\nauthority to order prison officials to move inmates about. For example, a court cannot\n\n                                              8\n\fcompel the transfer of an inmate to a civil courtroom. (See Payne v.

Code, § 2621\n[permitting removal of prisoner to court for criminal actions].)\n       Further, here the trial court’s actions are not impeding petitioners’ due process\nrights. It is DeAvila who is refusing to be deposed, and the CDCR is declining to\nforcibly remove him from his cell to go to the location established for the deposition.\nThe court is not denying petitioners the right to depose DeAvila or to present his\ntestimony at trial. Instead, the trial court has already issued an order compelling DeAvila\nto attend and answer questions at a deposition. The record shows he refused to come out\nof his cell because he did not want to participate in the deposition; earlier, DeAvila said\nhe refused to be videotaped. The court cannot compel DeAvila to speak. Due process\nrequires only that a party be allowed the opportunity to be heard--not that he actually be\nheard. (See 3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (5th ed. 2012) Presentation at Trial, § 3, p. 31, citing\nGoldstein v. Goldstein (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2206493\"><a href=\"/opinion/2206493/goldstein-v-goldstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

They contend\nsuch risks are speculative and an actual cell extraction may not be necessary once\nDeAvila is informed it will occur. Petitioners rely on Garcia’s declaration that in his\nexperience 70 percent of inmates voluntarily comply when faced with the use of force.\n       First, we note Garcia’s experience is only with juveniles. Further, we find no error\nin deferring to prison officials on this matter. As the United States Supreme Court has\n\n                                              9\n\fstated: “Prison administrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in\nthe adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to\npreserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security. [Citations.]\n‘Such considerations are peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of\ncorrections officials, and, in the absence of substantial evidence in the record to indicate\nthat the officials have exaggerated their response to these considerations, courts should\nordinarily defer to their expert judgment in such matters.’ [Citation.] We further observe\nthat, on occasion, prison administrators may be ‘experts’ only by Act of Congress or of a\nstate legislature. But judicial deference is accorded not merely because the administrator\nordinarily will, as a matter of fact in a particular case, have a better grasp of his domain\nthan the reviewing judge, but also because the operation of our correctional facilities is\npeculiarly the province of the Legislative and Executive Branches of our Government,\nnot the Judicial. [Citations.]” (Bell v. Wolfish (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547-548 [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

CDCR is a defendant in the civil action and it is\nrefusing to procure a witness for the plaintiffs. We have recognized that CDCR does\nhave an apparent conflict of interest. Petitioners, however, have failed to show that\nCDCR is in any manner preventing them from taking DeAvila’s deposition. In fact,\npetitioners admit “[t]here is no evidence that CDCR has interfered with Mr. DeAvila’s\ndeposition.”\n         The trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to compel prison officials to\nforcibly remove DeAvila from his cell to attend the deposition. Considerations of the\nchange in DeAvila’s circumstances and housing, the potential risk to his safety and the\nsafety of others, and the disruption to the prison environment all support the trial court’s\ndecision.\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n       The petition for writ of mandate is denied.
