FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      Piper, an African-American female, is a Systems Accountant at\n\nNFC’s office in New Orleans, Louisiana.                     She has been employed\n\nthere since June 1974 and in her current position since 1985.                       She\n\nbrought suit pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n\ncodified    in     42    U.S.C.      §   2000(e)   et    seq.,    alleging   that   NFC\n\ndiscriminated against her because of her race, sex, and age,1 and\n\nretaliated against her because of her prior complaints to the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”).\n\n      On August 27, 1980, Piper filed a formal complaint against NFC\n\nalleging that NFC had discriminated against her because race, sex\n\nand in reprisal for her previous EEOC activities. She specifically\n\nalleged that she was not selected for promotion; she was denied\n\ntraining; part of her job duties were transferred to others; she\n\nwas     harassed        by    her    supervisor;     she    was     denied   overtime\n\nassignments;       and       she    received   a   low   performance    rating.      On\n\nSeptember 25, 1985, the EEOC entered a finding of discrimination\n\nwith regard to NFC’s issuance of Piper’s performance appraisal, her\n\nnon-promotion, and the denial of overtime.                       NFC was directed to\n\n\n\n  1\n   Although Piper mentions that she is asserting an age\ndiscrimination claim, that claim is without merit as it was not\nsupported by evidence or argued in the district court or in this\ncourt.\n\n                                               2\n\fpromote Piper to the position of Supervisory Operating Accountant,\n\nreimburse her for the overtime pay she would have received absent\n\ndiscrimination and take appropriate disciplinary action against the\n\ndecision-makers at NFC who were responsible for the discrimination.\n\nSee Piper v. Department of Agriculture, Appeal No. 01832501 (EEOC\n\nOffice of Review and Appeals Sept. 25, 1985).\n\n     Piper filed suit against NFC in federal district court in\n\n1991, alleging that NFC had continued to discriminate against her.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement agreement and an agreed judgment\n\nof dismissal was entered on June 22, 1994.\n\n     Piper filed the present suit in December 1998, alleging that\n\nshe was denied promotions because she is African-American, female\n\nand is perceived as a trouble-maker for filing 32 EEOC complaints\n\nand a law suit against NFC.   She also claimed that she had been\n\ngiven a low performance rating and improper evaluations, denied\n\ncash awards, passed over for promotions while other employees with\n\nlesser qualifications were promoted, evaluated with subjective\n\ncriteria, given fewer job responsibilities, and reassigned to\n\npositions outside her line of work.\n\n     Defendants moved for summary judgment.     The district court\n\nfound that the summary judgment evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to Piper, supported a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nand retaliation as to her failure to promote claims.   Although it\n\nwas unclear whether her allegations of other discriminatory and\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fretaliatory acts by NFC were independent claims, the district court\n\nheld that none of them were ultimate employment actions protected\n\nby Title VII, citing Schackelford v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 190\n\nF.3d 398, 406-07 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n       The   burden        then     shifted          to    NFC       to      articulate      a\n\nnondiscriminatory         reason    for    failing        to   promote         Piper.      NFC\n\nexplained that other candidates were better qualified for the\n\npositions to which Piper applied.                    First, NFC explained that it\n\nawarded a position of Chief of Payroll/Personnel Branch (NFC 97-\n\n004)   to    a   candidate        who    had       nineteen    years      of    supervisory\n\nexperience, seventeen of which were in the payroll/personnel area.\n\nAlso, the selectee had been acting as a branch chief in his\n\nsupervisor’s absence. In 1996, NFC selected another candidate with\n\nnineteen     years    of       relevant    experience          for    the      position     of\n\nSupervisory Systems Accountant (NFC 95-087) who had also been\n\nsection head for the branch for the eight preceding years.                                 The\n\nindividual       chosen    for     the    position        of   Branch        Chief    of   the\n\nAccounting Reconciliation Branch (NFC 94-017) had served as section\n\nchief for six years.            The selecting official for the position of\n\nSupervisory Systems Accountant (NFC 93-044) was an African-American\n\nfemale   who     chose     a    candidate          with   seven      years     of    specific\n\nexperience and strong analytical skills.                          For the position of\n\nAccounting Reporting Branch Chief (NFC 97-064), NFC promoted an\n\nAfrican-American female with eighteen years of experience in the\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fAccounting     Reporting        Branch   and    nine   years   of     supervisory\n\nexperience as a section head.                 A sixteen-year veteran who had\n\nmanaged and supervised the Billings and Collection Branch was\n\nchosen for the position of Billings and Collections Branch Chief.\n\nFinally, NFC stated that an individual with nineteen years of\n\nexperience with the Payroll Accounting Section was chosen to be\n\nhead of Payroll Accounting Section (NFC 97-045).\n\n       The district court determined that NFC’s articulation of non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons for not promoting Piper shifted the burden\n\nback    to   Piper   to     demonstrate       that   the   reasons    given    were\n\npretextual.     After considering Piper’s allegations and summary\n\njudgment evidence, the district court found that the evidence did\n\nnot raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the\n\ndefendant’s non-discriminatory explanations were pretextual. Piper\n\nhad only one year of supervisory experience while each of the other\n\ncandidates served from nine to nineteen years as supervisors.\n\nContrary to Piper’s allegations, NFC selected both women and\n\nAfrican-Americans         for   supervisory      positions.      In    fact,   one\n\nsupervisor who did not select Piper for a promotion is herself an\n\nAfrican-American woman.\n\n       Finally, the district court held that the evidence does not\n\nsupport Piper’s retaliation claim.              The court determined that she\n\nwas not promoted because she was not as well-qualified as other\n\ncandidates, ans she had offered only her belief that she was denied\n\na promotion because of her prior EEOC complaints.                     Even if her\n\n                                          5\n\fhistory of discrimination complaints contributed to the decisions\n\nnot to promote her, the district court held that she cannot\n\nestablish liability for unlawful retaliation if NFC would have\n\ndenied her promotions notwithstanding her complaints to the EEOC,\n\nciting Long v. Eastfield College, 88 F.3d 300, 305 n.4. (5th Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n                               II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n     We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the\n\nsame standards as the district court.              Benningfield v. City of\n\nHouston, 157 F.3d 369, 374 (5th Cir. 1998).                    If the summary\n\njudgment evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law, the summary judgment entered by the district\n\ncourt will be affirmed.    See FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c).\n\nB. Proof of Past Discrimination\n\n     Piper contends on appeal that the district court erred in by\n\nfailing to properly consider NFC’s past discrimination against her.\n\n     First,   Piper   argues    that       the   Title   VII   burden-shifting\n\nconstruct articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792, 802 (1973), and Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine,\n\n450 U.S. 248, 249-50 (1981), must be modified in this case because\n\nNFC had discriminated against her in the past.             Piper reasons that\n\nonce she made out her prima facie case and proved that NFC had\n\n                                       6\n\fpreviously discriminated against her, the burden shifted to NFC to\n\nprove by clear and convincing evidence (rather than preponderance\n\nof the evidence) that its decisions regarding her employment were\n\nmotivated by legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons.             For this\n\nproposition, she relies on a line of cases stemming from Keyes v.\n\nSchool District No. 1, 413 U.S. 189 (1973).         In Keyes, the Supreme\n\nCourt “thrust upon the School Board the burden of justifying its\n\nconduct by clear and convincing evidence” because the school had a\n\nhistory of segregation coupled with the discharge of a large number\n\nof African-American teachers incident to desegregation.            Id. at\n\n209.   The Fifth Circuit has required local boards of education to\n\nmeet the stringent Keyes evidentiary burden when plaintiffs have\n\nproved an immediate past history of racial discrimination in a\n\nrecently desegregated school district.       See Lee v. Conecuh County\n\nBoard of Education, 634 F.2d 959, 963 (5th Cir. 1981); see also Lee\n\nv. Washington County Board of Education, 625 F.2d 1235, 1237 (5th\n\nCir. 1980).   Although this circuit has imposed a similar burden in\n\nTitle VII class action cases, see Baxter v. Savannah Sugar Refining\n\nCorp., 495 F.2d 437 (5th Cir. 1974), that burden is not applicable\n\nin the context of individual discrimination cases.\n\n       Keyes and its progeny shifted the burden of persuasion in\n\ncases where the defendant had a history of discrimination and where\n\nsignificant   numerical   disparities     existed    in   the   employer’s\n\ntreatment of minority employees.       Piper’s case does not fall into\n\n                                   7\n\fthat category of cases.            Piper alleges, instead, that NFC has a\n\nhistory of discriminating against her personally.                  The Supreme\n\nCourt has consistently held that the ultimate burden of persuading\n\nthe    trier   of   fact    that    the   defendant     discriminated    against\n\nplaintiff in an individual, disparate-treatment case remains at all\n\ntimes with the plaintiff.          Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.      We therefore\n\nfind that the district court did not err in rejecting Piper’s Keyes\n\nanalysis.\n\n       In related grounds of error, Piper complains that the district\n\ncourt    failed     to     adequately     take   into    consideration    NFC’s\n\npredisposition      toward    discrimination     which    she   established   by\n\nproffering evidence that NFC had previously discriminated against\n\nher.    As the district court noted, Piper did not offer evidence\n\nwhich refuted the district court’s conclusion that the individuals\n\nwho were selected for promotions were better qualified for the\n\npositions than she was. See Nichols v. Loral Vought Systems Corp.,\n\n81 F.3d 38, 42 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that in order to rebut\n\nemployer’s articulated non-discriminatory reason that plaintiff was\n\nnot as well-qualified as the workers that employer had selected,\n\nplaintiff must offer sufficiently specific basis for claim that he\n\nwas in fact the better-qualified worker).                Moreover, one of the\n\npromoted employees was African-American, another was female, and\n\none of the selecting officials in another promotion was an African-\n\nAmerican female.         We find no error in the district court’s view of\n\n\n                                          8\n\fthe evidence.\n\nC. Interim change in Title VII law\n\n     The district court filed its Order and Reasons on June 7,\n\n2000, and the Final Judgment on June 14, 2000.    In the interim, on\n\nJune 12, 2000, the Supreme Court resolved a split among the\n\ncircuits on the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law where a plaintiff’s case consists only\n\nof a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas and sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable trier or fact to reject the defendant’s\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for its decision.     See\n\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 140\n\n(2000).   The Supreme Court held that such evidence is sufficient\n\nfor a plaintiff to withstand a grant of judgment as a matter of law\n\nin favor of the defendant.   Id. at 148.   Even if the district court\n\nhad applied the new Reeves standard, Piper’s case cannot survive\n\nsummary judgment because she did not present evidence sufficient\n\nfor a reasonable trier of fact to reject NFC’s nondiscriminatory\n\nexplanation for its decisions.\n\nD. Actionable Adverse Employment Actions\n\n     Piper next alleges that the district erred by focusing only\n\non NFC’s failure to promote her and denying her relief on her\n\nclaims of discrimination and retaliation related to performance\n\nevaluations, cash awards, assignment of duties, and supervision by\n\na lower-grade employee.      Piper identifies no evidence, and our\n\n\n                                  9\n\freview of the record has uncovered none, that she suffered any\n\nactionable employment actions other than NFC’s failure to promote\n\nher.\n\n       Piper contends in a related argument that she has alleged\n\ntwelve instances of tangible employment action in addition to the\n\nfour that the district court examined in detail.       Having examined\n\nthe record, we agree with the district court that the summary\n\njudgment evidence presents no genuine issue of material fact\n\nconcerning   Piper’s   additional   allegations   of   “non-promotional\n\nclaims,” which consist of her twelve EEOC complaints that did not\n\npertain to NFC’s failure to promote her.\n\n                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in\n\ndenying Piper relief on her claims for relief based on any of the\n\nalleged employment decisions, and we affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment for NFC.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\f",

Department of Agriculture, Appeal No. 01832501 (EEOC\n\nOffice of Review and Appeals Sept. 25, 1985).\n\n     Piper filed suit against NFC in federal district court in\n\n1991, alleging that NFC had continued to discriminate against her.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement agreement and an agreed judgment\n\nof dismissal was entered on June 22, 1994.\n\n     Piper filed the present suit in December 1998, alleging that\n\nshe was denied promotions because she is African-American, female\n\nand is perceived as a trouble-maker for filing 32 EEOC complaints\n\nand a law suit against NFC.   She also claimed that she had been\n\ngiven a low performance rating and improper evaluations, denied\n\ncash awards, passed over for promotions while other employees with\n\nlesser qualifications were promoted, evaluated with subjective\n\ncriteria, given fewer job responsibilities, and reassigned to\n\npositions outside her line of work.\n\n     Defendants moved for summary judgment.     The district court\n\nfound that the summary judgment evidence, taken in the light most\n\nfavorable to Piper, supported a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nand retaliation as to her failure to promote claims.   Although it\n\nwas unclear whether her allegations of other discriminatory and\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fretaliatory acts by NFC were independent claims, the district court\n\nheld that none of them were ultimate employment actions protected\n\nby Title VII, citing Schackelford v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18788\"><a href=\"/opinion/18788/shackelford-v-deloitte-touche-ll/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406-07 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n       The   burden        then     shifted          to    NFC       to      articulate      a\n\nnondiscriminatory         reason    for    failing        to   promote         Piper.      NFC\n\nexplained that other candidates were better qualified for the\n\npositions to which Piper applied.                    First, NFC explained that it\n\nawarded a position of Chief of Payroll/Personnel Branch (NFC 97-\n\n004)   to    a   candidate        who    had       nineteen    years      of    supervisory\n\nexperience, seventeen of which were in the payroll/personnel area.\n\nAlso, the selectee had been acting as a branch chief in his\n\nsupervisor’s absence. In 1996, NFC selected another candidate with\n\nnineteen     years    of       relevant    experience          for    the      position     of\n\nSupervisory Systems Accountant (NFC 95-087) who had also been\n\nsection head for the branch for the eight preceding years.                                 The\n\nindividual       chosen    for     the    position        of   Branch        Chief    of   the\n\nAccounting Reconciliation Branch (NFC 94-017) had served as section\n\nchief for six years.            The selecting official for the position of\n\nSupervisory Systems Accountant (NFC 93-044) was an African-American\n\nfemale   who     chose     a    candidate          with   seven      years     of    specific\n\nexperience and strong analytical skills.                          For the position of\n\nAccounting Reporting Branch Chief (NFC 97-064), NFC promoted an\n\nAfrican-American female with eighteen years of experience in the\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fAccounting     Reporting        Branch   and    nine   years   of     supervisory\n\nexperience as a section head.                 A sixteen-year veteran who had\n\nmanaged and supervised the Billings and Collection Branch was\n\nchosen for the position of Billings and Collections Branch Chief.\n\nFinally, NFC stated that an individual with nineteen years of\n\nexperience with the Payroll Accounting Section was chosen to be\n\nhead of Payroll Accounting Section (NFC 97-045).\n\n       The district court determined that NFC’s articulation of non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons for not promoting Piper shifted the burden\n\nback    to   Piper   to     demonstrate       that   the   reasons    given    were\n\npretextual.     After considering Piper’s allegations and summary\n\njudgment evidence, the district court found that the evidence did\n\nnot raise a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the\n\ndefendant’s non-discriminatory explanations were pretextual. Piper\n\nhad only one year of supervisory experience while each of the other\n\ncandidates served from nine to nineteen years as supervisors.\n\nContrary to Piper’s allegations, NFC selected both women and\n\nAfrican-Americans         for   supervisory      positions.      In    fact,   one\n\nsupervisor who did not select Piper for a promotion is herself an\n\nAfrican-American woman.\n\n       Finally, the district court held that the evidence does not\n\nsupport Piper’s retaliation claim.              The court determined that she\n\nwas not promoted because she was not as well-qualified as other\n\ncandidates, ans she had offered only her belief that she was denied\n\na promotion because of her prior EEOC complaints.                     Even if her\n\n                                          5\n\fhistory of discrimination complaints contributed to the decisions\n\nnot to promote her, the district court held that she cannot\n\nestablish liability for unlawful retaliation if NFC would have\n\ndenied her promotions notwithstanding her complaints to the EEOC,\n\nciting Long v.

City of\n\nHouston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758352\"><a href=\"/opinion/758352/debbie-l-benningfield-peggy-frankhouser-pamela-m-grant-intervenor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (5th Cir. 1998).                    If the summary\n\njudgment evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law, the summary judgment entered by the district\n\ncourt will be affirmed.    See FED.R.CIV.P. 56(c).\n\nB. Proof of Past Discrimination\n\n     Piper contends on appeal that the district court erred in by\n\nfailing to properly consider NFC’s past discrimination against her.\n\n     First,   Piper   argues    that       the   Title   VII   burden-shifting\n\nconstruct articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (1973), and Texas Dep’t of Community Affairs v. Burdine,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249-50 (1981), must be modified in this case because\n\nNFC had discriminated against her in the past.             Piper reasons that\n\nonce she made out her prima facie case and proved that NFC had\n\n                                       6\n\fpreviously discriminated against her, the burden shifted to NFC to\n\nprove by clear and convincing evidence (rather than preponderance\n\nof the evidence) that its decisions regarding her employment were\n\nmotivated by legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons.             For this\n\nproposition, she relies on a line of cases stemming from Keyes v.\n\nSchool District No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108844\"><a href=\"/opinion/108844/keyes-v-school-dist-no-1-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).         In Keyes, the Supreme\n\nCourt “thrust upon the School Board the burden of justifying its\n\nconduct by clear and convincing evidence” because the school had a\n\nhistory of segregation coupled with the discharge of a large number\n\nof African-American teachers incident to desegregation.            Id. at\n\n209.   The Fifth Circuit has required local boards of education to\n\nmeet the stringent Keyes evidentiary burden when plaintiffs have\n\nproved an immediate past history of racial discrimination in a\n\nrecently desegregated school district.       See Lee v. Conecuh County\n\nBoard of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"384401\"><a href=\"/opinion/384401/26-fair-emplpraccas-1251-25-empl-prac-dec-p-31520-anthony-t-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">959</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 963 (5th Cir. 1981); see also Lee\n\nv.

Although this circuit has imposed a similar burden in\n\nTitle VII class action cases, see Baxter v. Savannah Sugar Refining\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318517\"><a href=\"/opinion/318517/8-fair-emplpraccas-84-7-empl-prac-dec-p-9426-8-empl-prac-dec-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1974), that burden is not applicable\n\nin the context of individual discrimination cases.\n\n       Keyes and its progeny shifted the burden of persuasion in\n\ncases where the defendant had a history of discrimination and where\n\nsignificant   numerical   disparities     existed    in   the   employer’s\n\ntreatment of minority employees.       Piper’s case does not fall into\n\n                                   7\n\fthat category of cases.            Piper alleges, instead, that NFC has a\n\nhistory of discriminating against her personally.                  The Supreme\n\nCourt has consistently held that the ultimate burden of persuading\n\nthe    trier   of   fact    that    the   defendant     discriminated    against\n\nplaintiff in an individual, disparate-treatment case remains at all\n\ntimes with the plaintiff.          Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256.      We therefore\n\nfind that the district court did not err in rejecting Piper’s Keyes\n\nanalysis.\n\n       In related grounds of error, Piper complains that the district\n\ncourt    failed     to     adequately     take   into    consideration    NFC’s\n\npredisposition      toward    discrimination     which    she   established   by\n\nproffering evidence that NFC had previously discriminated against\n\nher.    As the district court noted, Piper did not offer evidence\n\nwhich refuted the district court’s conclusion that the individuals\n\nwho were selected for promotions were better qualified for the\n\npositions than she was. See Nichols v. Loral Vought Systems Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715861\"><a href=\"/opinion/715861/70-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1027-68-empl-prac-dec-p-44050-ellis-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that in order to rebut\n\nemployer’s articulated non-discriminatory reason that plaintiff was\n\nnot as well-qualified as the workers that employer had selected,\n\nplaintiff must offer sufficiently specific basis for claim that he\n\nwas in fact the better-qualified worker).                Moreover, one of the\n\npromoted employees was African-American, another was female, and\n\none of the selecting officials in another promotion was an African-\n\nAmerican female.         We find no error in the district court’s view of\n\n\n                                          8\n\fthe evidence.\n\nC. Interim change in Title VII law\n\n     The district court filed its Order and Reasons on June 7,\n\n2000, and the Final Judgment on June 14, 2000.    In the interim, on\n\nJune 12, 2000, the Supreme Court resolved a split among the\n\ncircuits on the issue of whether a defendant is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law where a plaintiff’s case consists only\n\nof a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas and sufficient\n\nevidence for a reasonable trier or fact to reject the defendant’s\n\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for its decision.     See\n\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140\n\n(2000).   The Supreme Court held that such evidence is sufficient\n\nfor a plaintiff to withstand a grant of judgment as a matter of law\n\nin favor of the defendant.   Id. at 148.   Even if the district court\n\nhad applied the new Reeves standard, Piper’s case cannot survive\n\nsummary judgment because she did not present evidence sufficient\n\nfor a reasonable trier of fact to reject NFC’s nondiscriminatory\n\nexplanation for its decisions.\n\nD. Actionable Adverse Employment Actions\n\n     Piper next alleges that the district erred by focusing only\n\non NFC’s failure to promote her and denying her relief on her\n\nclaims of discrimination and retaliation related to performance\n\nevaluations, cash awards, assignment of duties, and supervision by\n\na lower-grade employee.      Piper identifies no evidence, and our\n\n\n                                  9\n\freview of the record has uncovered none, that she suffered any\n\nactionable employment actions other than NFC’s failure to promote\n\nher.\n\n       Piper contends in a related argument that she has alleged\n\ntwelve instances of tangible employment action in addition to the\n\nfour that the district court examined in detail.       Having examined\n\nthe record, we agree with the district court that the summary\n\njudgment evidence presents no genuine issue of material fact\n\nconcerning   Piper’s   additional   allegations   of   “non-promotional\n\nclaims,” which consist of her twelve EEOC complaints that did not\n\npertain to NFC’s failure to promote her.\n\n                          III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in\n\ndenying Piper relief on her claims for relief based on any of the\n\nalleged employment decisions, and we affirm the entry of summary\n\njudgment for NFC.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    10\n\f</pre>",
