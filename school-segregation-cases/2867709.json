Those appeals were from orders o\n\nbankruptcy court which 1) denied the Trustees' Renewed Motion for adequate protecti\n\n2) confirmed Continental's revised second amended joint plan of reorganization, and\n\ndenied the Trustees' motion for the establishment of a cash deposit of $123,479,287\n\nessence, the Appellant Trustees seek payment for an asserted administrative claim o\n\napproximately $117 million against the reorganized company.    The Appellee, Continen\n\nAirlines, Inc., defends the district court's mootness ruling and argues, in the\n\nalternative, that the underlying rulings of the bankruptcy court were correct as a\n\nof law and fact.\n\n                                            I.\n\n                              FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n          Continental filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on December 3, 1990.\n\nAppellant Trustees serve as successor Collateral and Series Trustees for certificat\n\nholders who had provided Continental with operating capital.   The certificates were\n\nsecured at the time of Continental's petition by a pool of 29 commercial aircraft w\n\nengines, and 81 additional jet engines which, we were advised, serviced about one-t\n\n\n                                            3\n\fContinental's operating fleet.   Under the Bankruptcy Code, the debtor in possession\n\nhas most of the rights, powers, functions and duties of a trustee, see 11 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1107(a), \"may use property of the estate in the ordinary course of business without\n\nor a hearing.\"   11 U.S.C. ยง 363(c)(1).\n\n          Section 363(e) provides:\n          Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, at any time, on requ\n          an entity that has an interest in property used . . . by the [debtor in\n          possession], the court, with or without a hearing, shall prohibit or cond\n          such use . . . as is necessary to provide adequate protection of such int\n\n\n11 U.S.C. ยง 363(e).\n\n          On February 21, 1991, First Fidelity Bank of New Jersey, predecessor to\nNationsBank as Collateral Trustee, filed a motion along with many other aircraft le\n\nand financiers alleging, inter alia, a decline in the value of the collateral and s\n\nadequate protection under section 363(e).   First Fidelity later withdrew from this\n\nbut on June 28, 1991 it, and the predecessors of the other Appellant Trustees, file\n\nmotion seeking similar relief.   The bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nmotion from September 3 through September 6, 1991 limited to the Trustees' assertio\n\nthey were entitled to adequate protection payments as a result of the collateral's\n\npetition decline in market value.\n\n          Continental argued, inter alia, that because the Trustees had not filed a\nfor relief from the automatic stay, they were not entitled to an award of adequate\n\nprotection under section 363(e).    The bankruptcy court ruled on the Trustees' motio\n\nAugust 27, 1992, rejecting that argument but finding as a fact, based on the \"Blue\n\na publication issued by a company that appraises aircraft, that the market value of\n\ncollateral had not declined during the period at issue in the motion.   In re Contin\n\nAirlines, Inc., 146 B.R. 536 (Bankr. D. Del. 1992) [hereinafter Continental I].\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f          On August 14, 1992, approximately two weeks before the opinion in Contine\n\nwas issued, the Trustees filed a motion under section 362(d) of the Bankruptcy Code\n\nlift the automatic stay (\"Lift-Stay Motion\").    See 11 U.S.C. ยง 362(d).   This sectio\n\npermits a creditor to move for relief from the automatic stay of delineated activit\n\nsuch as repossession of collateral, effected by section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Co\n\n          On September 14, 1992, the Trustees also filed a renewed motion for adequ\n\nprotection for alleged decline in the collateral's value for the period after Septe\n\n1991, when the original 1991 motion was argued (\"Renewed Motion\").    There were vari\n\nhearings on the Renewed Motion between November 3, 1992 and February 5, 1993.     Towa\n\nend of that period, the Trustees filed a motion dated January 29, 1993, asking the\n\nbankruptcy court to establish a cash deposit of some $123 million, of which $117 mi\n\nwas attributable to alleged market decline, to preserve what the Trustees claimed w\n\nadministrative priority status of the Trustees' adequate protection claim if Contin\n\nemerged from bankruptcy as a reorganized debtor (\"Deposit Motion\").\n\n          During this period efforts to reorganize the debtor continued.     On Novemb\n\n1992 Continental entered into an Investment Agreement under which the Investors (Ai\n\nPartners, L.P. and Air Canada) agreed and committed to an investment of $450 millio\n\nthe reorganized entity under a complex arrangement and subject to certain condition\n\nApp. at 391 et seq.   One of those conditions relevant to this proceeding was a limi\n\non the amount and nature of liabilities and administrative expense claims required\n\nassumed by or attributable to the reorganized company.    App. at 408.   On January 13\n\nContinental filed a second amended joint plan of reorganization (\"Plan\") which refe\n\nthat Investment Agreement.   The Plan provided, inter alia, for assumption of \"allow\n\nadministrative claims\" by the reorganized Continental. App. at 656.\n\n          The confirmation hearing was held for a number of days during the period\n\n16, 1993 through April 16, 1993.   The parties reached a settlement on April 12 conc\n\n\n                                             5\n\fadequate protection due to use and/or maintenance of the collateral by Continental,\n\nissue relating to use decline (the impairment in value attributable to the use of t\n\ncollateral by the debtor in possession) is before us.       The parties did not settle t\n\nTrustees' adequate protection claims based on decline in market value.\n\n          At the conclusion of the confirmation hearing on April 16, 1993, the bank\n\ncourt denied the Deposit Motion and the Renewed Motion.       In a published opinion, th\n\nheld that it was necessary for the Trustees to have sought relief from the automati\n\nto be entitled to adequate protection for market value decline; that therefore the\n\nTrustees were not entitled to adequate protection due to market decline until after\n\ndate of their Lift-Stay Motion, i.e. August 14, 1992; and that no decline in the ma\n\nvalue of the collateral had taken place since that date.       In re Continental Airline\n\nInc., 154 B.R. 176 (Bankr. D. Del. 1993) [hereinafter Continental II].       Also on Apr\n\n1993, the bankruptcy court signed the Confirmation Order.       The court made a series\n\ndetailed findings of fact and conclusions of law underlying the Confirmation Order\n\nwill be referred to throughout this opinion when pertinent.\n\n          On April 20, 1993 the Trustees filed three notices of appeal to the distr\n\ncourt from the bankruptcy court's denial of the Renewed Motion for Adequate Protect\n\nits denial of the Deposit Motion, and its order confirming the Plan.       Two days late\n\nTrustees filed a motion for a partial stay of the consummation of the Plan (\"Condit\n\nStay Motion\"), but filed that motion in the district court, which referred them to\n\nbankruptcy court.   On April 26, 1993, the Trustees filed a stay request in the bank\n\ncourt.   Because the bankruptcy judge was not available, the hearing on the motion w\n\nthe next day in the district court, which ruled that the Trustees were likely to pr\n\non appeal but denied the stay because the Trustees were \"unable to post a bond\n\nsatisfactory to the Court.\" App. at 1755-56.       With no stay impeding implementation\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fPlan which had now been confirmed, the Investors proceeded to close the transaction\n\nmaking their promised investment.\n\n          On May 6, 1993 Continental filed a motion in the district court to dismis\n\nTrustees' appeals as moot, which the district court granted on December 30, 1993.\n\nTrustees filed a motion for rehearing and reconsideration in light of the decision\n\nFrito-Lay, Inc. v. LTV Steel Co., Inc. (In re Chateaugay Corp.), 10 F.3d 944 (2d Ci\n\n1993) [hereinafter Chateaugay II], which the court denied.   The Trustees filed a ti\n\nnotice of appeal.   We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 158(d).\n\n                                            II.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n                                             A.\n\n          The merits issues on which the parties divide present interesting and\n\nchallenging questions of first impression for this court, and some appear not to ha\n\ndecided by any appellate court.   The Trustees argue that neither the Bankruptcy\n\nCode nor any reliable precedent supports the bankruptcy court's holding that a cred\n\nmust file a motion to lift the automatic stay as a prerequisite to seeking adequate\n\nprotection.   They argue that this is a matter of law that this court can decide de\n\neven though the district court did not reach the issue. They further argue that the\n\nbankruptcy court's finding that there was no diminution in the market value of the\n\nTrustees' collateral after they filed their Lift-Stay Motion was clearly erroneous.\n\nFinally, they argue that the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law in denying t\n\nmotion for the establishment of a cash deposit.\n\n          Not surprisingly, Continental, as appellee, defends both the bankruptcy c\n\nlegal determination that the Trustees could not assert adequate protection claims f\n\nalleged market value decline during the period before they moved for relief from th\n\nautomatic stay and its factual conclusion that there had been no substantial declin\n\n\n                                             7\n\fthe value of the collateral since the Lift-Stay Motion was filed.    Finally, it argu\n\nin any event the Trustees could not recover for adequate protection because the val\n\nthe collateral did not decline below its value on the petition date, which Continen\n\ncontends is the relevant measure.\n\n          We would reach these issues only if we were satisfied that the district c\n\nerred in holding that the Trustees' appeals to it were moot, a decision as to which\n\nparties vigorously disagree.   Mootness vel non of the appeals before the district c\n\nclosely related to, if not indistinguishable from, the question whether the appeal\n\ncourt is moot, an issue which Continental alludes to in its brief.   For convenience\n\nwill refer to mootness in the district court unless we state otherwise.\n\n          Continental does not contend that the appeals to the district court or to\n\nwere moot in the constitutional sense, implicating the case or controversy requirem\n\nArticle III, ยง1.   See, e.g., Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U.S. 395, 401-02 (1975). This\n\na situation analogous to those where the appeals became moot because the law at iss\n\nrepealed, see Diffenderfer v. Central Baptist Church, 404 U.S. 412, 414-15 (1972);\n\nsubject of the election campaign controversy was no longer a candidate, see Golden\n\nZwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 109-10 (1969); or the railroad whose application for tariff\n\ncontested withdrew that application, see A.L. Mechling Barge Lines, Inc. v. United\n\n368 U.S. 324, 329-30 (1961).\n\n          Indeed, as the Supreme Court has recently explained, an appeal is moot in\n\nconstitutional sense only if events have taken place during the pendency of the app\n\nthat make it \"impossible for the court to grant 'any effectual relief whatever.'\"\n\nof Scientology v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, ___, 113 S. Ct. 447, 449 (1992) (quoti\n\nMills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895)).   An appeal is not moot \"merely because a\n\ncannot restore the parties to the status quo ante.   Rather, when a court can fashio\n\nform of meaningful relief,' even if it only partially redresses the grievances of t\n\n\n                                             8\n\fprevailing party, the appeal is not moot.\"   RTC v. Swedeland Dev. Group, Inc. (In r\n\nSwedeland Dev. Group, Inc.), 16 F.3d 552, 560 (3d Cir. 1994) (in banc) (quoting Chu\n\nScientology, 113 S. Ct. at 450). Thus, in Isidor Paiewonsky Assocs. v. Sharp Proper\n\nInc., 998 F.2d 145, 152 (3d Cir. 1993), we concluded that because we could impose a\n\none of the remedies enumerated by the appellant, and thereby provide it \"some effec\n\nrelief,\" the appeal was not moot.   That is not the issue in this case.\n\n          Instead, Continental invokes the broader interpretation of mootness appli\n\nbankruptcy cases, often referred to as \"equitable mootness.\"   See, e.g., Manges v.\n\nSeattle-First Nat'l Bank (In re Manges), 29 F.3d 1034, 1038-39 (5th Cir. 1994), cer\n\ndenied, 115 S. Ct. 1105 (1995); In re Specialty Equip. Cos., 3 F.3d 1043, 1048 (7th\n\n1993);   Official Comm. of Unsecured\n\nCreditors of LTV Aerospace & Defense Co. v. Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors o\n\nSteel Co. (In re Chateaugay Corp.), 988 F.2d 322, 325 (2d Cir. 1993) [hereinafter\n\nChateaugay I]; Rochman v. Northeast Utils. Serv. Group (In re Public Serv. Co.), 96\n\n469, 471-72 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 304 (1992); First Union Real Estat\n\nEquity & Mortgage Invs. v. Club Assocs. (In re Club Assocs.), 956 F.2d 1065, 1069 (\n\nCir. 1992); Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central T\n\nInc., 841 F.2d 92, 95-96 (4th Cir. 1988); In re AOV Indus., 792 F.2d 1140, 1147 (D.\n\n1986); Trone v. Roberts Farms, Inc. (In re Roberts Farms, Inc.), 652 F.2d 793, 796-\n\nCir. 1981).   Under this widely recognized and accepted doctrine, the courts have he\n\n\"[a]n appeal should . . . be dismissed as moot when, even though effective relief c\n\nconceivably be fashioned, implementation of that relief would be inequitable.\"   Cha\n\nI, 988 F.2d at 325.\n\n          In a trenchant discussion of the issue in a recent decision of the Sevent\n\nCircuit, the court noted that denominating the doctrine as \"equitable mootness\" is\n\nmisleading. In re UNR Indus., 20 F.3d 766, 769 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct.\n\n\n                                             9\n\f(1994).   Judge Easterbrook, writing for the court, stated:   \"[t]here is a big diffe\n\nbetween inability to alter the outcome (real mootness) and unwillingness to alter t\n\noutcome ('equitable mootness').   Using one word for two different concepts breeds\n\nconfusion.\" Id. (emphasis in original).   Thus, although the discussions and applica\n\nof the concept of \"mootness\" in bankruptcy cases by that court had previously encom\n\nwhat is referred to elsewhere as \"equitable mootness,\" see Specialty Equip., 3 F.3d\n\n1048; In re Andreuccetti, 975 F.2d 413, 418 (7th Cir. 1992), the court in UNR Indus\n\nstated it would now \"banish 'equitable mootness' from the (local) lexicon.\" 20 F.3d\n\n769.   Instead, the court continued, \"[w]e ask not whether this case is moot, 'equit\n\nor otherwise, but whether it is prudent to upset the plan of reorganization at this\n\ndate.\"    Id.\n\n           These \"equitable\" or \"prudential\" considerations focus on \"concerns uniqu\n\nbankruptcy proceedings.\"   Manges, 29 F.3d at 1038.   Whether termed \"equitable mootn\n\na prudence doctrine, we see no reason why this court should part company with our s\n\ncircuits in their adoption of this doctrine.    If limited in scope and cautiously ap\n\nthis doctrine provides a vehicle whereby the court can prevent substantial harm to\n\nnumerous parties.\n\n           The Trustees have not challenged the viability of the doctrine of equitab\n\nmootness or application of prudential considerations in bankruptcy cases, nor have\n\ncited to a case in any circuit that rejects the concept.    Instead, they rely most h\n\non a decision of the Second Circuit holding that even though the reorganization pla\n\nthe bankrupt LTV Corporation had been confirmed, the appeal of tax lessors challeng\n\nplan's failure to give their claims administrative priority was not moot.    See Chat\n\nII, 10 F.3d 944 (2d Cir. 1993). Significantly, the court in Chateaugay II did not q\n\nwith the doctrine, merely its application in that case.    In fact, in RTC v. Best Pr\n\nCo. (In re Best Prod. Co.), 68 F.3d 26, 29 (2d Cir. 1995), a more recent case from\n\n\n                                               10\n\fSecond Circuit, the court once again emphasized the language in Chateaugay I that e\n\nthough an appeal may not be moot in the sense of Article III of the Constitution, i\n\nbe deemed moot in bankruptcy cases because of \"equitable considerations.\"\n\n            We have generally stated that we exercise plenary\n\nreview of a district court's decision on mootness.   See Northeast Women's Ctr., Inc\n\nMcMonagle, 939 F.2d 57, 61 (3d Cir. 1991); International Bhd. of Boilermakers v. Ke\n\n815 F.2d 912, 914 (3d Cir. 1987).    In those cases our focus was on constitutional\n\nmootness.   It is surprising, but we have not seen any discussion of our standard of\n\nof a district court's determination that a bankruptcy appeal to it was moot for equ\n\nor prudential reasons.    Under ordinary review principles, we would review that deci\n\nfor abuse of discretion.    A particular case may also raise legal and/or factual iss\n\ninterspersed with the prudential ones, and then the applicable review standard, ple\n\nclearly erroneous, would apply.\n\n\n\n                                              B.\n\n            Factors that have been considered by courts in determining whether it wou\n\nequitable or prudential to reach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal include (1) whet\n\nreorganization plan has been substantially consummated, (2) whether a stay has been\n\nobtained, (3) whether the relief requested would affect the rights of parties not b\n\nthe court, (4) whether the relief requested would affect the success of the plan, a\n\nthe public policy of affording finality to bankruptcy judgments.    See Manges, 29 F.\n\n1039; Rochman, 963 F.2d at 471-72.\n\n            The foremost consideration has been whether the reorganization plan has b\n\nsubstantially consummated, especially where the reorganization involves intricate\n\ntransactions, see Rochman, 963 F.2d at 473-74 (performance under plan involved \"num\n\ncomplex arrangements\"); Roberts Farms, 652 F.2d at 797 (plan involved \"many intrica\n\n\n                                              11\n\finvolved transactions\" and reversal of plan's confirmation \"would knock the props o\n\nunder\" such transactions and \"create an unmanageable, uncontrollable situation for\n\nBankruptcy Court\"), or where outside investors have relied on the confirmation of t\n\nplan, see Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039 (equitable mootness \"protects the interests of no\n\nadverse third parties who are not before the reviewing court but who have acted in\n\nreliance upon the plan as implemented\"); UNR Indus., 20 F.3d at 770 (\"[b]y protecti\n\ninterests of persons who acquire assets in reliance on a plan of reorganization, a\n\nincreases the price the estate can realize ex ante, and thus produces benefits for\n\ncreditors in the aggregate\"); Rochman, 963 F.2d at 474 (reorganization involved $1.\n\nbillion in financing from 100,000 sources); Club Assocs., 956 F.2d at 1070 (\"a numb\n\ninvestors, who were not parties to this case, had committed new funds to the 'reeme\n\nClub' with the expectation of receiving a preferred return on their investments\").\n\n          \"Substantial consummation\" is defined in the Bankruptcy Code as: \"(A) tra\n\nof all or substantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred;\n\nassumption by the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of the bu\n\nor of the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the\n\nand (C) commencement of distribution under the plan.\"   11 U.S.C. ยง 1101(2).   In suc\n\ninstances, the strong public interest in the finality of bankruptcy reorganizations\n\nparticularly compelling.\n\n          The district court dismissed the appeals to it as moot based on the concl\n\nset forth in its opinion dated December 30, 1993, that substantial consummation of\n\nPlan had occurred, the Investors had already made their $450 million investment int\n\nreorganized entity, all elements of the Plan, except distributions to the unsecured\n\ncreditors, had been completed, and a reversal of the order confirming the Plan like\n\nwould put Continental back into bankruptcy.

They suggest\n\nas their object is not to disturb the reorganization, but only to get payment from\n\nreorganized Continental for their adequate protection claim measured by the market\n\ndecline of the collateral during bankruptcy, the line of cases upon which Continent\n\nrelies is inapplicable.    We cannot agree, because the rejection of the Trustees' cl\n\nthe bankruptcy court was inextricably intertwined with the implementation of the\n\nreorganization.    See AOV Indus., 792 F.2d at 1148 (to evaluate mootness, court must\n\n\"scrutinize each individual claim, testing the feasibility of granting the relief a\n\nits potential impact on the reorganization scheme as a whole\").    Thus, the Trustees\n\navoid the effect of the substantial consummation of the reorganization plan so read\n\n          Inasmuch as Continental agrees that the issue is not constitutional mootn\n\nprudential mootness, we may assume that even after substantial or total consummatio\n\nits reorganization, some effective relief would have been and still is available fo\n\nTrustees' claim.    It is quite another matter in light of the substantial, indeed\n\nirrevocable, change in the status quo to determine that it would have been equitabl\n\nthe court to reach the merits of the Trustees' claim.    For the district court had b\n\nit an unstayed bankruptcy reorganization plan, and many courts have based their pru\n\ndecisions to decline to consider challenges to bankruptcy court orders on the groun\n\nthere has been substantial consummation of a plan of reorganization in reliance upo\n\nunstayed confirmation order.    See, e.g., Rochman, 963 F.2d at 475.\n\n          In Chateaugay I, the court noted that although the Bankruptcy Code only r\n\na stay pending appeal in limited circumstances, there is a procedure under Bankrupt\n\n8005 to seek to preserve the status quo and \"[t]he party who appeals without seekin\n\n\n                                              13\n\favail himself of that protection does so at his own risk.\"      988 F.2d at 326.   And i\n\nManges, the court observed, under the descriptive title \"Halting the Runaway Train:\n\nMotions to Stay,\" that \"in many of the cases in which bankruptcy appeals were dismi\n\nmoot, the appellants failed to seek a stay.\"    29 F.3d 1039.\n\n          Even the seeking of a stay may not be enough.    The appellants in In re UN\n\nIndustries had sought a stay, albeit unsuccessfully, at every opportunity; nonethel\n\nthe court noted, \"[a] stay not sought, and a stay sought and denied, lead equally t\n\nimplementation of the plan of reorganization.\" 20 F.3d at 770.      Accord AOV Indus.,\n\nF.2d at 1144, 1146-47.\n\n          Shortly after the confirmation of the Continental Plan, the Trustees file\n\nEmergency Motion for Conditional Stay of Order Confirming the Plan pending their ap\n\nthe district court.   The condition the Trustees sought in lieu of a stay was the\n\nestablishment of a segregated account for $117 million, the full amount of their ad\n\nprotection claim, or alternatively at least $22 million, which they claim was the a\n\ndecline in the value of the collateral.   See App. at 1721.     In response to the cour\n\ninquiry, they conceded that they were not willing to post any bond.      The district c\n\nnever required a supersedeas bond in the amount of $450,000,000, as the dissent sug\n\nIn fact, the district court tried to ascertain the amount of bond that would be\n\nreasonable, and the Trustees' general position was that they were \"merely the fiduc\n\nthe money of their bondholders\" and they suggested no lesser amount. App. at 1729.\n\n          Thus, as one of the reasons for its order denying the stay, the district\n\nnoted their unwillingness to post a bond satisfactory to the court.     App. at 1756.\n\ne.g., Central States, 841 F.2d at 95 (appellant's failure to post bond to stay\n\nconfirmation order basis for finding appeal moot).    Because the failure to post the\n\nneeded to get a stay permitted the consummation of the plan, this factor weighs hea\n\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\ffavor of the district court's declination to delve into the merits of the Trustees'\n\nappeal.\n\n           The Trustees argue that this court has held that failure to obtain a stay\n\nnot necessarily render an appeal moot.    The cases to which they refer are not appos\n\nIn one, In re Joshua Slocum Ltd., 922 F.2d 1081 (3d Cir. 1990), the issue was the n\n\none of the power of the bankruptcy court to excise a paragraph from a shopping cent\n\nlease.    There is no indication in Slocum that there had been any confirmation of a\n\nbefore or during the appeal.\n\n           In the more recent case to which the Trustees refer, Megafoods Stores, In\n\nFlagstaff Realty Assocs. (In re Flagstaff Realty Assocs.), 60 F.3d 1031 (3d Cir. 19\n\nthe appeal also presented a narrow landlord-tenant issue, i.e. the effect of confir\n\nof the landlord's plan on a tenant's right to pursue its appeal of the bankruptcy c\n\ndenial of its recoupment claim.   In holding that it was not necessary for the tenan\n\nseek a stay in order to pursue its right to appeal despite the confirmation in the\n\ninterim, we noted the line of cases placing recoupment and setoff in a special cate\n\nand stated, \"although we recognize the importance of maintaining the integrity of\n\nconfirmed plans from later attack, these unique circumstances permit the plan to be\n\nreopened and readjusted.\" Id. at 1036.    Thus, neither Flagstaff nor Slocum addresse\n\nequitable or prudential mootness at issue here.\n\n            The Trustees argue that they had no obligation to take steps to preserve\n\nstatus quo through a stay because the Plan contained \"a built-in mechanism for the\n\nconfirmation] disposition and payment of Disputed Administrative Claims.\" Appellant\n\nBrief at 10.   Assuming arguendo, as Continental does in its brief, that the Plan\n\nprovisions for post-confirmation payment of administrative claims to the extent the\n\nbeen allowed by a \"Final Order,\" App. at 656, 691, 1057, was applicable to a claim\n\ntype and magnitude of that asserted by the Trustees, the availability of such a mec\n\n\n                                              15\n\fdoes not allay all prudential and equitable concerns.   The significant fact is that\n\nTrustees' claim was not \"allowed\" by the bankruptcy court before confirmation, and\n\nsuch disallowance was an essential factor in the Investors' decision to proceed to\n\nthe transaction.\n\n           One of the concerns of the Investors that needed to be satisfied as a con\n\nof their participation was that the total amount that would have to be paid for\n\nadministrative claims could be distorted by a few large claims.   These included, in\n\nparticular, labor claims by airline pilots, large claims by Eastern Airlines, and t\n\nadequate protection claims of the Appellant Trustees.   To limit their exposure, the\n\nInvestment Agreement provided that the Investors' obligation to proceed with the\n\narrangements was subject, inter alia, to the payments and obligations for administr\n\nclaims being no higher than a specified amount.\n\n           The bankruptcy court found in its detailed Findings of Fact, Conclusions\n\nand Order Confirming the Debtors' Revised Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganizati\n\nthere was substantial, credible and uncontested evidence that the administrative cl\n\npayable at confirmation would be within the specified limit of the cap set forth in\n\nInvestment Agreement. It found that neither the pilots' claims nor the Eastern clai\n\nentitled to administrative priority, and that the Trustees' adequate protection cla\n\nno value as an administrative claim.   It based its statutorily required determinati\n\nthe Plan was feasible, see 11 U.S.C. ยง 1129(a)(11), in part on these findings.    App\n\n1548-53.\n\n           High on the list of prudential considerations taken into account by court\n\nconsidering whether to allow an appeal following a consummated reorganization is th\n\nreliance by third parties, in particular investors, on the finality of the transact\n\nSee Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039 (\"[t]he concept of 'mootness' from a prudential standpo\n\nprotects the interests of non-adverse third parties who are not before the reviewin\n\n\n                                             16\n\fbut who have acted in reliance upon the plan as implemented\"); Rochman, 963 F.3d at\n\n(similar).   It seems to be uncontested that if the Trustees' claims at issue here h\n\napproved as administrative claims, the total such claims would have greatly exceede\n\ncap specified by the Investors for that purpose.    This would have given the Investo\n\noption to withdraw; such withdrawal would have placed the entire Plan in jeopardy.\n\n          The district court specifically found, in dismissing the Trustees' appeal\n\nmoot, that the Investors had relied on the bankruptcy court's order and that there\n\nintegral nexus between the investment and the success of the Plan.       The court sta\n\n\"[t]he Investors relied on the unstayed Confirmation Order in making the $450 milli\n\ninvestment in Continental's Plan.

Although the Trustees argue that t\n\nfinding is erroneous, there is support for it in the record.\n\n          At the hearing in April 1993 before the district court on the Trustees' r\n\nfor the conditional stay of the Confirmation Order, counsel for the Trustees stated\n\nhad testimony that \"as a matter of business judgment, it would be extremely unlikel\n\nthe investors to walk away from this deal if . . . a 22-million-dollar deposit was\n\nestablished.\"   App. at 1727.   The Trustees' counsel in effect challenged the Invest\n\nassert otherwise, stating that inasmuch as the Investors' counsel were in court the\n\ncorrect any assertions that he made.    Id.   Thereafter, the Investors' attorney ros\n\nmake clear the [I]nvestors' position, which is that if the relief is granted to [th\n\nTrustees] which they seek from the Court this morning [the stay conditioned on a de\n\nof some $22 million to $117 million], then we are not prepared to close the transac\n\nApp. at 1744.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f          The representative of the Investors explained that in the airline busines\n\n\"there is a great sensitivity to cash and the capital structure of a reorganized en\n\nand that the relief that the Trustees sought \"could significantly impair the capita\n\nstructure that would exist with respect [to] this reorganized airline.\"   Id. at 174\n\nHe reviewed the negotiations that had occurred for the cap for administrative expen\n\nliability, advised that the Investors had monitored on a monthly basis Continental'\n\nperformance in that respect, explained that the Investors had insisted that the\n\nconfirmation order address the issue of the Trustees' claim \"because we want to mak\n\nif we are putting our money in, we are getting the benefit of our bargain, which is\n\nreorganized entity with a capital structure that we contemplated.\"   App. at 1746.\n\nconcluded by stating unequivocally that if a stay were entered conditioned upon the\n\nthe Trustees sought, then his client \"would not be prepared to close this transacti\n\nId.   The Trustees' counsel did not thereafter argue that the Investors' counsel's\n\nstatements were insufficiently probative, and therefore that suggestion here is les\n\npersuasive.\n\n          In response to this evidence of reliance, the Trustees now argue that whe\n\nInvestors closed the transaction they were aware that they were taking a risk that\n\nTrustees would be successful on appeal on the law or facts supporting their claim.\n\nrecord shows, however, that all parties were well aware of the extensive legal prec\n\ndismissing as moot appeals from unstayed consummated reorganizations.   See App. at\n\n(references in the Investment Agreement); App. at 1729-30, 1741 (argument before th\n\ndistrict court on the stay).   In light of the long line of cases that recognize the\n\nprudential considerations that militate against upsetting expectations that formed\n\nintegral part of a complex reorganization, we decline to hold that the Investors we\n\nunreasonable in proceeding with their investment in reliance on the confirmation or\n\nBy the time the district court ruled, it was no longer possible to restore the part\n\n\n                                             18\n\ftheir earlier positions because the investment had been made, and the option to wit\n\nbecause the administrative claims exceeded the cap was no longer available to the\n\nInvestors.   See Specialty Equip., 3 F.3d at 1049 (claim held moot when its acceptan\n\n\"would amount to imposing a different plan of reorganization on the parties\").\n\n          The Trustees have not presented us with any arguments, other than the\n\navailability of the post-confirmation mechanism for administrative claims, which wo\n\nweigh against all of the prudential considerations that dictate that this consummat\n\nreorganization must be left in place.   Following confirmation, Continental was oper\n\nas a restructured company, and had entered into countless new relationships and\n\ntransactions.   To convince a court to take the action sought by the Trustees which\n\nundermine the basis for the Investors' decision to proceed, the Trustees would have\n\nproffer a powerful reason indeed. They have not even attempted to do so.\n\n          Our dissenting colleague does not disagree with the concept, unchallenged\n\nTrustee and universally accepted elsewhere, that equitable considerations may make\n\nimprudent to upset a consummated reorganization plan.   Nor do we understand the dis\n\ntake issue with our identification of the five considerations relevant to applicati\n\nthat doctrine, by whatever name it is denominated.   Instead, the dissent merely dis\n\nwith application of that doctrine in this case, based on the dissent's view that th\n\nInvestors factored the possibility of a reversal into their investment decision, an\n\ndissent's \"serious doubt\" that the Investors banked on the 100% probability that th\n\nTrustees would recover nothing.   Record support for the dissent's view has not been\n\nand the district court, which was far closer to the parties and the events than we\n\nmade a finding that there was such reliance by these Investors.   See App. at 1874.\n\nevent, the district court did not base that finding on any \"100% probability\" facto\n\nissue the dissent has created.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f          Even more important, the district court reached its conclusion based on m\n\nthan one consideration, principally the facts that the reorganization plan was\n\nconsummated, no stay was obtained, numerous other parties have changed their positi\n\nand numerous irrevocable transactions have since been completed as a result of the\n\nconsummation of the Plan.\n\n          Without listing all of such transactions set forth by Continental in its\n\nwe note that among those are the distribution to unsecured creditors, the merger of\n\ndebtors other than Continental with and into Continental, the investment of $110 mi\n\nin cash by Air Partners and Air Canada in the reorganized Continental, the transfer\n\nforeign governments of various route authorities, and the assumption by the reorgan\n\nContinental of unexpired leases and executory contracts worth over $5.0 billion.     T\n\nthe \"key issue\" really is whether the district court abused its discretion in weigh\n\nvarious equitable factors.   While a judge on this court might reach a different equ\n\nbalance, we are not prepared to hold that the balance reached by the district court\n\nabuse of its discretion.\n\n          Under the circumstances presented here, we can see no prudential consider\n\nthat would support an attempt by an appellate court, district or court of appeals,\n\nfashion even a limited remedy for the Trustees.    That would necessarily entail impo\n\nnew debt on the reorganized company, which is a different entity than it was when t\n\ncase was before the district court.   Thus, we agree with the determination of the d\n\ncourt that the Trustees' claim was moot.   We base our holding on our conclusion tha\n\nwould be neither prudent nor equitable to grant the Trustees the relief they seek.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons set forth we will affirm the order of the district court.\n_____________________________\n\n\n                                             20\n\fIn Re: Continental Airlines\nNo. 94-7748\n\n\n\n\nALITO, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n          The majority's decision in this case is disturbing.

J.A. 17\n\nThe case is clearly not moot in the sense that the courts lack the ability to provi\n\nmeaningful relief, and it seems obvious that the Trustees could receive at least so\nrelief without undermining the plan of reorganization.   Indeed, the plan itself con\n\nmechanism for providing such relief, and Continental represented in the bankruptcy\n\nthat the Trustees would be paid under this provision if their claim was allowed. De\n\nall this, both the district court and the majority have refused to consider the Tru\n\narguments and have thus left them without a decision on the merits by any Article I\n\ncourt. In producing this result, the majority relies on considerations of \"prudence\n\n\"equity,\" but in my view such considerations weigh strongly in favor of entertainin\n\nTrustees' arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f          The majority begins its analysis by identifying five factors that have be\n\nconsidered by other courts \"in determining whether it would be equitable or prudent\n\nreach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal.\"   Maj.

And the remaining factors seem to be largely, if not entirely, subsumed wi\n\nfactors three and four.2\n\n          For these reasons, it seems to me that the key issue in this case is whet\n\ninvestors in NewCal (the \"Investors\") or others reasonably relied on the prediction\n\nthe Trustees would recover nothing on their claim.3   If they did, then it might be\n\nto upset their reliance interests.    If they did not, I see nothing unfair about\n\nentertaining that claim on the merits.\n\n          In considering the question of reliance, I will start with the Investors\n\ntheir plight looms large in the analyses of the majority and the district court.      W\n\nInvestors decided to invest $450 million in NewCal they knew or should have known t\n\nunder the reorganization plan NewCal would be required to pay the Trustees' claim i\n\nwas ultimately allowed.    Section 10.1 of the plan provided that NewCal would pay \"A\n\nAdministrative Claims.\"    Moreover, in order to persuade the bankruptcy court to rej\n\nTrustees' request that a cash reserve be established prior to confirmation to cover\n\nclaim, Continental argued that such a reserve was unnecessary because if the Truste\n\nclaim was allowed it would be \"an Allowed Administrative Claim which would be paid\n\naccordance with the terms of Section 10.1 of the Plan.\"    J.A. 1039.   In addition, w\n\n2\n  2.   As the majority seems to recognize (see Maj. Op. at 14), the first factor\n(substantial consummation) is important in large part because investors and others\nlikely to have relied on a plan once this stage is reached. In addition, I would s\nthat substantial consummation also marks the point at which the policy against dist\na reorganization plan (factor four) comes prominently into play. The same would ap\nbe true of the second factor (the absence of a stay) since, as the majority notes (\nOp. at 15), the lack of a stay \"permit[s] substantial consummation.\" Maj. Op. at 1\nAnd as for the fifth factor (\"the public policy of affording finality to bankruptcy\njudgments\"), if entertaining the Trustees' appeal would not upset reasonable relian\ninterests or undermine the reorganization, it is difficult to see why this public p\nwould be offended.\n3\n  Continental frames the central issue in similar terms, stating: \"The relevant quest\n. . . whether providing the requested relief would inequitably injure the interests\nthose whose actions in reliance upon the unstayed Confirmation Order resulted in\nsubstantial consummation.\" Appellee's Br. at 11.\n\n\n                                              23\n\fInvestors made their investment, the bankruptcy court's denial of the Trustees' cla\n\nalready on appeal to the district court.    Under these circumstances, any prudent in\n\nin deciding whether to invest in NewCal on particular terms, would have taken into\n\nthe range and likelihood of possible outcomes in the Trustees' appeal, including th\n\npossibility that the appeal would be successful in whole or in part.   No reasonable\n\ninvestor would have proceeded on the assumption that there was a 100% probability t\n\nTrustees would recover nothing.   Consequently, we would not be upsetting any reason\n\nreliance interests by holding that the Trustees' arguments should be considered on\n\nmerits.\n\n          In response to this argument, the majority writes:\n          The record shows . . . that all parties were well aware of the\n          extensive legal precedent dismissing as moot appeals from unstayed\n          consummated reorganizations. . . . In light of the long line of cases\n          that recognize the prudential considerations that militate against\n          upsetting expectations that formed an integral part of a complex\n          reorganization, we decline to hold that the Investors were\n          unreasonable in proceeding with their investment in reliance on the\n          confirmation order.\n\n\nMaj. Op. at 23.\n          If I correctly understand this passage, its reasoning is circular.   Accor\nthe majority, it was reasonable for the Investors to rely on the Trustees' losing b\n\nthe Investors had a reasonable basis for concluding that if they reasonably relied\n\nTrustees' losing the Trustees would lose.   And of course the Trustees would lose be\n\nthe Investors reasonably relied on the Trustees' losing because of the Investors'\n\nreasonable reliance on the Trustees' losing as a result of the Investors' reasonabl\n\nreliance . . . .\n\n          The plain fact is that the Investors did not act reasonably or prudently\n\nrelied on a calculation that there was a 100% probability that the Trustees' claim\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fcompletely fail.4   (Such reliance would have been no more reasonable than reliance\n\ncalculation that there was a 100% probability that fuel prices would not increase o\n\nany other contingency that might harm the company would not come to pass.) Instead,\n\nInvestors acted reasonably and prudently, they factored into their investment decis\n\nthe possibility that the Trustees would be successful in whole or in part.5   And the\n\nis true of the other parties that relied on the plan.   These parties, no less than\n\nInvestors, should have known that NewCal was obligated under section 10.1 of the pl\n\npay allowed administrative expenses and that Continental had obtained an important\n\nfrom the bankruptcy court by representing that the Trustees' claim if allowed would\n\npaid by NewCal under this provision.\n\n          In sum, entertaining the Trustees' claim on the merits would not upset an\n\nreasonable reliance interests.   Nor would the mere act of entertaining those claims\n\nimperil Continental's reorganization.   If the Trustees' claim was considered and th\n\non the merits (by no means a foregone conclusion), any threat to the reorganization\n\n\n4\n  The majority says that the \"`100% probability' factor [is] an issue the dissent ha\ncreated.\" Maj. Op. 25. However, this \"factor\" is implicit in the majority's reaso\nIf a reasonable investor would have proceeded on the basis of the calculation that\nwas, let us say, a 50% probability the Trustees would ultimately recover something\ntheir claim, then I fail to see how we would necessarily be upsetting a reasonable\nreliance interest by holding that the Trustees' claim had to be entertained on the\n5\n  Although actual but unreasonable reliance interests are not relevant here, I must\nan aside that I seriously doubt that the Investors banked on a calculation that the\na 100% probability that the Trustees would recover nothing. The majority suggests\nthe district court made a \"finding\" that the Investors did so, but I am not sure th\nmajority has correctly interpreted what the district court wrote. The district cou\nstated: \"The Investors relied on the unstayed confirmation order in making the $45\nmillion investment in Continental's Plan.\" J.A. at 1874. This may mean no more th\nthe Investors, in deciding to commit the $450 million, took into account the fact t\nplan had been confirmed and had not been stayed. Taking these facts into account (\nwould certainly have been reasonable) is quite different from relying on a 100%\nprobability that the Trustees' claim would be entirely unsuccessful. In any event,\ndistrict court meant to say the latter, neither the district court's opinion,\nContinental's brief, nor the majority's opinion cites any support in the record for\nremarkable \"finding.\"\n\n\n                                             25\n\fbe taken into account in framing the Trustees' relief.     What the district court and\n\nmajority have done -- throwing the Trustees out of court before the merits of their\n\nare even heard -- is unjustified and unjust.\n\n           I find it ironic that the majority invokes equity to support this result.\n\nnoted, Continental argued in the bankruptcy court that the Trustees' claim, if allo\n\nwould be \"an Allowed Administrative Claim which would be paid in accordance with th\n\nof Section 10.1 of the Plan.\"   J.A. 1039.    Now, Continental contends that the Trust\n\nclaim, even if valid on the merits, should not be paid under this provision.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 158(d).\n\n                                            II.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n                                             A.\n\n          The merits issues on which the parties divide present interesting and\n\nchallenging questions of first impression for this court, and some appear not to ha\n\ndecided by any appellate court.   The Trustees argue that neither the Bankruptcy\n\nCode nor any reliable precedent supports the bankruptcy court's holding that a cred\n\nmust file a motion to lift the automatic stay as a prerequisite to seeking adequate\n\nprotection.   They argue that this is a matter of law that this court can decide de\n\neven though the district court did not reach the issue. They further argue that the\n\nbankruptcy court's finding that there was no diminution in the market value of the\n\nTrustees' collateral after they filed their Lift-Stay Motion was clearly erroneous.\n\nFinally, they argue that the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law in denying t\n\nmotion for the establishment of a cash deposit.\n\n          Not surprisingly, Continental, as appellee, defends both the bankruptcy c\n\nlegal determination that the Trustees could not assert adequate protection claims f\n\nalleged market value decline during the period before they moved for relief from th\n\nautomatic stay and its factual conclusion that there had been no substantial declin\n\n\n                                             7\n\fthe value of the collateral since the Lift-Stay Motion was filed.    Finally, it argu\n\nin any event the Trustees could not recover for adequate protection because the val\n\nthe collateral did not decline below its value on the petition date, which Continen\n\ncontends is the relevant measure.\n\n          We would reach these issues only if we were satisfied that the district c\n\nerred in holding that the Trustees' appeals to it were moot, a decision as to which\n\nparties vigorously disagree.   Mootness vel non of the appeals before the district c\n\nclosely related to, if not indistinguishable from, the question whether the appeal\n\ncourt is moot, an issue which Continental alludes to in its brief.   For convenience\n\nwill refer to mootness in the district court unless we state otherwise.\n\n          Continental does not contend that the appeals to the district court or to\n\nwere moot in the constitutional sense, implicating the case or controversy requirem\n\nArticle III, ยง1.

In suc\n\ninstances, the strong public interest in the finality of bankruptcy reorganizations\n\nparticularly compelling.\n\n          The district court dismissed the appeals to it as moot based on the concl\n\nset forth in its opinion dated December 30, 1993, that substantial consummation of\n\nPlan had occurred, the Investors had already made their $450 million investment int\n\nreorganized entity, all elements of the Plan, except distributions to the unsecured\n\ncreditors, had been completed, and a reversal of the order confirming the Plan like\n\nwould put Continental back into bankruptcy.

They suggest\n\nas their object is not to disturb the reorganization, but only to get payment from\n\nreorganized Continental for their adequate protection claim measured by the market\n\ndecline of the collateral during bankruptcy, the line of cases upon which Continent\n\nrelies is inapplicable.    We cannot agree, because the rejection of the Trustees' cl\n\nthe bankruptcy court was inextricably intertwined with the implementation of the\n\nreorganization.    See AOV Indus., 792 F.2d at 1148 (to evaluate mootness, court must\n\n\"scrutinize each individual claim, testing the feasibility of granting the relief a\n\nits potential impact on the reorganization scheme as a whole\").    Thus, the Trustees\n\navoid the effect of the substantial consummation of the reorganization plan so read\n\n          Inasmuch as Continental agrees that the issue is not constitutional mootn\n\nprudential mootness, we may assume that even after substantial or total consummatio\n\nits reorganization, some effective relief would have been and still is available fo\n\nTrustees' claim.    It is quite another matter in light of the substantial, indeed\n\nirrevocable, change in the status quo to determine that it would have been equitabl\n\nthe court to reach the merits of the Trustees' claim.    For the district court had b\n\nit an unstayed bankruptcy reorganization plan, and many courts have based their pru\n\ndecisions to decline to consider challenges to bankruptcy court orders on the groun\n\nthere has been substantial consummation of a plan of reorganization in reliance upo\n\nunstayed confirmation order.    See, e.g., Rochman, 963 F.2d at 475.\n\n          In Chateaugay I, the court noted that although the Bankruptcy Code only r\n\na stay pending appeal in limited circumstances, there is a procedure under Bankrupt\n\n8005 to seek to preserve the status quo and \"[t]he party who appeals without seekin\n\n\n                                              13\n\favail himself of that protection does so at his own risk.\"      988 F.2d at 326.   And i\n\nManges, the court observed, under the descriptive title \"Halting the Runaway Train:\n\nMotions to Stay,\" that \"in many of the cases in which bankruptcy appeals were dismi\n\nmoot, the appellants failed to seek a stay.\"    </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n          Even the seeking of a stay may not be enough.    The appellants in In re UN\n\nIndustries had sought a stay, albeit unsuccessfully, at every opportunity; nonethel\n\nthe court noted, \"[a] stay not sought, and a stay sought and denied, lead equally t\n\nimplementation of the plan of reorganization.\" 20 F.3d at 770.      Accord AOV Indus.,\n\nF.2d at 1144, 1146-47.\n\n          Shortly after the confirmation of the Continental Plan, the Trustees file\n\nEmergency Motion for Conditional Stay of Order Confirming the Plan pending their ap\n\nthe district court.   The condition the Trustees sought in lieu of a stay was the\n\nestablishment of a segregated account for $117 million, the full amount of their ad\n\nprotection claim, or alternatively at least $22 million, which they claim was the a\n\ndecline in the value of the collateral.   See App. at 1721.     In response to the cour\n\ninquiry, they conceded that they were not willing to post any bond.      The district c\n\nnever required a supersedeas bond in the amount of $450,000,000, as the dissent sug\n\nIn fact, the district court tried to ascertain the amount of bond that would be\n\nreasonable, and the Trustees' general position was that they were \"merely the fiduc\n\nthe money of their bondholders\" and they suggested no lesser amount. App. at 1729.\n\n          Thus, as one of the reasons for its order denying the stay, the district\n\nnoted their unwillingness to post a bond satisfactory to the court.

The significant fact is that\n\nTrustees' claim was not \"allowed\" by the bankruptcy court before confirmation, and\n\nsuch disallowance was an essential factor in the Investors' decision to proceed to\n\nthe transaction.\n\n           One of the concerns of the Investors that needed to be satisfied as a con\n\nof their participation was that the total amount that would have to be paid for\n\nadministrative claims could be distorted by a few large claims.   These included, in\n\nparticular, labor claims by airline pilots, large claims by Eastern Airlines, and t\n\nadequate protection claims of the Appellant Trustees.   To limit their exposure, the\n\nInvestment Agreement provided that the Investors' obligation to proceed with the\n\narrangements was subject, inter alia, to the payments and obligations for administr\n\nclaims being no higher than a specified amount.\n\n           The bankruptcy court found in its detailed Findings of Fact, Conclusions\n\nand Order Confirming the Debtors' Revised Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganizati\n\nthere was substantial, credible and uncontested evidence that the administrative cl\n\npayable at confirmation would be within the specified limit of the cap set forth in\n\nInvestment Agreement.

It seems to be uncontested that if the Trustees' claims at issue here h\n\napproved as administrative claims, the total such claims would have greatly exceede\n\ncap specified by the Investors for that purpose.    This would have given the Investo\n\noption to withdraw; such withdrawal would have placed the entire Plan in jeopardy.\n\n          The district court specifically found, in dismissing the Trustees' appeal\n\nmoot, that the Investors had relied on the bankruptcy court's order and that there\n\nintegral nexus between the investment and the success of the Plan.

Although the Trustees argue that t\n\nfinding is erroneous, there is support for it in the record.\n\n          At the hearing in April 1993 before the district court on the Trustees' r\n\nfor the conditional stay of the Confirmation Order, counsel for the Trustees stated\n\nhad testimony that \"as a matter of business judgment, it would be extremely unlikel\n\nthe investors to walk away from this deal if . . . a 22-million-dollar deposit was\n\nestablished.\"   App. at 1727.

The Trustees' counsel did not thereafter argue that the Investors' counsel's\n\nstatements were insufficiently probative, and therefore that suggestion here is les\n\npersuasive.\n\n          In response to this evidence of reliance, the Trustees now argue that whe\n\nInvestors closed the transaction they were aware that they were taking a risk that\n\nTrustees would be successful on appeal on the law or facts supporting their claim.\n\nrecord shows, however, that all parties were well aware of the extensive legal prec\n\ndismissing as moot appeals from unstayed consummated reorganizations.   See App. at\n\n(references in the Investment Agreement); App. at 1729-30, 1741 (argument before th\n\ndistrict court on the stay).   In light of the long line of cases that recognize the\n\nprudential considerations that militate against upsetting expectations that formed\n\nintegral part of a complex reorganization, we decline to hold that the Investors we\n\nunreasonable in proceeding with their investment in reliance on the confirmation or\n\nBy the time the district court ruled, it was no longer possible to restore the part\n\n\n                                             18\n\ftheir earlier positions because the investment had been made, and the option to wit\n\nbecause the administrative claims exceeded the cap was no longer available to the\n\nInvestors.   See Specialty Equip., 3 F.3d at 1049 (claim held moot when its acceptan\n\n\"would amount to imposing a different plan of reorganization on the parties\").\n\n          The Trustees have not presented us with any arguments, other than the\n\navailability of the post-confirmation mechanism for administrative claims, which wo\n\nweigh against all of the prudential considerations that dictate that this consummat\n\nreorganization must be left in place.   Following confirmation, Continental was oper\n\nas a restructured company, and had entered into countless new relationships and\n\ntransactions.   To convince a court to take the action sought by the Trustees which\n\nundermine the basis for the Investors' decision to proceed, the Trustees would have\n\nproffer a powerful reason indeed. They have not even attempted to do so.\n\n          Our dissenting colleague does not disagree with the concept, unchallenged\n\nTrustee and universally accepted elsewhere, that equitable considerations may make\n\nimprudent to upset a consummated reorganization plan.   Nor do we understand the dis\n\ntake issue with our identification of the five considerations relevant to applicati\n\nthat doctrine, by whatever name it is denominated.   Instead, the dissent merely dis\n\nwith application of that doctrine in this case, based on the dissent's view that th\n\nInvestors factored the possibility of a reversal into their investment decision, an\n\ndissent's \"serious doubt\" that the Investors banked on the 100% probability that th\n\nTrustees would recover nothing.   Record support for the dissent's view has not been\n\nand the district court, which was far closer to the parties and the events than we\n\nmade a finding that there was such reliance by these Investors.   See App. at 1874.\n\nevent, the district court did not base that finding on any \"100% probability\" facto\n\nissue the dissent has created.\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f          Even more important, the district court reached its conclusion based on m\n\nthan one consideration, principally the facts that the reorganization plan was\n\nconsummated, no stay was obtained, numerous other parties have changed their positi\n\nand numerous irrevocable transactions have since been completed as a result of the\n\nconsummation of the Plan.\n\n          Without listing all of such transactions set forth by Continental in its\n\nwe note that among those are the distribution to unsecured creditors, the merger of\n\ndebtors other than Continental with and into Continental, the investment of $110 mi\n\nin cash by Air Partners and Air Canada in the reorganized Continental, the transfer\n\nforeign governments of various route authorities, and the assumption by the reorgan\n\nContinental of unexpired leases and executory contracts worth over $5.0 billion.     T\n\nthe \"key issue\" really is whether the district court abused its discretion in weigh\n\nvarious equitable factors.   While a judge on this court might reach a different equ\n\nbalance, we are not prepared to hold that the balance reached by the district court\n\nabuse of its discretion.\n\n          Under the circumstances presented here, we can see no prudential consider\n\nthat would support an attempt by an appellate court, district or court of appeals,\n\nfashion even a limited remedy for the Trustees.    That would necessarily entail impo\n\nnew debt on the reorganized company, which is a different entity than it was when t\n\ncase was before the district court.   Thus, we agree with the determination of the d\n\ncourt that the Trustees' claim was moot.   We base our holding on our conclusion tha\n\nwould be neither prudent nor equitable to grant the Trustees the relief they seek.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n          For the reasons set forth we will affirm the order of the district court.\n_____________________________\n\n\n                                             20\n\fIn Re: Continental Airlines\nNo. 94-7748\n\n\n\n\nALITO, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n          The majority's decision in this case is disturbing. Much is at stake.   Th\n\nappellants (the \"Trustees\") have raised what the majority itself characterizes as\n\n\"interesting and challenging questions of first impression for this court,\" some of\n\n\"appear not to have been decided by any appellate court.\"   Maj. Op. at 8.   The dist\n\ncourt ruled that the Trustees' arguments were likely to prevail on appeal.   J.A. 17\n\nThe case is clearly not moot in the sense that the courts lack the ability to provi\n\nmeaningful relief, and it seems obvious that the Trustees could receive at least so\nrelief without undermining the plan of reorganization.   Indeed, the plan itself con\n\nmechanism for providing such relief, and Continental represented in the bankruptcy\n\nthat the Trustees would be paid under this provision if their claim was allowed. De\n\nall this, both the district court and the majority have refused to consider the Tru\n\narguments and have thus left them without a decision on the merits by any Article I\n\ncourt. In producing this result, the majority relies on considerations of \"prudence\n\n\"equity,\" but in my view such considerations weigh strongly in favor of entertainin\n\nTrustees' arguments.\n\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f          The majority begins its analysis by identifying five factors that have be\n\nconsidered by other courts \"in determining whether it would be equitable or prudent\n\nreach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal.\"   Maj. Op. at 14.   These are: \"(1) whether\n\nreorganization plan has been substantially consummated, (2) whether a stay has been\n\nobtained, (3) whether the relief requested would affect the rights of parties not b\n\nthe court, (4) whether the relief requested would affect the success of the plan, a\n\nthe public policy of affording finality to bankruptcy judgments.\"   Id.\n\n          In this case, however, these five factors seem to boil down to basically\n\ni.e., whether entertaining the Trustees' claim on the merits would upset any reason\n\nreliance interests.   This is the essence of the third factor listed by the majority\n\n\"whether the relief requested would affect the rights of parties not before the cou\n\nThe fourth factor -- \"whether the relief requested would affect the success of the\n\n- cannot justify the majority's decision to preclude the Trustees from getting any\n\n(Whether or not the plan of reorganization would be imperilled if the Trustees were\n\nawarded the full measure of relief that they seek -- a matter of sharp dispute1 --\n\ncould plausibly argue that the Trustees cannot be given any relief without endanger\n\n\n\n\n1\n The district court wrote that \"if the Court were to reverse the order confirming t\nPlan, it would likely put Continental back into bankruptcy.\" J.A. 1873. However,\nTrustees argue:\n\n          It is difficult to conceive how a reorganization -- such as Continental's\n          that involved the restructuring of over $71 billion in debt, and resulted\n          shareholder equity of $610 million, could somehow become financially impe\n          by the allowance of the Trustees' adequate protection claim. . . . Indee\n          a single shred of evidence exists in the record to indicate -- or even su\n          - that Continental would be compelled to dismantle its Plan or to file an\n          bankruptcy if the Trustees were to prevail on their adequate protection c\n\nAppellants' Br. at 24 (emphasis in original; citations omitted).\n\n\n                                             22\n\fplan.)   And the remaining factors seem to be largely, if not entirely, subsumed wi\n\nfactors three and four.2\n\n          For these reasons, it seems to me that the key issue in this case is whet\n\ninvestors in NewCal (the \"Investors\") or others reasonably relied on the prediction\n\nthe Trustees would recover nothing on their claim.3   If they did, then it might be\n\nto upset their reliance interests.    If they did not, I see nothing unfair about\n\nentertaining that claim on the merits.\n\n          In considering the question of reliance, I will start with the Investors\n\ntheir plight looms large in the analyses of the majority and the district court.      W\n\nInvestors decided to invest $450 million in NewCal they knew or should have known t\n\nunder the reorganization plan NewCal would be required to pay the Trustees' claim i\n\nwas ultimately allowed.    Section 10.1 of the plan provided that NewCal would pay \"A\n\nAdministrative Claims.\"    Moreover, in order to persuade the bankruptcy court to rej\n\nTrustees' request that a cash reserve be established prior to confirmation to cover\n\nclaim, Continental argued that such a reserve was unnecessary because if the Truste\n\nclaim was allowed it would be \"an Allowed Administrative Claim which would be paid\n\naccordance with the terms of Section 10.1 of the Plan.\"    J.A. 1039.   In addition, w\n\n2\n  2.   As the majority seems to recognize (see Maj. Op. at 14), the first factor\n(substantial consummation) is important in large part because investors and others\nlikely to have relied on a plan once this stage is reached. In addition, I would s\nthat substantial consummation also marks the point at which the policy against dist\na reorganization plan (factor four) comes prominently into play. The same would ap\nbe true of the second factor (the absence of a stay) since, as the majority notes (\nOp. at 15), the lack of a stay \"permit[s] substantial consummation.\" Maj. Op. at 1\nAnd as for the fifth factor (\"the public policy of affording finality to bankruptcy\njudgments\"), if entertaining the Trustees' appeal would not upset reasonable relian\ninterests or undermine the reorganization, it is difficult to see why this public p\nwould be offended.\n3\n  Continental frames the central issue in similar terms, stating: \"The relevant quest\n. . . whether providing the requested relief would inequitably injure the interests\nthose whose actions in reliance upon the unstayed Confirmation Order resulted in\nsubstantial consummation.\" Appellee's Br. at 11.\n\n\n                                              23\n\fInvestors made their investment, the bankruptcy court's denial of the Trustees' cla\n\nalready on appeal to the district court.    Under these circumstances, any prudent in\n\nin deciding whether to invest in NewCal on particular terms, would have taken into\n\nthe range and likelihood of possible outcomes in the Trustees' appeal, including th\n\npossibility that the appeal would be successful in whole or in part.   No reasonable\n\ninvestor would have proceeded on the assumption that there was a 100% probability t\n\nTrustees would recover nothing.   Consequently, we would not be upsetting any reason\n\nreliance interests by holding that the Trustees' arguments should be considered on\n\nmerits.\n\n          In response to this argument, the majority writes:\n          The record shows . . . that all parties were well aware of the\n          extensive legal precedent dismissing as moot appeals from unstayed\n          consummated reorganizations. . . . In light of the long line of cases\n          that recognize the prudential considerations that militate against\n          upsetting expectations that formed an integral part of a complex\n          reorganization, we decline to hold that the Investors were\n          unreasonable in proceeding with their investment in reliance on the\n          confirmation order.\n\n\nMaj.

Nor would the mere act of entertaining those claims\n\nimperil Continental's reorganization.

This may mean no more th\nthe Investors, in deciding to commit the $450 million, took into account the fact t\nplan had been confirmed and had not been stayed. Taking these facts into account (\nwould certainly have been reasonable) is quite different from relying on a 100%\nprobability that the Trustees' claim would be entirely unsuccessful. In any event,\ndistrict court meant to say the latter, neither the district court's opinion,\nContinental's brief, nor the majority's opinion cites any support in the record for\nremarkable \"finding.\"\n\n\n                                             25\n\fbe taken into account in framing the Trustees' relief.
