Because\n\ncertain CPF products produced by TPC failed the COP test as\n\napplied by Commerce, Commerce used constructed value (\"CV\") as\n\n\n\n     1\n          Defendant-intervenors Maui Pineapple Co., Ltd., elected\nnot to file a response brief and did not otherwise participate in\nthe substantive aspects of this case.\n     2\n          Third country sales are sales of like merchandise in\nother than the United States or the exporting country. See 19\nU.S.C. § 1677b(a)(1)(B)(ii) (1994).\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 6\n\n\nthe basis of normal value (\"NV\")3 where (1) there were no\n\ncontemporaneous sales of a comparable product or (2) all\n\ncontemporaneous sales of a comparable product failed the COP\n\ntest.    Gov't Br. at 14.   For both COP and CV, Commerce determined\n\nthe cost of production of CPF using a single, weighted-average\n\ncost for the entire period of review.    Final Results, 63 Fed.\n\nReg. at 7,399-7,400.\n\n     Given generally rising costs,4 TPC computed a separate cost\n\n\n     3\n          If sufficient quantities of goods are sold in the\ncountry of production above the cost of production, normal value\nwill be based on home country sales prices. If home country\nsales are not usable, Commerce may use third country sales or CV,\nwhich is based on COP, as normal value. See 19 U.S.C.\n§ 1677b(a).\n     4\n          By plaintiff’s calculations, fresh pineapple costs per\ncarton of CPF, computed using the Department’s net realizable\nvalue (“NRV”) method, rose by [ ]% from 1994 to 1995 and by [ ]%\nfrom 1994 to 1996. See Memo from Commerce (July 31, 1997), at\nSch. 1, C.R. Doc. 86, Pl.'s App., Tab 9, at 2 ([ ] baht per\nstandard carton in 1995 and [ ] in 1996); TPC Case Brief (Sept.\n8, 1997), at Attachment 1, C.R. Doc. 87, Pl.'s App., Tab 10, at 9\n([ ] baht per standard carton in 1994).\n     Fresh pineapple costs account for about [ ]% of the finished\nproduct cost. Plaintiff arrives at this calculation by dividing\nthe Total Net Pineapple Cost to CPF of [ ] by total standard\ncases, [ ], to yield fruit costs of [ ] baht per carton and\ncomparing this with total cost of manufacturing (\"TOTCOM\") for\n1995 products ranging from [ ] baht per carton to [ ] baht per\ncarton. Memo from Commerce, at Sch.s 1 and 5(a), Pl.'s App., Tab\n9, at 2-3. In addition, interest expenses (“INTEX”), calculated\naccording to the methodology used by the Department in its\nPreliminary and Final Results, amounted to [ ]% of cost of\nmanufacturing (\"COM\") in 1995, but were [ ] in 1994. TPC Case\nBrief, at 7, Pl.'s App., Tab 10, at 2.\n     Therefore, plaintiffs calculate that finished product costs\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 7\n\n\nfor each fiscal period covered by its sales responses -- 1994,\n\n1995, and 1996 -- and submitted them in its cost responses with a\n\nrequest that the Department use the separate fiscal period costs\n\nfor its determinations of COP and CV.    TPC Section D\n\nQuestionnaire Response (Feb. 18, 1997), at 27, C.R. Doc. 31,\n\nPl.'s App., Tab 11, at 2.    Notwithstanding TPC’s request, the\n\nDepartment calculated a single “average” COP and a single\n\n“average” CV based on costs of production computed over the\n\nperiod January 1, 1995, to June 30, 1996.    Final Results, 63 Fed.\n\nReg. at 7,399-7,400.    Plaintiffs allege that the calculation of a\n\nsingle, weighted-average cost over this period, and the use of\n\nthat cost for comparison to sales prices early in the period,\n\nresulted in significant distortions in the Department’s price-\n\ncost comparisons, including distortions in its determination of\n\nwhich sales should be disregarded as below cost and in the\n\nDepartment’s determination of CV.   Id. at 7,399.   Plaintiffs\n\nallege in particular that distortion occurred because the\n\nDepartment did not match up 1995 sales with the low 1994 costs\n\n\n\n\nrose by [ ]% from 1994 to 1995 and by [ ]% from 1994 to the first\nhalf of 1996. Pl.'s Br. at 8 (computed by multiplying the\nincrease in fresh fruit cost by [ ] to derive the increase in COM\nand adding [ ]% for increased interest expenses).\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                           PAGE 8\n\n\nrelated thereto.5   Id.\n\n     Commerce contends that costs did not rise in a continuous\n\nmanner over that entire POR and that a period-wide weighted-\n\naverage was approved in Fujitsu General Ltd. v. United States, 88\n\nF.3d 1034, 1038-39 (Fed. Cir. 1996).\n\n     B.   Discussion\n\n     It is apparent to the court that Commerce has read too much\n\ninto Fujitsu, which is readily distinguishable.   First, Fujitsu\n\napproved costs constructed on an annual basis.    Id. at 1039\n\n(\"decision to sustain Commerce's use of annual weighted-average\n\nCOP in calculating FMV . . . correct.\") (emphasis added).   This\n\nis basically all plaintiffs seek here.   They want costs for a\n\n\n\n\n     5\n          Because there is a 30-40 day transit time from Thailand\nto the United States, TPC Case Brief, at 40, Pl.'s App., Tab 10,\nat 8) and merchandise is typically held in inventory in the\nUnited States for [ ] months prior to sale to the first\nunaffiliated customer, most of the merchandise in CEP comparison\nsales made by TPC’s affiliate MFI in the first few months of the\nPOR appear to have been manufactured in 1994. See id. at 9,\nPl.'s App., Tab 10, at 4; TPC Questionnaire Response (Nov. 12,\n1996), at Ex. 56, C.R. Doc. 5, Pl.'s App., Tab 12, at 4 (showing\nnumber of days of approximately [ ] months); TPC Verification Ex.\nNo. LA-18, at 1, C.R. Doc. LA-18, Pl.'s App., Tab 14, at 1\n(showing number of days of approximately [ ] months). TPC\nbrought this fact to the Department’s attention in its initial\nresponses, reported the year of manufacture in its response, and\nsuggested that the Department calculate a separate fiscal period\nCOP and CV for 1994 production. Final Results, 63 Fed. Reg. at\n7,399.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 9\n\n\nfiscal year matched to sales for a fiscal year.6    In Fujitsu,\n\nrespondents sought monthly or quarterly averaging.    Id. at 1036.\n\n     Second, almost all of the factors which the appellate court\n\nfound were missing in Fujitsu are present here.     Fujitsu involved\n\nmulti-input television receivers, id., not a one primary-input\n\nproduct, such as canned pineapple from raw pineapple.     In such a\n\ncase, Commerce must be particularly sensitive to changes in the\n\nprice of the raw commodity.     See e.g. Brass Sheet and Strip From\n\nthe Netherlands, 53 Fed. Reg. 23,431, 23,432-33 (Dep’t Commerce\n\n1988) (final LTFV determ.) (POR split to account for metal price\n\nrise).7    Next, the Fujitsu court noted no significant cost rise\n\nfrom the beginning to the end of the POR.     Fujitsu, 88 F.3d at\n\n1039.     Here, a cost rise of almost 50% occurred over eighteen\n\nmonths, notwithstanding the fact that there was a tremendous cost\n\nrise mid-review which moderated somewhat by June 1996.     See Pl.'s\n\nBr. at Tab C (reflecting monthly fresh pineapple costs from\n\n\n     6\n          Because the POR does not match up with TPC’s fiscal\nyear, this might necessitate a 6-month averaging period, but this\ndoes not seem greatly burdensome.\n     7\n          Defendant is incorrect that this was necessitated by\nthe difference in merchandise provision because similar, not\nidentical, merchandise was used for comparison. The Brass Sheet\nrespondents requested a circumstances of sales adjustment to\naccount for a 70% metals price rise. This was denied, and\nseparate foreign market values were computed for four-month\nperiods. Comparison U.S. sales were matched to the periods. See\nBrass Sheet 54 Fed. Reg. at 23,432-433.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                       PAGE 10\n\n\nJanuary 1995 to June 1996).\n\n     In the past, the Department has adjusted for changes in\n\ncosts over the POR or matched costs to POR sales more\n\nspecifically than it did here.   The court notes a few\n\nparticularly telling examples.   In Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon\n\nSteel Flat Products from Germany, for example, the Department\n\nrelied upon separate fiscal year costs and allocated expense data\n\nfor sales observations according to the year in which the sales\n\ntook place.   60 Fed. Reg. 65,264, 65,270 (Dep’t Commerce 1995)\n\n(final results of antidumping duty admin. rev.).8\n\n     Commerce admits that there is a basic principle that\n\nCommerce will utilize shorter cost reporting periods if markets\n\nexperience significant and consistent price declines.    See, e.g.,\n\nStatic Random Access Memory Semiconductors from Taiwan, 63 Fed.\n\nReg. 8,909, 8,920 (Dep’t Commerce 1998)(final LTFV determ.).\n\nCommerce has not explained why significant price rises are not\n\nworthy of such an adjustment.9\n\n\n     8\n          Defendant is incorrect that this was done only for the\ngeneral expenses calculation. It is apparent from the discussion\nthat separate fiscal year costs and expenses were used for all\nelements of constructed value because the respondent reported\nthem that way. See Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat\nProducts from Germany, 60 Fed. Reg. at 65,270.\n     9\n          Moreover, in the preliminary determination in Static\nRandom Access, the Department stated that it would generally\n\"compare sales and conduct the sales below cost test using annual\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 11\n\n\n      Finally, the Department cannot explain away the following\n\ncases.   In Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber\n\nfrom Taiwan, the Department did not use annual average unit costs\n\nwhere there was a significant variation between what was produced\n\nduring the POR and what was sold during the POR.   55 Fed. Reg.\n\n34,585, 34,596 (Dep’t Commerce 1990) (final LTFV determ.)\n\n[hereinafter “Sweaters”].   Instead the Department used the costs\n\nof the individual production runs (whether or not falling within\n\nthe POR) in which the subject merchandise was actually produced.\n\nId.   In Fresh and Chilled Atlantic Salmon from Norway, the\n\nDepartment found that a single average cost of cultivation (COC)\n\nshould not be calculated for the POR, stating:\n\n      [B]ecause no 1990-generation salmon were harvested\n      until 1991, averaging the COC for 1990-generation\n      salmon with the 1989-generation salmon could lead to\n      distortions in determining whether 1990-third country\n      sales were made at prices below cost. Moreover, given\n      the fluctuations of farmers' costs during the POR, the\n      ease with which different generations' COC can be\n      segregated, and the fact that we have calculated\n      separate 1990 and 1991 processing costs for respondent\n      Skaarfish, we believe it is reasonable to use separate\n\n\naverages. However, where prices have moved significantly over\nthe course of the POI, it has been the Department's practice to\nuse shorter time periods.\" Static Random Access Memory\nSemiconductors from Taiwan, 62 Fed. Reg. 51,442, 51,444 (Dep't\nCommere 1997) (prelim. determination of sales at LTFV) (emphasis\nadded). This statement further shows there is no reason to limit\nthe use of shorter cost reporting periods to instances when the\nmarket experiences price declines and not when it experiences\nprice increases.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                       PAGE 12\n\n\n     1990 and 1991 COCs.\n\n58 Fed. Reg. 37,912, 37,913 (Dep’t Commerce 1993) (final results\n\nof antidumping duty admin. review) (emphasis added).\n\n     It is insufficient to cast away previous decisions on the\n\nbasis that the extent of the distortion was not noted.   This\n\ncannot be a way to insulate inconsistent decisions from review.\n\nWhile it is certainly true that the need to use monthly averages\n\ngenerally may be restricted to cases of hyper inflation, see\n\nAsociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. United States,\n\n6 F. Supp.2d 865, 873-74 n.7 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1998), even\n\nCommerce recognizes that there is a middle range choice of six\n\nmonths to one year averaging.   There is also the possibility of\n\nmatching costs more closely with sales, as various administrative\n\ndeterminations indicate.\n\n     Given the distortions in calculating COP and CV caused by\n\ninattention to the price rise for a single primary input product,\n\nand the lag between goods produced (in a one-day canning process)\n\nbut not sold until months later, Commerce must revisit this\n\nissue.\n\n     Commerce must reanalyze the data to determine whether TPC\n\nhas provided sufficient data to match costs to appropriate fiscal\n\nyear sales.   If it has, in the absence of any proper antidumping\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 13\n\n\npolicy reason10 for not doing this seemingly minimally burdensome\n\nand substantially less distortive comparison, Commerce must\n\nproceed as it has in the past and match fiscal year costs with\n\nsales.\n\nII.   Use of Date of Contract for Date of Third Country Sale\n\n      A.    Facts\n\n      In its antidumping analysis, Commerce identifies a \"date of\n\nsale\" for merchandise sold to the United States, the exporting\n\ncountry, and third countries.    In the Final Results, Commerce\n\nrecognized the existence of two dates associated with TPC's\n\nexport price (\"EP\") and third-country sales:    the earlier date of\n\ncontract and the later date of invoice.    See 63 Fed. Reg. at\n\n7,394.     Commerce examined these dates and found that all but five\n\nof the third country sales11 had identical terms in both the\n\ncontracts and the invoices.    Id.   Thus, Commerce determined that\n\nthe date of contract was the proper date of sale because the\n\ncontract, not the invoice, established the material terms of\n\n      10\n          Commerce's answer that respondents would only provide\npre-POR cost data when it suited them does not appear to be a\nsufficient reason. Commerce can ask for relevant cost data if\ncosts are either declining or rising significantly and it has not\nbeen stopped by such a concern in the past. See, e.g., Sweaters,\n55 Fed. Reg. at 34,596.\n      11\n          Five of [ ] third country sales had contract changes.\nGov't's Br. at 27. One of several hundred EP sales had changes.\nFinal Results, 63 Fed. Reg. at 7,394.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                                PAGE 14\n\n\nsale.    Id.\n\n        B.     Discussion\n\n        The first question to ask is what principle should guide\n\nCommerce in choosing the date of sale.          It appears undisputed\n\nthat in the past, in general, Commerce has looked to the date by\n\nwhich the essential terms of sale are fixed in order to determine\n\ndate of sale.      See Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United\n\nStates, No. 97-08-01328, 1998 WL 661461, at *2 (Ct. Int'l Trade\n\n1998) (citing cases).        This seems reasonable if one is trying to\n\ncompare sales in two markets or costs and sales.\n\n        There is no new statutory guidance on this point except for\n\nthe general statement that NV shall be the price \"at a time\n\nreasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to\n\ndetermine the export price or constructed export price.\"          19\n\nU.S.C. § 1677b(a)(1)(A).          There was no regulation on point\n\napplicable to the investigation at issue.\n\n        On March 29, 1996, Commerce stated in an internal memorandum\n\nthat it had published proposed regulations which provide that the\n\nagency would normally establish the date of invoice as the date\n\nof sale.       Pl.'s Br. at Tab D.     Commerce further stated that it\n\nwas implementing this change immediately in all reviews initiated\n\nafter April 1, 1996.        Id.    The administrative review at issue\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 15\n\n\nhere was initiated on August 15, 1996.   Initiation of Antidumping\n\nDuty and Countervailing Duty Admin. Reviews, 61 Fed. Reg. at\n\n42,417.   The proposed regulations referenced by Commerce in its\n\nMarch 29, 1996, memorandum were ultimately issued as final\n\nregulations on May 19, 1997.   See Antidumping Duties;\n\nCountervailing Duties, 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,296 (Dep't Comm.\n\n1997) (\"Final Regulations\").   The Final Regulations, however,\n\nonly apply to reviews requested on or after July 1, 1997.     See 19\n\nC.F.R. § 351.701 (1998).   With regard to reviews conducted\n\npursuant to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (“URAA”), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994), but not formally subject to\n\nthe Final Regulations, Commerce stated, \"[P]art 351 will serve as\n\na restatement of the Department's interpretation of the\n\nrequirements of the Act as amended by the URAA.\"     Id.   In this\n\ncase, Commerce did not refer to the regulations as controlling,\n\nbut, rather, discussed the regulations as reflecting Commerce's\n\ncurrent practice with respect to date of sale.   Final Results, 63\n\nFed. Reg. at 7,394 n.2.\n\n     Notwithstanding its new policy preference to utilize the\n\ndate of invoice as the default date of sale, Commerce determined\n\nthat the date of contract for TPC's EP and third-country sales\n\nshould determine the date of sale.   Id. at 7,394.    In the Final\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 16\n\n\nResults, Commerce stated that its new preference for the date of\n\ninvoice would apply \"’absent satisfactory evidence that the terms\n\nof sale were finally established on a different date.’\"    Id.\n\n(quoting the Final Regulations, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349).     With\n\nregard to TPC, Commerce stated that it found sufficient evidence\n\nthat the terms of sale were established on a different date.      As\n\nnoted by Commerce, \"[t]he evidence on the record indicates that\n\nthere were changes to the contracted terms of TPC's POR sales for\n\nonly one out of several hundred EP sales, and five out of several\n\nhundred third country sales.\"   Id.   For this reason, Commerce\n\ndetermined that the date of contract should act as the date of\n\nsale because all material terms of sale were established at the\n\ntime of contracting.    Id.\n\n     Accepting this as a statement of policy that applied to this\n\nproceeding, it appears that the number of changes noted may not\n\nbe particularly probative of whether or not this is an industry\n\nin which renegotiation is common, or whether the terms of the\n\nsales were firmly set on the contract date.   Thus, why this was\n\naccepted as evidence warranting departure from the general\n\ninvoice date policy is not clear.\n\n     How the new policy is being applied remains something of a\n\nmystery.   Plaintiffs offer three examples of administrative\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 17\n\n\ndecisions that at least cause some concern that Commerce acted\n\ninconsistently in this case.

Int'l Trade 1998) (date of sale\n\nestablished upon invoice and shipment to allocate indirect\n\nselling expenses to POR U.S. sales; substantial gap between sale\n\nand shipment).\n\n     Neither in the Final Results, nor in its arguments to the\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                       PAGE 18\n\n\ncourt, has Commerce offered evidence that long term contracts or\n\nlong lag time between contract and shipment or invoice was a\n\nconcern in this case.   If there is another reason for rejecting\n\ninvoice date which Commerce did not have reason to state in the\n\ncases cited, it should state that reason.   Commerce must\n\nreconsider this issue and square its reasoning with its other\n\ncontemporaneous determinations.\n\nIII. Calculation of CEP Profit\n\n     A.    Facts\n\n     Under 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(c) and (d) (1994), CEP is adjusted\n\nfor various items which are expected to be found in the sales\n\nprice.12   One of the reductions to price for purposes of arriving\n\nat CEP is profit.   19 U.S.C. § 1677a(d)(3).\n\n     Profit is calculated according to 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)\n\n(1994), which reads:\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        CEP is a constructed United States price which is\ncompared to NV to determine if the merchandise at issue is being\nsold at less than fair value in the United States. CEP is\nintended to be an approximation of ex factory price, and it is\nused in place of export price when affiliated U.S. sellers,\nrather than the exporters, make the U.S. sales.

Final Results, 63 Fed. Reg. at\n\n7,395.   The statute dictates a different approach.    The statute\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 21\n\n\ncalls for multiplication of total profit by the ratio of total\n\nUnited States expenses to total expenses.   See 19 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1677a(f)(1)-(2)(A).   Theoretically, the two computations\n\nshould yield the same result:   A * B/C = A/C * B.   The Department\n\napparently adopted its method because total profit is generally\n\nnot computed on a per-unit basis, but is calculated in gross.\n\nTherefore, the Department divides the total profit in gross by\n\nthe total expenses in gross and multiplies by unit U.S. selling\n\nexpense for an individual sale to obtain a unit profit.\n\n     The statute’s drafters intended that profit would be\n\nallocated to U.S. sales in the same ratio as United States\n\nselling expenses are to total expenses (i.e., that the portion of\n\ntotal profit on a sale attributable to activities conducted in\n\nthe United States is equal to the ratio of the cost of those\n\nactivities to the cost of all activities generating the sales\n\nrevenue).   As explained in the Statement of Administrative Action\n\n(“SAA”),13 the profit to be deducted from the CEP is the profit\n\n“allocable to the selling, distribution, and further\n\n\n     13\n          The Statement of Administrative Action represents \"an\nauthoritative expression by the Administration concerning its\nviews regarding the interpretation and application of the Uruguay\nRound Agreements . . .

(1994), at 823, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3773, 4163.\n\n“The profit to be deducted from the starting price in the U.S.\n\nmarket is that proportion of total profit equal to the proportion\n\nwhich U.S. manufacturing and selling expenses constitute of total\n\nmanufacturing and selling expense.”    SAA, at 824.\n\n     The Department does include U.S. imputed expenses in the\n\nnumerator of the applicable percentage or ratio but not in the\n\ndenominator.   See Final Results, 63 Fed. Reg. at 7,394.    The\n\nDepartment also excludes imputed expenses from the total actual\n\nprofit figure required by 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(D), which\n\nperforce represents total expenses deducted from total revenue.\n\nIt then uses the total expense figure for purposes of the\n\nstatutory ratio.    Commerce is not following the statutory formula\n\nprecisely.   It is focusing on creating symmetry in the ratio it\n\nconstructs, i.e., total profit to total expenses, as opposed to\n\nthe ratio established by the statute, total U.S. expenses to\n\ntotal expenses.    The question before the court, therefore, is\n\nwhether this is permissible.\n\n     Both parties’ briefs failed to cite the court’s decision\n\nwhich is most on point, U.S. Steel Group v. United States, 15 F.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                            PAGE 23\n\n\nSupp.2d 892, 896-98 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1998).14\n\n     B.   Discussion\n\n     In U.S. Steel, the court ruled that, under 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f), the statutory ratio applied to “actual profit” for\n\npurposes of calculating CEP profit must be calculated on a\n\nproportional basis.     15 F. Supp.2d at 896-98.   The court left\n\nundecided whether the “actual” profit calculation under 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(D) must include categories of expenses present in\n\nthe ratio.   See id. at 898 n.6.    The court indicated that\n\ndefendant had presented no argument that this was so.      Id.\n\n     In this action, defendant has attempted an explanation of\n\nwhy actual profit should not contain “imputed expenses” based on\n\nthe use of the word “actual” in 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(D), but\n\nnot elsewhere in the provision.     This is facially a plausible\n\nreason for the omission.     Commerce’s argument misses the mark,\n\nhowever, where it indicates that the statute and the SAA require\n\nthat total expenses in the statutory ratio applied to actual\n\nprofit must be exclusive of imputed expenses just because some\n\nform of total expenses is also used in the actual profit\n\n\n     14\n        This is a particularly egregious error on the part of\nthe Government, as the case is adverse to its position. Upon\ndiscovering the case during preparations for oral argument,\ncounsel should have advised opposing counsel and the court.\nFailure to do so impeded oral argument.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                           PAGE 24\n\n\ncalculation.\n\n     First, in the total actual profit provision, 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(D), the term “total expenses” is used simply to\n\nindicate the pool of sales from which to calculate actual profit.\n\nSecond, the SAA makes clear that the pool of sales involved is\n\nthe same for both total expenses in the ratio and total actual\n\nexpenses in the total actual profit calculation.    SAA, at 824-25.\n\nThird, the three alternatives for selection of a sales pool for\n\ncalculation of expenses found at 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(C) do\n\nnot relate directly to the selection of the categories of\n\nexpenses to be used in the ratio.    As with subsection\n\n1677a(f)(2)(D), it is the choice of the sales pool which is\n\nspecified, not categories of expenses.\n\n     Commerce has some flexibility in determining total U.S.\n\nexpenses under 19 U.S.C. §§ 1677a(d)(1)-(2), the figure which is\n\nused in the ratio calculation, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(B).   But if Commerce decides to include a category\n\nof expenses in calculating total U.S. expenses in the numerator,\n\nit must also include such expenses in the denominator of the\n\nratio, unless they are already represented in total expenses in\n\nsome other fashion.     See U.S. Steel, 15 F. Supp.2d at 898.    The\n\nstatutorily defined denominator represents a figure containing\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 25\n\n\nboth total U.S. expenses and the expenses attributable to the\n\nforeign like product sold in the home market.    See 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(C)(i).    Commerce cannot arbitrarily remove part of\n\nthe total U.S. expenses from the statutory ratio.\n\n     The court concludes that there is some ambiguity in the use\n\nof the word “actual” in § 1677a(f)(2)(D).    It may not be an\n\nunreasonable interpretation to conclude that imputed expenses\n\nshould be excluded in the actual profit calculation, if that\n\nconstruction can be squared with the necessity of a properly\n\ncalculated statutory ratio.   It is a proper ratio that ensures\n\nproper allocation of profit to U.S. sales.    If the profit\n\nallocable to CEP is somewhat lower because U.S. expenses are made\n\nhigher by the addition of imputed expenses, this would not seem\n\nto be antithetical to the statute.   There is also nothing that\n\ncategorically prevents the inclusion of imputed expenses.\n\nRather, imputed expenses should be omitted from actual profit if\n\nthey duplicate expenses already accounted for.    Their inclusion\n\nis not per se incompatible with the use of the word “actual.”\n\nThe question is whether the imputed expenses represent some real,\n\npreviously unaccounted for, expense.\n\n     Commerce may not ignore the statutory language just because,\n\nfor administrative reasons, it has chosen a different starting\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 26\n\n\npoint for its profit calculation.   Of course, it may continue to\n\nuse a different form of calculation if the result comports with\n\nthe statute.   What Commerce must do in this case is to start with\n\nthe statutory scheme.   If its method of calculating U.S. expenses\n\nis not compatible with the new CEP statute, it must amend that\n\napproach.   It cannot ignore that “total expenses” in the\n\ndenominator includes both U.S. expenses and expenses allocable to\n\nthe foreign sold product.   See 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(C).     Of\n\ncourse, if the imputed expenses are simply a part of an expense\n\nwhich was allocated to U.S. sales, and that portion is fully\n\nretained as to the foreign sales as a part of “total expenses,”\n\nit is perforce included in the denominator of the ratio.    If this\n\nis so, Commerce needs to support this with citations to the\n\nrecord.15   Commerce has not established that the expenses at\n\nissue are already in the denominator and thus, has not\n\ndistinguished U.S. Steel.   This issue is remanded for calculation\n\nin accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n        Commerce provides no record appendix with its brief, nor\ndid it cite to portions of the appendix provided by plaintiff.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 27\n\n\nIV.   Use of a Single Assessment Rate\n\n      A.   Facts\n\n      If Commerce makes a final affirmative dumping determination\n\nand the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") makes a final\n\naffirmative injury determination, the statute requires that\n\nCommerce publish an antidumping order which directs Customs to\n\n\"assess an antidumping duty equal to the amount by which the\n\nnormal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the\n\nconstructed export price) of the merchandise\" and to collect cash\n\ndeposits for estimated antidumping duties pending liquidation of\n\nentries.   See 19 U.S.C. § 1673e(a)(1),(3) (1994).   If an\n\nadministrative review is subsequently requested, the statute\n\nprovides that Commerce will \"review, and determine (in accordance\n\nwith paragraph (2)), the amount of any antidumping duty.\"     19\n\nU.S.C. § 1675(a)(1)(B) (1994).   \"[P]aragraph (2)\" provides that\n\nCommerce shall determine \"the normal value and export price (or\n\nconstructed export price) of each entry of the subject\n\nmerchandise\" and \"the dumping margin for each such entry.\"     19\n\nU.S.C. § 1675(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n      The statute also contains a provision entitled \"Deposit of\n\nestimated antidumping duty under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this\n\ntitle,\" which provides as follows:\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 28\n\n\n          If the amount of a cash deposit, or the amount of\n     any bond or other security, required as security for an\n     estimated antidumping duty under section 1673b(d)(1)(B)\n     of this title is different from the amount of the\n     antidumping duty determined under an antidumping duty\n     order published under section 1673e of this title, then\n     the difference for entries of merchandise entered, or\n     withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before notice\n     of the affirmative determination of the Commission\n     [ITC] under section 1673d(b) of this title is published\n     shall be —\n\n               (1) disregarded, to the extent that the\n          cash deposit, bond, or other security is\n          lower than the duty under the order, or\n\n               (2) refunded or released, to the extent that\n          the cash deposit, bond, or other security is\n          higher than the duty under the order.\n\n19 U.S.C.A. § 1673f(a) (West Supp. 1999) (emphasis added).\n\n     Plaintiff argues that the statutes, read together, require\n\nCommerce to compute two assessment rates, one for the “cap\n\nperiod” (the period from Commerce's preliminary determination\n\nthrough the publication of the ITC's affirmative final\n\ndetermination) and one for the period after publication of the\n\nITC’s affirmative injury determination.\n\n     B.   Discussion\n\n     The court simply does not agree with plaintiffs’ argument.\n\n19 U.S.C.A. § 1673f(a) is a limitation on collection.    It does\n\nnot depend on the basic direction for deriving margins set forth\n\nin 19 U.S.C. § 1675(a)(2)(A).\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                          PAGE 29\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff is disturbed because high margins\n\nrelating to sales of merchandise entered during the cap period\n\nare part of the final average margin.   It categorizes this as\n\nimporting cap period duties to post-cap entries.     Putting aside\n\nthe usual problem, which may or may not exist in this case, of\n\nmatching sales and entries, Congress did not provide that dumping\n\nmargins during the cap period in excess of the anticipated amount\n\nof dumping (i.e., amounts in excess of the preliminary finding of\n\ndumping) should be disregarded in their entirety.    Rather,\n\nCongress provided that Commerce should disregard amounts in\n\nexcess of the preliminary finding of dumping \"for entries of\n\nmerchandise\" made during the cap period.   See 19 U.S.C.A. §\n\n1673f(a).   Congress has also provided that the agency shall\n\ndetermine the dumping margin for \"each such entry\" during the\n\nperiod of review.   19 U.S.C. § 1675(a)(2)(A)(ii).    The Final\n\nResults have complied with both of these provisions by\n\ndetermining dumping margins for each entry during the period of\n\nreview but capping the assessed duties during the cap period at\n\nthe amount of estimated antidumping duties.\n\n     Previously, this Court has held that Commerce's decision to\n\ndetermine the dumping margin by use of all sales during the\n\nperiod (even sales which occur during the cap period) \"will not\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 30\n\n\nnecessarily result in the violation of the statutory duty cap\n\napplicable to entries made between the preliminary less than fair\n\nvalue determination and the publication of the ITC's injury\n\ndetermination.\"   Ad Hoc Comm. of S. California Producers Of Gray\n\nPortland Cement v. United States, 19 C.I.T. 1398, 1407-08, 914 F.\n\nSupp. 535, 545 (1995).    In Ad Hoc, the plaintiff argued that the\n\nagency's decision to utilize all sales during the review period\n\nto determine the dumping margin violated 19 U.S.C. § 1673f(a).\n\nId. at 1405, 914 F. Supp. at 543.    The Court, however, saw no\n\nviolation because the agency indicated \"that it will instruct\n\nCustoms to liquidate the relevant entries at a rate no higher\n\nthan the cap, in accordance with 19 U.S.C. § 1673f(a) (1988).\"16\n\nId. at 1408, 914 F. Supp. at 545.\n\n     Commerce explained in the Final Results that the adoption of\n\nseparate assessment rates \"would raise concerns about possible\n\nmanipulation of data to avoid AD duties and unrestrained dumping\n\nof certain merchandise subject to an order.\"     Final Results, 63\n\nFed. Reg. at 7,394.     Furthermore, the cash deposits on entries\n\nduring the cap and post-cap periods are simply estimates of\n\n\n     16\n          The only change made to 19 U.S.C. § 1673f(a), by\namendment in 1996, was the replacement of the words \"cash\ndeposit\" for \"cash deposit, bond, or other security.\" Compare 19\nU.S.C. § 1673f(a) (1988) with 19 U.S.C.A. § 1673f(a) (West Supp.\n1999).\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 31\n\n\ndumping liability.      The actual assessment of antidumping duties\n\nis calculated in an administrative review under 19 U.S.C. §\n\n1675(a) after Commerce reviews actual sales data for the period\n\nin question.   Under 19 U.S.C. § 1675(a), there is no prohibition\n\nagainst reviewing actual sales data on entries made during the\n\ncap period.\n\n     As held in Ad Hoc, 19 CIT at 1408, 914 F. Supp. at 545,\n\nCommerce’s determination to use one assessment rate and to\n\ninstruct Customs to cap the assessment comports with the statute.\n\nBecause the court finds no effort to segregate cap and post-cap\n\nentries is necessary, the issue of whether MFI and MIC, basically\n\nthe pre- and post-cap period affiliates, should receive separate\n\nassessment rates is mooted.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n     This matter is remanded for Commerce to reconsider the\n\nfollowing issues: 1) the assessment rate for entries made after\n\nthe Final Results, 2) the matching of costs to sales on a fiscal\n\nyear basis, 3) the date of sale, and 4) the CEP profit\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 32\n\n\ncalculation.

Final Results, 63 Fed.\n\nReg. at 7,399-7,400.\n\n     Given generally rising costs,4 TPC computed a separate cost\n\n\n     3\n          If sufficient quantities of goods are sold in the\ncountry of production above the cost of production, normal value\nwill be based on home country sales prices. If home country\nsales are not usable, Commerce may use third country sales or CV,\nwhich is based on COP, as normal value. See 19 U.S.C.\n§ 1677b(a).\n     4\n          By plaintiff’s calculations, fresh pineapple costs per\ncarton of CPF, computed using the Department’s net realizable\nvalue (“NRV”) method, rose by [ ]% from 1994 to 1995 and by [ ]%\nfrom 1994 to 1996. See Memo from Commerce (July 31, 1997), at\nSch. 1, C.R.

Notwithstanding TPC’s request, the\n\nDepartment calculated a single “average” COP and a single\n\n“average” CV based on costs of production computed over the\n\nperiod January 1, 1995, to June 30, 1996.    Final Results, 63 Fed.\n\nReg. at 7,399-7,400.    Plaintiffs allege that the calculation of a\n\nsingle, weighted-average cost over this period, and the use of\n\nthat cost for comparison to sales prices early in the period,\n\nresulted in significant distortions in the Department’s price-\n\ncost comparisons, including distortions in its determination of\n\nwhich sales should be disregarded as below cost and in the\n\nDepartment’s determination of CV.   Id. at 7,399.   Plaintiffs\n\nallege in particular that distortion occurred because the\n\nDepartment did not match up 1995 sales with the low 1994 costs\n\n\n\n\nrose by [ ]% from 1994 to 1995 and by [ ]% from 1994 to the first\nhalf of 1996.

Id. at 1036.\n\n     Second, almost all of the factors which the appellate court\n\nfound were missing in Fujitsu are present here.     Fujitsu involved\n\nmulti-input television receivers, id., not a one primary-input\n\nproduct, such as canned pineapple from raw pineapple.     In such a\n\ncase, Commerce must be particularly sensitive to changes in the\n\nprice of the raw commodity.     See e.g. Brass Sheet and Strip From\n\nthe Netherlands, 53 Fed. Reg. 23,431, 23,432-33 (Dep’t Commerce\n\n1988) (final LTFV determ.) (POR split to account for metal price\n\nrise).7    Next, the Fujitsu court noted no significant cost rise\n\nfrom the beginning to the end of the POR.     Fujitsu, 88 F.3d at\n\n1039.     Here, a cost rise of almost 50% occurred over eighteen\n\nmonths, notwithstanding the fact that there was a tremendous cost\n\nrise mid-review which moderated somewhat by June 1996.     See Pl.'s\n\nBr. at Tab C (reflecting monthly fresh pineapple costs from\n\n\n     6\n          Because the POR does not match up with TPC’s fiscal\nyear, this might necessitate a 6-month averaging period, but this\ndoes not seem greatly burdensome.\n     7\n          Defendant is incorrect that this was necessitated by\nthe difference in merchandise provision because similar, not\nidentical, merchandise was used for comparison. The Brass Sheet\nrespondents requested a circumstances of sales adjustment to\naccount for a 70% metals price rise. This was denied, and\nseparate foreign market values were computed for four-month\nperiods. Comparison U.S. sales were matched to the periods. See\nBrass Sheet 54 Fed. Reg. at 23,432-433.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                       PAGE 10\n\n\nJanuary 1995 to June 1996).\n\n     In the past, the Department has adjusted for changes in\n\ncosts over the POR or matched costs to POR sales more\n\nspecifically than it did here.   The court notes a few\n\nparticularly telling examples.   In Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon\n\nSteel Flat Products from Germany, for example, the Department\n\nrelied upon separate fiscal year costs and allocated expense data\n\nfor sales observations according to the year in which the sales\n\ntook place.   60 Fed. Reg. 65,264, 65,270 (Dep’t Commerce 1995)\n\n(final results of antidumping duty admin. rev.).8\n\n     Commerce admits that there is a basic principle that\n\nCommerce will utilize shorter cost reporting periods if markets\n\nexperience significant and consistent price declines.    See, e.g.,\n\nStatic Random Access Memory Semiconductors from Taiwan, 63 Fed.\n\nReg. 8,909, 8,920 (Dep’t Commerce 1998)(final LTFV determ.).\n\nCommerce has not explained why significant price rises are not\n\nworthy of such an adjustment.9\n\n\n     8\n          Defendant is incorrect that this was done only for the\ngeneral expenses calculation. It is apparent from the discussion\nthat separate fiscal year costs and expenses were used for all\nelements of constructed value because the respondent reported\nthem that way. See Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat\nProducts from Germany, 60 Fed. Reg. at 65,270.\n     9\n          Moreover, in the preliminary determination in Static\nRandom Access, the Department stated that it would generally\n\"compare sales and conduct the sales below cost test using annual\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 11\n\n\n      Finally, the Department cannot explain away the following\n\ncases.   In Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Man-Made Fiber\n\nfrom Taiwan, the Department did not use annual average unit costs\n\nwhere there was a significant variation between what was produced\n\nduring the POR and what was sold during the POR.   55 Fed. Reg.\n\n34,585, 34,596 (Dep’t Commerce 1990) (final LTFV determ.)\n\n[hereinafter “Sweaters”].   Instead the Department used the costs\n\nof the individual production runs (whether or not falling within\n\nthe POR) in which the subject merchandise was actually produced.\n\nId.   In Fresh and Chilled Atlantic Salmon from Norway, the\n\nDepartment found that a single average cost of cultivation (COC)\n\nshould not be calculated for the POR, stating:\n\n      [B]ecause no 1990-generation salmon were harvested\n      until 1991, averaging the COC for 1990-generation\n      salmon with the 1989-generation salmon could lead to\n      distortions in determining whether 1990-third country\n      sales were made at prices below cost. Moreover, given\n      the fluctuations of farmers' costs during the POR, the\n      ease with which different generations' COC can be\n      segregated, and the fact that we have calculated\n      separate 1990 and 1991 processing costs for respondent\n      Skaarfish, we believe it is reasonable to use separate\n\n\naverages. However, where prices have moved significantly over\nthe course of the POI, it has been the Department's practice to\nuse shorter time periods.\" Static Random Access Memory\nSemiconductors from Taiwan, 62 Fed. Reg. 51,442, 51,444 (Dep't\nCommere 1997) (prelim. determination of sales at LTFV) (emphasis\nadded). This statement further shows there is no reason to limit\nthe use of shorter cost reporting periods to instances when the\nmarket experiences price declines and not when it experiences\nprice increases.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                       PAGE 12\n\n\n     1990 and 1991 COCs.\n\n58 Fed. Reg. 37,912, 37,913 (Dep’t Commerce 1993) (final results\n\nof antidumping duty admin. review) (emphasis added).\n\n     It is insufficient to cast away previous decisions on the\n\nbasis that the extent of the distortion was not noted.   This\n\ncannot be a way to insulate inconsistent decisions from review.\n\nWhile it is certainly true that the need to use monthly averages\n\ngenerally may be restricted to cases of hyper inflation, see\n\nAsociacion Colombiana de Exportadores de Flores v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2347535\"><a href=\"/opinion/2347535/asociacion-colombiana-de-exportadores-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Int'l Trade 1998), even\n\nCommerce recognizes that there is a middle range choice of six\n\nmonths to one year averaging.   There is also the possibility of\n\nmatching costs more closely with sales, as various administrative\n\ndeterminations indicate.\n\n     Given the distortions in calculating COP and CV caused by\n\ninattention to the price rise for a single primary input product,\n\nand the lag between goods produced (in a one-day canning process)\n\nbut not sold until months later, Commerce must revisit this\n\nissue.\n\n     Commerce must reanalyze the data to determine whether TPC\n\nhas provided sufficient data to match costs to appropriate fiscal\n\nyear sales.   If it has, in the absence of any proper antidumping\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 13\n\n\npolicy reason10 for not doing this seemingly minimally burdensome\n\nand substantially less distortive comparison, Commerce must\n\nproceed as it has in the past and match fiscal year costs with\n\nsales.\n\nII.   Use of Date of Contract for Date of Third Country Sale\n\n      A.    Facts\n\n      In its antidumping analysis, Commerce identifies a \"date of\n\nsale\" for merchandise sold to the United States, the exporting\n\ncountry, and third countries.    In the Final Results, Commerce\n\nrecognized the existence of two dates associated with TPC's\n\nexport price (\"EP\") and third-country sales:    the earlier date of\n\ncontract and the later date of invoice.    See 63 Fed. Reg. at\n\n7,394.     Commerce examined these dates and found that all but five\n\nof the third country sales11 had identical terms in both the\n\ncontracts and the invoices.    Id.   Thus, Commerce determined that\n\nthe date of contract was the proper date of sale because the\n\ncontract, not the invoice, established the material terms of\n\n      10\n          Commerce's answer that respondents would only provide\npre-POR cost data when it suited them does not appear to be a\nsufficient reason. Commerce can ask for relevant cost data if\ncosts are either declining or rising significantly and it has not\nbeen stopped by such a concern in the past. See, e.g., Sweaters,\n55 Fed. Reg. at 34,596.\n      11\n          Five of [ ] third country sales had contract changes.\nGov't's Br. at 27. One of several hundred EP sales had changes.\nFinal Results, 63 Fed. Reg. at 7,394.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                                PAGE 14\n\n\nsale.    Id.\n\n        B.     Discussion\n\n        The first question to ask is what principle should guide\n\nCommerce in choosing the date of sale.          It appears undisputed\n\nthat in the past, in general, Commerce has looked to the date by\n\nwhich the essential terms of sale are fixed in order to determine\n\ndate of sale.      See Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. v. United\n\nStates, No. 97-08-01328, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">661461</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Ct. Int'l Trade\n\n1998) (citing cases).        This seems reasonable if one is trying to\n\ncompare sales in two markets or costs and sales.\n\n        There is no new statutory guidance on this point except for\n\nthe general statement that NV shall be the price \"at a time\n\nreasonably corresponding to the time of the sale used to\n\ndetermine the export price or constructed export price.\"          19\n\nU.S.C. § 1677b(a)(1)(A).          There was no regulation on point\n\napplicable to the investigation at issue.\n\n        On March 29, 1996, Commerce stated in an internal memorandum\n\nthat it had published proposed regulations which provide that the\n\nagency would normally establish the date of invoice as the date\n\nof sale.       Pl.'s Br. at Tab D.     Commerce further stated that it\n\nwas implementing this change immediately in all reviews initiated\n\nafter April 1, 1996.        Id.    The administrative review at issue\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 15\n\n\nhere was initiated on August 15, 1996.   Initiation of Antidumping\n\nDuty and Countervailing Duty Admin. Reviews, 61 Fed. Reg. at\n\n42,417.   The proposed regulations referenced by Commerce in its\n\nMarch 29, 1996, memorandum were ultimately issued as final\n\nregulations on May 19, 1997.   See Antidumping Duties;\n\nCountervailing Duties, 62 Fed. Reg. 27,296, 27,296 (Dep't Comm.\n\n1997) (\"Final Regulations\").   The Final Regulations, however,\n\nonly apply to reviews requested on or after July 1, 1997.     See 19\n\nC.F.R. § 351.701 (1998).   With regard to reviews conducted\n\npursuant to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (“URAA”), Pub. L.\n\nNo. 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994), but not formally subject to\n\nthe Final Regulations, Commerce stated, \"[P]art 351 will serve as\n\na restatement of the Department's interpretation of the\n\nrequirements of the Act as amended by the URAA.\"     Id.   In this\n\ncase, Commerce did not refer to the regulations as controlling,\n\nbut, rather, discussed the regulations as reflecting Commerce's\n\ncurrent practice with respect to date of sale.   Final Results, 63\n\nFed. Reg. at 7,394 n.2.\n\n     Notwithstanding its new policy preference to utilize the\n\ndate of invoice as the default date of sale, Commerce determined\n\nthat the date of contract for TPC's EP and third-country sales\n\nshould determine the date of sale.   Id. at 7,394.    In the Final\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 16\n\n\nResults, Commerce stated that its new preference for the date of\n\ninvoice would apply \"’absent satisfactory evidence that the terms\n\nof sale were finally established on a different date.’\"    Id.\n\n(quoting the Final Regulations, 62 Fed. Reg. at 27,349).     With\n\nregard to TPC, Commerce stated that it found sufficient evidence\n\nthat the terms of sale were established on a different date.      As\n\nnoted by Commerce, \"[t]he evidence on the record indicates that\n\nthere were changes to the contracted terms of TPC's POR sales for\n\nonly one out of several hundred EP sales, and five out of several\n\nhundred third country sales.\"   Id.   For this reason, Commerce\n\ndetermined that the date of contract should act as the date of\n\nsale because all material terms of sale were established at the\n\ntime of contracting.    Id.\n\n     Accepting this as a statement of policy that applied to this\n\nproceeding, it appears that the number of changes noted may not\n\nbe particularly probative of whether or not this is an industry\n\nin which renegotiation is common, or whether the terms of the\n\nsales were firmly set on the contract date.   Thus, why this was\n\naccepted as evidence warranting departure from the general\n\ninvoice date policy is not clear.\n\n     How the new policy is being applied remains something of a\n\nmystery.   Plaintiffs offer three examples of administrative\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 17\n\n\ndecisions that at least cause some concern that Commerce acted\n\ninconsistently in this case.

If there is another reason for rejecting\n\ninvoice date which Commerce did not have reason to state in the\n\ncases cited, it should state that reason.   Commerce must\n\nreconsider this issue and square its reasoning with its other\n\ncontemporaneous determinations.\n\nIII. Calculation of CEP Profit\n\n     A.    Facts\n\n     Under 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(c) and (d) (1994), CEP is adjusted\n\nfor various items which are expected to be found in the sales\n\nprice.12   One of the reductions to price for purposes of arriving\n\nat CEP is profit.   19 U.S.C. § 1677a(d)(3).\n\n     Profit is calculated according to 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)\n\n(1994), which reads:\n\n\n\n\n     12\n        CEP is a constructed United States price which is\ncompared to NV to determine if the merchandise at issue is being\nsold at less than fair value in the United States. CEP is\nintended to be an approximation of ex factory price, and it is\nused in place of export price when affiliated U.S. sellers,\nrather than the exporters, make the U.S. sales.

The Department\n\napparently adopted its method because total profit is generally\n\nnot computed on a per-unit basis, but is calculated in gross.\n\nTherefore, the Department divides the total profit in gross by\n\nthe total expenses in gross and multiplies by unit U.S. selling\n\nexpense for an individual sale to obtain a unit profit.\n\n     The statute’s drafters intended that profit would be\n\nallocated to U.S. sales in the same ratio as United States\n\nselling expenses are to total expenses (i.e., that the portion of\n\ntotal profit on a sale attributable to activities conducted in\n\nthe United States is equal to the ratio of the cost of those\n\nactivities to the cost of all activities generating the sales\n\nrevenue).   As explained in the Statement of Administrative Action\n\n(“SAA”),13 the profit to be deducted from the CEP is the profit\n\n“allocable to the selling, distribution, and further\n\n\n     13\n          The Statement of Administrative Action represents \"an\nauthoritative expression by the Administration concerning its\nviews regarding the interpretation and application of the Uruguay\nRound Agreements . . . The Administration understands that it is\nthe expectation of the Congress that future Administrations will\nobserve and apply the interpretations and commitments set out in\nthis statement.\" SAA, at 1.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 22\n\n\nmanufacturing expenses in the United States.”   SAA accompanying\n\nthe URAA, H.R. 103-5110, H.R. Doc. No. 316, Vol. 1, 103d Cong. 2d\n\nSess. (1994), at 823, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3773, 4163.\n\n“The profit to be deducted from the starting price in the U.S.\n\nmarket is that proportion of total profit equal to the proportion\n\nwhich U.S. manufacturing and selling expenses constitute of total\n\nmanufacturing and selling expense.”    SAA, at 824.\n\n     The Department does include U.S. imputed expenses in the\n\nnumerator of the applicable percentage or ratio but not in the\n\ndenominator.   See Final Results, 63 Fed. Reg. at 7,394.    The\n\nDepartment also excludes imputed expenses from the total actual\n\nprofit figure required by 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(D), which\n\nperforce represents total expenses deducted from total revenue.\n\nIt then uses the total expense figure for purposes of the\n\nstatutory ratio.    Commerce is not following the statutory formula\n\nprecisely.   It is focusing on creating symmetry in the ratio it\n\nconstructs, i.e., total profit to total expenses, as opposed to\n\nthe ratio established by the statute, total U.S. expenses to\n\ntotal expenses.    The question before the court, therefore, is\n\nwhether this is permissible.\n\n     Both parties’ briefs failed to cite the court’s decision\n\nwhich is most on point, U.S. Steel Group v. United States, 15 F.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                            PAGE 23\n\n\nSupp.2d 892, 896-98 (Ct. Int'l Trade 1998).14\n\n     B.   Discussion\n\n     In U.S. Steel, the court ruled that, under 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f), the statutory ratio applied to “actual profit” for\n\npurposes of calculating CEP profit must be calculated on a\n\nproportional basis.     15 F. Supp.2d at 896-98.   The court left\n\nundecided whether the “actual” profit calculation under 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(D) must include categories of expenses present in\n\nthe ratio.   See id. at 898 n.6.    The court indicated that\n\ndefendant had presented no argument that this was so.      Id.\n\n     In this action, defendant has attempted an explanation of\n\nwhy actual profit should not contain “imputed expenses” based on\n\nthe use of the word “actual” in 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(D), but\n\nnot elsewhere in the provision.     This is facially a plausible\n\nreason for the omission.     Commerce’s argument misses the mark,\n\nhowever, where it indicates that the statute and the SAA require\n\nthat total expenses in the statutory ratio applied to actual\n\nprofit must be exclusive of imputed expenses just because some\n\nform of total expenses is also used in the actual profit\n\n\n     14\n        This is a particularly egregious error on the part of\nthe Government, as the case is adverse to its position. Upon\ndiscovering the case during preparations for oral argument,\ncounsel should have advised opposing counsel and the court.\nFailure to do so impeded oral argument.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                           PAGE 24\n\n\ncalculation.\n\n     First, in the total actual profit provision, 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(D), the term “total expenses” is used simply to\n\nindicate the pool of sales from which to calculate actual profit.\n\nSecond, the SAA makes clear that the pool of sales involved is\n\nthe same for both total expenses in the ratio and total actual\n\nexpenses in the total actual profit calculation.    SAA, at 824-25.\n\nThird, the three alternatives for selection of a sales pool for\n\ncalculation of expenses found at 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(C) do\n\nnot relate directly to the selection of the categories of\n\nexpenses to be used in the ratio.    As with subsection\n\n1677a(f)(2)(D), it is the choice of the sales pool which is\n\nspecified, not categories of expenses.\n\n     Commerce has some flexibility in determining total U.S.\n\nexpenses under 19 U.S.C. §§ 1677a(d)(1)-(2), the figure which is\n\nused in the ratio calculation, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(B).   But if Commerce decides to include a category\n\nof expenses in calculating total U.S. expenses in the numerator,\n\nit must also include such expenses in the denominator of the\n\nratio, unless they are already represented in total expenses in\n\nsome other fashion.     See U.S. Steel, 15 F. Supp.2d at 898.    The\n\nstatutorily defined denominator represents a figure containing\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 25\n\n\nboth total U.S. expenses and the expenses attributable to the\n\nforeign like product sold in the home market.    See 19 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1677a(f)(2)(C)(i).    Commerce cannot arbitrarily remove part of\n\nthe total U.S. expenses from the statutory ratio.\n\n     The court concludes that there is some ambiguity in the use\n\nof the word “actual” in § 1677a(f)(2)(D).    It may not be an\n\nunreasonable interpretation to conclude that imputed expenses\n\nshould be excluded in the actual profit calculation, if that\n\nconstruction can be squared with the necessity of a properly\n\ncalculated statutory ratio.   It is a proper ratio that ensures\n\nproper allocation of profit to U.S. sales.    If the profit\n\nallocable to CEP is somewhat lower because U.S. expenses are made\n\nhigher by the addition of imputed expenses, this would not seem\n\nto be antithetical to the statute.   There is also nothing that\n\ncategorically prevents the inclusion of imputed expenses.\n\nRather, imputed expenses should be omitted from actual profit if\n\nthey duplicate expenses already accounted for.    Their inclusion\n\nis not per se incompatible with the use of the word “actual.”\n\nThe question is whether the imputed expenses represent some real,\n\npreviously unaccounted for, expense.\n\n     Commerce may not ignore the statutory language just because,\n\nfor administrative reasons, it has chosen a different starting\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 26\n\n\npoint for its profit calculation.   Of course, it may continue to\n\nuse a different form of calculation if the result comports with\n\nthe statute.   What Commerce must do in this case is to start with\n\nthe statutory scheme.   If its method of calculating U.S. expenses\n\nis not compatible with the new CEP statute, it must amend that\n\napproach.   It cannot ignore that “total expenses” in the\n\ndenominator includes both U.S. expenses and expenses allocable to\n\nthe foreign sold product.   See 19 U.S.C. § 1677a(f)(2)(C).     Of\n\ncourse, if the imputed expenses are simply a part of an expense\n\nwhich was allocated to U.S. sales, and that portion is fully\n\nretained as to the foreign sales as a part of “total expenses,”\n\nit is perforce included in the denominator of the ratio.    If this\n\nis so, Commerce needs to support this with citations to the\n\nrecord.15   Commerce has not established that the expenses at\n\nissue are already in the denominator and thus, has not\n\ndistinguished U.S. Steel.   This issue is remanded for calculation\n\nin accordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n        Commerce provides no record appendix with its brief, nor\ndid it cite to portions of the appendix provided by plaintiff.\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 27\n\n\nIV.   Use of a Single Assessment Rate\n\n      A.   Facts\n\n      If Commerce makes a final affirmative dumping determination\n\nand the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") makes a final\n\naffirmative injury determination, the statute requires that\n\nCommerce publish an antidumping order which directs Customs to\n\n\"assess an antidumping duty equal to the amount by which the\n\nnormal value of the merchandise exceeds the export price (or the\n\nconstructed export price) of the merchandise\" and to collect cash\n\ndeposits for estimated antidumping duties pending liquidation of\n\nentries.   See 19 U.S.C. § 1673e(a)(1),(3) (1994).   If an\n\nadministrative review is subsequently requested, the statute\n\nprovides that Commerce will \"review, and determine (in accordance\n\nwith paragraph (2)), the amount of any antidumping duty.\"     19\n\nU.S.C. § 1675(a)(1)(B) (1994).   \"[P]aragraph (2)\" provides that\n\nCommerce shall determine \"the normal value and export price (or\n\nconstructed export price) of each entry of the subject\n\nmerchandise\" and \"the dumping margin for each such entry.\"     19\n\nU.S.C. § 1675(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n      The statute also contains a provision entitled \"Deposit of\n\nestimated antidumping duty under section 1673b(d)(1)(B) of this\n\ntitle,\" which provides as follows:\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 28\n\n\n          If the amount of a cash deposit, or the amount of\n     any bond or other security, required as security for an\n     estimated antidumping duty under section 1673b(d)(1)(B)\n     of this title is different from the amount of the\n     antidumping duty determined under an antidumping duty\n     order published under section 1673e of this title, then\n     the difference for entries of merchandise entered, or\n     withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption before notice\n     of the affirmative determination of the Commission\n     [ITC] under section 1673d(b) of this title is published\n     shall be —\n\n               (1) disregarded, to the extent that the\n          cash deposit, bond, or other security is\n          lower than the duty under the order, or\n\n               (2) refunded or released, to the extent that\n          the cash deposit, bond, or other security is\n          higher than the duty under the order.\n\n19 U.S.C.A. § 1673f(a) (West Supp. 1999) (emphasis added).\n\n     Plaintiff argues that the statutes, read together, require\n\nCommerce to compute two assessment rates, one for the “cap\n\nperiod” (the period from Commerce's preliminary determination\n\nthrough the publication of the ITC's affirmative final\n\ndetermination) and one for the period after publication of the\n\nITC’s affirmative injury determination.\n\n     B.   Discussion\n\n     The court simply does not agree with plaintiffs’ argument.\n\n19 U.S.C.A. § 1673f(a) is a limitation on collection.    It does\n\nnot depend on the basic direction for deriving margins set forth\n\nin 19 U.S.C. § 1675(a)(2)(A).\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                          PAGE 29\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff is disturbed because high margins\n\nrelating to sales of merchandise entered during the cap period\n\nare part of the final average margin.   It categorizes this as\n\nimporting cap period duties to post-cap entries.     Putting aside\n\nthe usual problem, which may or may not exist in this case, of\n\nmatching sales and entries, Congress did not provide that dumping\n\nmargins during the cap period in excess of the anticipated amount\n\nof dumping (i.e., amounts in excess of the preliminary finding of\n\ndumping) should be disregarded in their entirety.    Rather,\n\nCongress provided that Commerce should disregard amounts in\n\nexcess of the preliminary finding of dumping \"for entries of\n\nmerchandise\" made during the cap period.   See 19 U.S.C.A. §\n\n1673f(a).   Congress has also provided that the agency shall\n\ndetermine the dumping margin for \"each such entry\" during the\n\nperiod of review.   19 U.S.C. § 1675(a)(2)(A)(ii).    The Final\n\nResults have complied with both of these provisions by\n\ndetermining dumping margins for each entry during the period of\n\nreview but capping the assessed duties during the cap period at\n\nthe amount of estimated antidumping duties.\n\n     Previously, this Court has held that Commerce's decision to\n\ndetermine the dumping margin by use of all sales during the\n\nperiod (even sales which occur during the cap period) \"will not\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 30\n\n\nnecessarily result in the violation of the statutory duty cap\n\napplicable to entries made between the preliminary less than fair\n\nvalue determination and the publication of the ITC's injury\n\ndetermination.\"   Ad Hoc Comm. of S. California Producers Of Gray\n\nPortland Cement v. United States, 19 C.I.T. 1398, 1407-08, 914 F.\n\nSupp. 535, 545 (1995).    In Ad Hoc, the plaintiff argued that the\n\nagency's decision to utilize all sales during the review period\n\nto determine the dumping margin violated 19 U.S.C. § 1673f(a).\n\nId. at 1405, 914 F. Supp. at 543.    The Court, however, saw no\n\nviolation because the agency indicated \"that it will instruct\n\nCustoms to liquidate the relevant entries at a rate no higher\n\nthan the cap, in accordance with 19 U.S.C. § 1673f(a) (1988).\"16\n\nId. at 1408, 914 F. Supp. at 545.\n\n     Commerce explained in the Final Results that the adoption of\n\nseparate assessment rates \"would raise concerns about possible\n\nmanipulation of data to avoid AD duties and unrestrained dumping\n\nof certain merchandise subject to an order.\"     Final Results, 63\n\nFed. Reg. at 7,394.     Furthermore, the cash deposits on entries\n\nduring the cap and post-cap periods are simply estimates of\n\n\n     16\n          The only change made to 19 U.S.C. § 1673f(a), by\namendment in 1996, was the replacement of the words \"cash\ndeposit\" for \"cash deposit, bond, or other security.\" Compare 19\nU.S.C. § 1673f(a) (1988) with 19 U.S.C.A. § 1673f(a) (West Supp.\n1999).\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                         PAGE 31\n\n\ndumping liability.      The actual assessment of antidumping duties\n\nis calculated in an administrative review under 19 U.S.C. §\n\n1675(a) after Commerce reviews actual sales data for the period\n\nin question.   Under 19 U.S.C. § 1675(a), there is no prohibition\n\nagainst reviewing actual sales data on entries made during the\n\ncap period.\n\n     As held in Ad Hoc, 19 CIT at 1408, 914 F. Supp. at 545,\n\nCommerce’s determination to use one assessment rate and to\n\ninstruct Customs to cap the assessment comports with the statute.\n\nBecause the court finds no effort to segregate cap and post-cap\n\nentries is necessary, the issue of whether MFI and MIC, basically\n\nthe pre- and post-cap period affiliates, should receive separate\n\nassessment rates is mooted.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n     This matter is remanded for Commerce to reconsider the\n\nfollowing issues: 1) the assessment rate for entries made after\n\nthe Final Results, 2) the matching of costs to sales on a fiscal\n\nyear basis, 3) the date of sale, and 4) the CEP profit\n\fCOURT NO. 98-03-00487                                        PAGE 32\n\n\ncalculation.
