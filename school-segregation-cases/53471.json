Chapter 6119, the Sewer District was officially organized and declared a\n\npolitical subdivision of the state of Ohio.4 The necessity for the Sewer District arose\n\nfrom “the increase in the amount of wastewater in the Metropolitan Cleveland area\n\nresulting from the increase in population and the expansion of industry * * *.” Exhibit\n\nA, ¶ 3, 1972 Judgment.\n\n       {¶6} The Sewer District was formed for “the establishment of a total waste water\n\ncontrol system for the collection, treatment and disposal of waste water within and\n\nwithout the District.” Id. at ¶ 4.      To effectuate that purpose, the Sewer District was\n\ncharged with, among other things, planning, financing, constructing, operating, and\n\ncontrolling “waste water treatment and disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all\n\nsewer regulator systems and devices, weirs, retaining basins, storm handling facilities,\n\nand all other water pollution control facilities of the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(c).\n\n       {¶7} The Sewer District’s initial plan of operation was amended by various\n\npetitions and court orders, culminating in a 1975 court order that constitutes the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s Charter (“Charter”).5 Under the Charter, the Sewer District\n\n       shall have authority pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised Code to\n       plan, finance, construct, maintain, operate, and regulate local sewerage\n\n\n       4\n        The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District was originally named the Cleveland Regional\nSewer District; its name was changed by court order to its current name in 1979.\n       5\n          Although the Charter has been amended by other court orders, the core of it remains and\ngoverns this case.\n\f       collection facilities and systems within the District, including both storm\n       and sanitary sewer systems.\n\nExhibit A, ¶ 5(m), 1975 Judgment.\n\n       {¶8} Exhibit A to the Charter recognizes the territory to be included in the Sewer\n\nDistrict was to include “that portion of Cuyahoga County presently served, or mainly\n\ncapable of being served by gravity, by sewers leading to the three wastewater treatment\n\nplants in the City of Cleveland plus the proposed Cuyahoga Valley Interceptor Sewer.”\n\nSewer District membership arose based upon the consenting member communities’ need\n\nto connect to and use those facilities.     The member communities include some from\n\nCuyahoga, Summit, Lorain, and Lake Counties.\n\n       {¶9} Under the Charter, the plan for operation of the Sewer District entails the\n\nconstruction, operation, and financing of District and local facilities.\n\n       The District will plan, finance, construct, operate and control wastewater\n       treatment and disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer\n       regulator systems and devices, weirs, retaining basins, storm water handling\n       facilities, and all other water pollution control facilities of the District * *\n       *.”\n\nExhibit A, ¶ 5(c), 1975 Judgment. The Charter provides the Sewer District’s Board of\n\nTrustees with authority to determine rates for sewage treatment and disposal in\n\naccordance with its terms. Id. at ¶ 5(f).\n\n       {¶10} With regard to local sewerage collection facilities, the Charter provides:\n\n       The District shall not assume ownership of any local sewerage collection\n       facilities and systems nor shall the District assume responsibility or incur\n       any liability for the planning, financing, construction, operation,\n       maintenance, or repair of any local sewerage collection facilities and\n\f       systems unless * * * specifically provided for in a written agreement\n       between the District and the respective local community.\n\nId. at ¶ 5(m).\n\n       {¶11}     The Charter provides the Sewer District with regulatory authority over “all\n\nlocal sewerage collections facilities and systems in the District, including both storm and\n\nsanitary sewer systems.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(1).       However, the Sewer District only has the\n\nauthority to “assume the responsibility for operating, maintaining, and repairing local\n\nsewerage collection facilities when requested to do so by a local community and upon\n\nmutually agreeable terms.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(2).       Likewise, the District is only authorized\n\nto construct local sewerage collection facilities and systems “when requested to do so by a\n\nlocal community and upon mutually agreeable terms.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(4).        With regard to\n\nplanning local sewerage collection facilities and systems, the Charter further charged the\n\nSewer District with developing a capital improvement plan:\n\n       The District shall develop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan\n       for regional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage\n       designed to identify a capital improvement program for the solution of all\n       inter-community drainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the\n       District.\n\nId. at ¶ 5(m)(3).\n\n       {¶12} For financing local sewerage collection facilities and systems, “[t]he method\n\nof financing particular projects shall be agreed to between the District and the respective\n\nlocal communities at the time the project is undertaken by the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(5).\n\n                                         III.   Facts\n\f       {¶13} In January 2010, the Sewer District’s Board of Trustees amended the\n\nDistrict’s Code of Regulations by enacting Title V, “Stormwater Management Code,”\n\nwhich created a “Regional Stormwater Management Program” (“the RSM Program”).\n\nUnder Title V, the Board defined the scope of its RSM Program, which included\n\n“planning, financing, design, improvement, construction, inspection, monitoring,\n\nmaintenance, operation and regulation” of its own defined “Regional Stormwater\n\nSystem.” Title V, Section 5.0501. The definition of “Regional Stormwater System” is\n\nexpansively written to include the following:\n\n       The entire system of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and\n       Stormwater Control Measures in the Sewer District’s service area that are\n       owned and/or operated by the Sewer District or over which the Sewer\n       District has right of use for the management of stormwater, including both\n       naturally occurring and constructed facilities. The Regional Stormwater\n       System shall generally include those watercourses, stormwater conveyance\n       structures, and Stormwater Control Measures receiving drainage from three\n       hundred (300) acres of land or more. The Sewer District shall maintain a\n       map of the Regional Stormwater System that shall serve as the official\n       delineation of such system.\n\nId. at Section 5.0218.\n\n       {¶14} The stated purpose of Title V is to “establish the Regional Stormwater\n\nManagement Program through which the District and each Member Community served\n\nby the Regional Stormwater Management Program shall work in a cooperative manner to\n\naddress stormwater management problems.” Id. at Section 5.0303. In broad terms, the\n\nRSM Program consists of the following:\n\n       All activities necessary to operate, maintain, improve, administer, and\n       provide Stormwater Management of the Regional Stormwater System and\n\f       to facilitate and integrate activities that benefit and improve watershed\n       conditions across the Sewer District’s service area.\n\nId. at Section 5.0219.\n\n       {¶15} As stated in Title V, the RSM Program was needed because\n\n       (a) Flooding is a significant threat to public and private property.\n\n       (b) Streambank erosion is a significant threat to public and private property,\n       water quality, wildlife, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\n       (c) Inadequate stormwater management damages the water resources of\n       Northeast Ohio, impairing the ability of these waters to sustain ecological\n       and aquatic systems.\n\n       (d) A watershed-based approach to stormwater management is necessary to\n       effectively and efficiently plan, design, construct, and maintain long-term\n       solutions to stormwater problems.\n\n       (e) An adequate funding source is necessary to provide a watershed-based\n       approach to stormwater management.\n\n       (f) Impervious surface on a given parcel relates to the volume, rate, and/or\n       pollutant loading of stormwater runoff discharged from that parcel.\n\n       (g) The measurement of impervious surface that causes stormwater runoff\n       provides an equitable and adequate basis for a system of fees for funding a\n       watershed-based approach to stormwater management.\n\nId. at Section 5.0301.\n\n       {¶16} The Sewer District intends to fund projects under the RSM Program through\n\nthe imposition of a stormwater fee.    The fee is based on the square feet of a property’s\n\nimpervious surfaces, which are defined in Title V as follows:\n\n       Developed surfaces that either prevent or significantly slow the infiltration\n       of water into the ground compared to the manner that such water entered\n       the ground prior to development, or which cause water to run off in greater\n       quantities or at an increased rate of flow than that present prior to\n       development. Impervious surfaces shall include, without limitation,\n\f       rooftops, traveled gravel areas, asphalt or concrete paved areas, private\n       access roads, driveways and parking lots, and patio areas.\n\nId. at Section 5.0210.\n\n       {¶17} “Based on analysis by the District of impervious surfaces on parcels\n\nthroughout the District’s service area, an impervious surface of three thousand (3,000)\n\nsquare feet shall be designated as one (1) Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) * * *.” Id.\n\nat Section 5.0706.\n\n       {¶18} For calculating the fee for residential properties, the Sewer District\n\nstructured a three-tiered scale based on the size of the residential parcel. Id. at Section\n\n5.0707. Residential parcels with less than 2,000 square feet of impervious surface will\n\nbe classified as equal to 0.6 of an ERU and will be charged $3.03 per month in 2013.    Id.\n\n Residential parcels with 2,000 to 3,999 square feet of impervious surface will be\n\nclassified as equal to 1.0 ERU and will be charged $5.05 per month in 2013.      Id. And\n\nresidential parcels with 4,000 or more square feet of impervious surface will be classified\n\nas equal to 1.8 ERUs and charged $9.09 per month in 2013.     Id.\n\n       {¶19} For nonresidential property owners, the Sewer District will individually\n\ndetermine their fees by measuring impervious surfaces on their parcels, and then\n\nmultiplying (1) the total number of ERUs for a given parcel (which will be derived from\n\ncalculating the total square feet of impervious surface divided by 3,000), by (2) the fee\n\nestablished per ERU, which is $5.05 per month in 2013. Id. at Section 5.0708.\n\f       {¶20} Title V requires that the collected fees be maintained in a separate account\n\n“dedicated to the implementation and administration of the Regional Stormwater Program\n\n* * *.” Id. at Section 5.0701.\n\n       {¶21} Title V exempts certain properties from the fees:                        public road\n\nrights-of-way; airport runways and taxiways; railroad rights-of-way; parcels with less\n\nthan 400 square feet of impervious surface; and “[p]arcels whose use has been designated\n\nas a Non-Self Supporting Municipal Function owned by Member Communities.” Id. at\n\nSection 5.0705.\n\n       {¶22} Title V also has a “Community Cost-Share Program,” which requires the\n\nSewer District to place a minimum amount of all funds collected from the fees in a\n\nseparate account for each of the 56 member communities to use for District-approved\n\nprojects to “promote or implement the goals and objectives” of Title V within the member\n\ncommunities.6 Id. at Sections 5.0901 and 5.0902.\n\n       {¶23} Credits are a part of Title V, and are available for applicants who maintain\n\nand operate stormwater-control measures. Id. at Section 5.0801. The credits consist of\n\n(1) stormwater-quantity credit, (2) stormwater-quality credit, (3) stormwater-education\n\ncredit, and (4) residential credit.    Credits can be combined for a maximum credit of 100\n\npercent. Id. at Section 5.084.\n\n\n\n       6\n         Title V set the minimum amount of funds that would go into the Community Cost-Share\nProgram’s account at 7.5 percent. However, the trial court ordered the Sewer District to increase the\namount to 25 percent.\n\f                                    IV. Procedural History\n\n       {¶24} In January 2010, on the same day that the District’s Board of Trustees\n\nenacted Title V, the Sewer District filed this action in the trial court seeking (1) a\n\njudgment declaring that the Sewer District had the authority to implement its RSM\n\nProgram with respect to all the member communities served by the District and (2) an\n\norder permitting the Sewer District to amend its Plan for Operation to include Title V.\n\nThe 56 member communities were named as defendants.\n\n       {¶25} The trial court allowed the intervening property owners to join the action;\n\nthey filed an answer and counterclaim.7 The intervening property owners sought, among\n\nother things, to permanently enjoin the Sewer District from implementing its RSM\n\nProgram.    The appealing communities filed an answer and counterclaims, in which they\n\nalso sought, among other things, to permanently enjoin the Sewer District from\n\nimplementing its RSM Program.\n\n       {¶26} In June 2010, the appealing communities filed a motion to dismiss for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction; the intervening property owners joined in the motion. In\n\ntheir motion, they contended, among other things, that the Sewer District could not obtain\n\njudgment because it failed to name as defendants the individual property owners within\n\nthe Sewer District’s service area.\n\n\n       7\n          Other parties were also permitted to intervene in the action. The additional intervenors\nincluded Richard Lennon, Bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland in his capacity of Trustee of an Implied\nCharitable Trust, the Catholic Cemeteries Association of the Diocese of Cleveland, and the Cleveland\nMunicipal School District Board of Education.\n\f         {¶27} The trial court denied the motion, and stated in regard to the failure to join\n\nclaim, that there was no necessity that the Sewer District had to name all the property\n\nowners in the District because they were represented by the public officials of their\n\nrespective communities.\n\n         {¶28} The parties filed motions for summary judgment.          The Sewer District\n\nmoved for partial summary judgment, seeking a determination that, under its Charter and\n\nstatutory authority, it properly enacted Title V.   The appealing communities, intervening\n\nproperty owners, and other defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment on that\n\nissue.    The issue of the validity and implementation of the stormwater fee was reserved\n\nfor trial.\n\n         {¶29} In April 2011, the trial court issued its ruling on the summary judgment\n\nmotions, finding that the Sewer District had the authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 and its\n\nCharter to enact its RSM Program.\n\n         {¶30} In late 2011, a bench trial was had on the issue of the validity and\n\nimplementation of the stormwater fee.         In February 2012, the trial court issued an\n\nopinion in which it found that the stormwater fee (1) was authorized under R.C. Chapter\n\n6119, (2) was not restricted by the Sewer District’s Charter, (3) was not an unauthorized\n\ntax, and (4) did not violate the parties’ equal protection rights.   The court further found\n\nthe methodology used to calculate and impose the fee was constitutional.\n\n         {¶31} But the court found that there was no rational basis for the Sewer District’s\n\ndisparate treatment of nonresidential, as compared to residential, property owners.      The\n\fcourt also found that the 7.5 percent minimum allocation into the Cost-Share Program\n\nwas unfair to the member communities, and that it should be no less than 25 percent.\n\n       {¶32} Moreover, relative to the stormwater education credit, the court ordered that\n\nthe Sewer District “shall provide the school systems with appropriate curriculum for each\n\nof grades 1–12 to achieve the stated purposes of the credit.”       The court also ordered,\n\nrelative to the credits in general, that the Sewer District “shall submit a plan or formula\n\nproviding for the accrediting of costs of a licensed engineer in completing any\n\napplications for credits under the stormwater Fee Credit Manual.”\n\n       {¶33} Post-trial proceedings were had relative to the trial court’s orders.   During\n\nthose proceedings, the Sewer District submitted draft revisions to Title V, to which the\n\nappealing communities and intervening property owners objected. In June 2012, the\n\ntrial court issued a supplemental journal entry, in which it adopted the Sewer District’s\n\nrevisions.\n\n       {¶34} The appellants filed a motion for reconsideration based on the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court’s then-recent ruling in Drees Co. v. Hamilton Twp., 132 Ohio St.3d 186,\n\n2012-Ohio-2370, 970 N.E.2d 916, which was issued approximately three months after the\n\ntrial court’s 2012 ruling. The trial court denied the motion.\n\n  V. The Appealing Communities and Intervening Property Owners’ Assignments of\n                                    Error\n\n       {¶35} The appealing communities and intervening property owners have assigned\n\nthe following as errors:\n\fI. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nCounterclaims, to the extent that they sought permanently to enjoin the\nSewer District from imposing and collecting its unlawful “Stormwater Fee.”\n\nII. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nCounterclaims, to the extent that it sought permanently to enjoin the Sewer\nDistrict from undertaking a comprehensive Stormwater Management\nProgram (i.e., its Title V) for which it has no authority under R.C. Chapter\n6119.\n\nIII. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and the Property Owners’\nCounterclaims to the extent that they sought permanently to enjoin the\nSewer District from undertaking an SMP8 not authorized by its Charter.\n\nIV. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nCounterclaims, to the extent that they sought permanently to enjoin the\nSewer District from undertaking its SMP, because that SMP, as applied,\nviolates numerous Ohio and Federal Constitutional provisions.\n\nV. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nmotion to dismiss because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\ndue to Plaintiff’s failure to join all necessary parties in the action.\nVI. The trial court erred when it oversaw amendments to Title V after\nholding a trial and after its February 2012 Opinion declaring the rights of\nthe parties.\n\n            VI. The Sewer District’s Cross-Assignments of Error\n\n{¶36} In its cross-appeal, the District has assigned the following as errors:\n\nI. The trial court erred in finding that there is no rational basis for\ndisparate treatment of residential and nonresidential property owners with\nrespect to the stormwater fee.\n\nII. The trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to provide\nthe school systems with appropriate curricula for grades 1–12 to further the\nstated purpose of the stormwater education credit set forth in Title V.\n\n\n\n8\n    Stormwater management program.\n\f       III. The trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to accredit\n       costs of licensed engineers in completing nonresidential property owners’\n       applications for credits available under Title V.\n\n       IV. The trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to revise, or\n       to increase the amount of, the community cost-share set forth in Title V.\n\n                                  VII.   Law and Analysis\n\n       A.     The Appellants’ Appeal\n\n      1.     The Stormwater Management Program and the Stormwater\n             Fee Under R.C. Chapter 6119 and the District’s Charter.\n\n      {¶37} Appellants’ first, second, and third assignments of error relate to the\n\nauthority of the Sewer District to implement Title V and the RSM Program, along with its\n\nassociated stormwater fee.\n\n       {¶38} In their first assignment of error, the appellants contend that the stormwater\n\nfee is an unlawful tax.   They further argue that even if it is not an unlawful tax, it is not\n\nauthorized under R.C. 6119.09.      In their second assigned error, the appellants contend\n\nthe Sewer District has no authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 for undertaking a\n\ncomprehensive stormwater management program. In their third assignment of error, the\n\nappellants argue that the RSM Program is not authorized by the Sewer District’s Charter.\n\n       {¶39} Appellate review of summary judgment is de novo, governed by the\n\nstandard set forth in Civ.R. 56. Comer v. Risko, 106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559,\n\n833 N.E.2d 712, ¶ 8. Under Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is appropriate when (1) no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact exists, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law, and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving\n\fparty, reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving\n\nparty. Appellate review of a trial court’s determinations regarding questions of law in a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action are also reviewed de novo. Arnott v. Arnott, 132 Ohio St.3d\n\n401, 2012-Ohio-3208, 972 N.E.2d 586.\n\n      {¶40} The District is a “creature of statute” whose authority is strictly limited to\n\nthe powers specifically conferred upon it or clearly implied by the statute. See In re\n\nGuardianship of Spangler, 126 Ohio St.3d 339, 2010-Ohio-2471, 933 N.E.2d 1067, ¶ 17;\n\nD.A.B.E., Inc. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Bd. of Health, 96 Ohio St.3d 250, 2002-Ohio-4172,\n\n773 N.E.2d 536.     “Implied powers are those that are incidental or ancillary to an\n\nexpressly granted power; the express grant of power must be clear, and any doubt as to\n\nthe extent of the grant must be resolved against it.” Spangler at ¶ 17. The Sewer\n\nDistrict does not have the power to extend the authority conferred on it by the General\n\nAssembly. D.A.B.E., Inc. at ¶ 38.\n\n       {¶41} The appellants contend that the Sewer District was “utterly without statutory\n\npower under R.C. Chapter 6119 to enact Title V * * *.”     They cite the following reasons\n\nin support of their contention: (1) the Sewer District had no express authority for its RSM\n\nProgram under R.C. Chapter 6119; (2) the Sewer District’s program is not in keeping\n\nwith the purposes of R.C. Chapter 6119 as set forth in R.C. 6119.01; (3) other agencies\n\nsuch as watershed districts and conservancy districts are charged with dealing with\n\nstormwater-related issues; and (4) the definition of waste water in both R.C. 6119.011\n\nand the Charter demonstrate that the Sewer District’s RSM Program was not authorized.\n\f       {¶42} The first rule of statutory construction requires courts to look at a statute’s\n\nlanguage to determine its meaning.       If the statute conveys a clear, unequivocal, and\n\ndefinite meaning, interpretation comes to an end, and the statute must be applied\n\naccording to its terms.   Lancaster Colony Corp. v. Limbach, 37 Ohio St.3d 198, 199, 524\n\nN.E.2d 1389 (1988).\n\n       {¶43} Pursuant to R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B), the purpose of a regional water and\n\nsewer district is for “either or both” of the following purposes:   “(A) [t]o supply water to\n\nusers within and without the district”; and “(B) [t]o provide for the collection, treatment,\n\nand disposal of waste water within and without the district.”       “Waste water” is defined\n\nas “any storm water and any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other\n\npollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water.”      R.C. 6119.011(K).\n\nEssentially, the statutory terms authorize the Sewer District to collect, treat, and dispose\n\nof waste water entering the sewer system.\n\n       {¶44} The term waste water necessarily means water containing waste.           Under\n\nR.C. 6119.011(K), “waste water means” “any storm water containing sewage or other\n\npollutants.”   (Emphasis added.) Reith v. McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d\n\n709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226 (1st Dist.). Indeed, the District’s own “waste\n\nwater” definition in Titles I, II, and IV of its code of regulations recognizes it as a\n\n“combination of water-carried waste * * * together with such ground, surface or storm\n\nwater as may be present.”\n\f       {¶45} The General Assembly created regional sewer districts to “collect, treat, and\n\ndispose” of “waste water.”     Implicit in this express grant of power is that a Sewer\n\nDistrict is charged with removing sewage or other pollutants from storm water as well as\n\nother water containing such waste.     The definition of waste water cannot be read to\n\nauthorize the Sewer District to unilaterally exercise control over a broad range of\n\nstormwater-related issues that are not mentioned under and bear no resemblance to the\n\npowers conferred through R.C. Chapter 6119.\n\n       {¶46} R.C. Chapter 6119 does not authorize the District to implement a\n\n“stormwater management” program to address flooding, erosion, and other stormwater\n\nissues or to claim control over a “Regional Stormwater System.”        Such terms appear\n\nnowhere in R.C. Chapter 6119. Unlike the authority granted to the Sewer District, the\n\nGeneral Assembly gave specific stormwater-related authority to watershed districts and\n\nconservancy districts. See R.C. 6105.12 (providing watershed districts with authority to\n\nreview and recommend plans for the development of the water resources), and R.C.\n\n6101.04 (providing conservancy districts with authority to “prevent floods” and\n\n“regulating stream channels,” “irrigation,” “diverting * * * watercourses,” and “arresting\n\nerosion.”)\n\n       {¶47} In promulgating its RSM Program and in defining its terms, the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s board engaged in policy-making over matters that are legislative in nature.   By\n\nengaging in such actions, the Sewer District has gone beyond administrative rule-making\n\nand usurped power delegated to the General Assembly.\n\f       [T]he board of trustees of a regional water and sewer district may provide a\n       system of sanitary and/or storm water sewerage * * * for any part of the\n       area included within the district.\n\nR.C. 6119.19.\n\n       {¶48} With regard to the challenge to the stormwater fee being an unlawful tax,9\n\nwe are cognizant that other jurisdictions have found stormwater charges are fees.              We\n\nneed not decide whether this is the case under Ohio law.10 Rather, our focus is on\n\nwhether the Sewer District possesses the authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 to implement\n\nits RSM Program and the associated stormwater fee.\n\n       {¶49} The stormwater fee is being imposed by the Sewer District to advance Title\n\nV and address regional stormwater management problems that will serve to benefit the\n\nentire region.   The benefits to the community at large include decreasing flooding,\n\npreventing erosion, collecting sediment and debris, maintenance of various protective and\n\ncontrol structures with a “regional stormwater system.” Other benefits include\n\nimprovements in water quality, habitat for wildlife and reduction of future costs relating\n\nto stormwater management.         The Sewer District ignores the complete lack of any\n\nexpress grant of powers under R.C. Chapter 6119 relating to any of the RSM Program’s\n\nregulatory objects.\n\n\n        9\n          We note that R.C. 6119.17 and 6119.19 authorize the Sewer District to levy a tax for “any\nportion of the cost of one or more water resource projects[.]”\n        10\n           In Drees Co., 132 Ohio St.3d 186, 2012-Ohio-2370, 970 N.E.2d 916, the Ohio Supreme\nCourt set forth a number of factors for analyzing the substance of an assessment to determine\nwhether it is a fee or a tax.\n\f       {¶50} R.C. 6119.09 provides in part that, “[a] regional water and sewer district\n\nmay charge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges * * * for the use or services of any\n\nwater resource project or any benefit conferred thereby and contract * * * with one or\n\nmore persons * * * desiring the use or services thereof, and fix the terms, conditions,\n\nrental, or other charges * * * for such use or services.”   R.C. 6119.09.\n\n       {¶51} Additionally, R.C. 6119.06 governs the rights, powers, and duties of a\n\nregional water and sewer district, and provides that the district may, in relevant part, do\n\nthe following:\n\n       [a]cquire, construct, reconstruct, enlarge, improve, furnish, equip, maintain,\n       repair, operate, lease or rent to or from, or contract for operation by or for, a\n       political subdivision or person, water resource projects within or without\n       the district\n\nR.C. 6119.06(G);\n\n       [c]harge, alter, and collect rentals and other charges for the use of services\n       of any water resource project as provided in section 6119.09 of the Revised\n       Code. Such district may refuse the services of any of its projects if any of\n       such rental or other charges, including penalties for late payment, are not\n       paid by the user thereof * * *\n\nR.C. 6119.06(W); and\n\n       [d]o all acts necessary or proper to carry out the powers granted in Chapter\n       6119 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 6119.06(BB).\n\n       {¶52} A “water resource project” is defined under R.C. 6119.011(G) as “any waste\n\nwater facility or water management facility acquired, constructed, or operated by or\n\fleased to a regional water and sewer district or to be acquired, constructed, or operated by\n\nor leased to a regional water and sewer district under this chapter * * *.”\n\n       {¶53} In this case, we find the stormwater fee was unrelated to any use or services\n\nafforded to a property owner by a “water resource project.”      This case is wholly unlike\n\nthe tap-in fee charged in Wyatt v. Trimble Twp. Waste Water Treatment Dist., 4th Dist.\n\nAthens No. 1521, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 5749 (Nov. 3, 1992), where the charge was for\n\nthe installation of a plug-in system at the point where each premises was to be connected\n\nto an existing sanitary sewer and waste water treatment project as authorized by R.C.\n\n6119.09(Z), and which project was found necessary to bring the communities into\n\ncompliance with the Clean Water Act (Federal Water Pollution Control Act) (33 U.S.C.\n\n1251 et seq.).\n\n       {¶54} Here, there was no service connection being made from the properties to a\n\nwater resource project.   Further, Kyle Dreyfus Wells, the Sewer District’s manager of\n\nwatershed programs, testified that the stormwater management plan plays no more than\n\nan incidental role in municipal compliance with Clean Water Act regulatory obligations.\n\nTr. 1531-1534.\n\n       {¶55} Finally, while R.C. 6119.06(BB) authorizes the Sewer District to do all acts\n\nnecessary to carry out its authorized powers, the Sewer District cannot exceed the\n\nauthority granted.   While the Sewer District’s authority is broad, we are unable to\n\nconclude that the legislature intended to allow the Sewer District to expand upon its\n\fstatutory authority through Title V and its RSM Program and impose an unauthorized\n\ncharge.\n\n       {¶56} Here, the Sewer District improperly employed R.C. 6119.09 to generate\n\nrevenues for the costs of its RSM Program.     The waste water fee was not for the “use or\n\nservice” of a “water resource project.”    Accordingly, we find that the stormwater fee is\n\nnot a legitimate “rental or other charge” under R.C. 6119.09.\n\n       {¶57} We further recognize that in this case, there was no vetting as to the\n\nallowance for the Sewer District to fund its stormwater management program with a\n\nstormwater fee.   By implementing the stormwater fee, the Sewer District has effectively\n\ntaken upon itself to claim a share of community dollars, while other public entities such\n\nas school districts must continue their struggle to obtain public funding.\n\n       {¶58} We find that the General Assembly has not indicated any intent through\n\nR.C. Chapter 6119 to vest regional water and sewer districts with the authority to adopt a\n\nstormwater management program or to implement the stormwater control measures set\n\nforth in Title V. The General Assembly did not intend to permit the Sewer District to\n\nexpound upon its own powers without any oversight, proclaim the scope and breadth of\n\nits authority over stormwater management issues, and impose an associated stormwater\n\nfee.   There is no doubt that with the increased development in the region over the last\n\nseveral decades, regulations are needed over the stormwater-related issues that plague the\n\nregion.   However, such regulatory authority must be explicitly granted by the General\n\fAssembly.     Therefore, we conclude the enactment of Title V exceeds the statutory\n\npowers conferred upon the District under R.C. Chapter 6119.\n\n       {¶59} The appellants further contend that the Sewer District’s RSM Program is not\n\nauthorized under the Charter for the following three reasons: (1) the Charter dealt with\n\nsanitary sewerage issues and considerations that “share no kinship” with the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s RSM Program; (2) Title V conflicts with Charter provisions limiting the Sewer\n\nDistrict to charging for sewer fees; and (3) Title V conflicts with Charter provisions\n\nprohibiting the Sewer District from assuming ownership, control, or responsibility for\n\nlocally controlled systems without the local community’s written consent.\n\n       {¶60} Consistent with R.C. Chapter 6119, the Charter set forth the Sewer District’s\n\npurpose of “the establishment of a total wastewater control system for the collection,\n\ntreatment and disposal of waste-water within and without the District.” Exhibit A, ¶ 4,\n\n1975 Judgment. The Charter’s provisions pertain to the operation, construction, and\n\nfinancing of the Sewer District’s sewage treatment and other water pollution control\n\nfacilities, as well as local sewerage collection facilities and systems.     The Charter\n\nprovides the Sewer District with authority over “wastewater treatment and disposal\n\nfacilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and devices, weirs,\n\nretaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other water pollution control\n\nfacilities.” Id. at ¶ 5(c).\n\n       {¶61} Through its enactment of Title V, the District unilaterally defined a “local\n\nstormwater system” and created an expansive definition of a “regional stormwater\n\fsystem” over which it claims the power to establish and administer its RSM Program.\n\nThe expansive scope of the “regional stormwater system” goes far beyond the scope of\n\nsewage treatment and waste water handling facilities under the Charter and encompasses\n\nthe following:\n\n       The entire system of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and\n       Stormwater Control Measures in the Sewer District’s service area that are\n       owned and/or operated by the Sewer District or over which the Sewer\n       District has right of use for the management of stormwater, including both\n       naturally occurring and constructed facilities. * * *\n\nTitle V, Section 5.0218.\n\n       {¶62} Further, while the Sewer District may charge for “sewage treatment and\n\ndisposal,” the Charter does not authorize the District to impose a fee for a stormwater\n\nmanagement program.        The Charter contemplates charges assessed for the use of the\n\nSewer District’s wholly-owned treatment facilities, with rates encompassing planning\n\nexpenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and capital costs for existing and future\n\nwaste-water handling facilities. Exhibit A, ¶ 5(f), 1975 Judgment.\n\n       {¶63} Insofar as the Charter authorizes the district to assume the ownership,\n\nresponsibility, or liability for any local sewerage collection facilities and systems, it may\n\ndo so only at the request of the local community and upon mutually agreeable terms\n\nprovided for in a written agreement. Id. at ¶ 5(m)(2) and (4).        With regard to local\n\nsewerage and collection facilities, while the Sewer District was charged with developing\n\na “detailed integrated capital improvement plan for regional management of wastewater\n\ncollection and storm drainage,” it was within the confines of its authority “to plan local\n\fsewerage collection facilities and systems pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised\n\nCode.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(3).      Also, the method of financing particular projects must be\n\n“agreed to between the District and the respective local communities at the time the\n\nproject is undertaken by the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(5).\n\n       {¶64} Finally, in order to amend its Charter, the Sewer District is required to go\n\nthrough the Charter amendment process of R.C. 6119.051. “The approved petition filed\n\nunder R.C. 6119.02 and the approved plan of operation for the district filed under R.C.\n\n6119.04 may only be amended or modified by the Common Pleas Court upon a petition\n\nbeing filed containing a request for such amendment or modification.” Kucinich v.\n\nCleveland Regional Sewer Dist., 64 Ohio App.2d 6, 410 N.E.2d 795 (8th Dist. 1979),\n\nsyllabus.    Any amendment to the Charter cannot exceed the authority conferred by R.C.\n\nChapter 6119.\n\n       {¶65} Here, the Sewer District’s board, whose composition is largely unknown to\n\nthe general public, met and decided the long-term future of all water management in the\n\nregion well into the next generation.\n\n       {¶66} There is no question the Sewer District and many of its individual board\n\nmembers have done great things over the years for the region. There is also no doubt\n\nthat there have been problems that must be addressed. The sheer size and power of the\n\nNortheast Ohio Regional Sewer District11 is daunting. The consent decree the District\n\nsigned with the Federal Environmental Agency in 2011 is enlightening:\n\n        11\n             Also known as “NEORSD.”\n\f        NEORSD serves all or part of 62 communities and over one million\npeople in a 350 square-mile tributary area, 80 square miles of which is\nserved by combined sewers. NEORSD is responsible for operation and\nmaintenance of 305 miles of interceptor sewers including 40 miles of\nintercommunity relief sewers.          The system includes 126 permitted\ncombined sewer overflow outfalls and 26 automated regulators. These\nfacilities were built as early as 1876.\n\n       NEORSD is responsible for operation and maintenance of three\nWWTPs [waste water treatment plants], Easterly, Southerly and Westerly,\nwhich were built in 1922, 1928, and 1922 respectively. Improvements to\nthese plants have been made continuously.\n\n      NEORSD is also responsible for operation and maintenance of the\nCombined Sewer Overflow Treatment Facility (CSOTF) located near the\nWesterly plant, which was constructed in 1983.\n\n       NEORSD states that it has invested over $2.0 billion in facilities and\ncollection system improvements since 1972, and has spent over $850\nmillion to reduce CSO discharges by nearly 50%.\n\n       NEORSD states that between 1972 and 2006, NEORSD constructed\nthe Northwest Interceptor, Cuyahoga Valley Interceptor, Southwest\nInterceptor and Heights/Hilltop Interceptor. These interceptors have\ndiverted approximately 1.65 billion gallons of sanitary flow out of the\ncombined system directly to the WWTPs.\n\n       In addition, NEORSD states that it has taken certain incremental\nsteps to reduce CSO discharges that it believes are in compliance with\nEPA’s CSO Policy. It states that these steps are:\n\n(a) NEORSD completed a system-wide CSO Facilities Plan Phase I Study\nin 1994;\n\n(b) Pursuant to its CSO NPDES Permit, NEORSD’s CSO Operational Plan\nwas submitted in 1998 and approved by Ohio EPA in 1999;\n\n(c) In 1995 NEORSD began developing its CSO Long Term Control Plan,\nwhich is embodied in separate Facilities Plans for the Mill Creek, Westerly,\nSoutherly and Easterly sewersheds. Facility planning efforts included\ninterceptor inspection and evaluation, extensive system investigation,\n\f      mapping and flow monitoring during facilities planning, and sewer and\n      stream modeling;\n\n      (d) NEORSD submitted for Ohio EPA approval the Mill Creek and\n      Westerly Facilities Plans in 1999, and the Southerly and Easterly Facilities\n      Plans in 2002;\n\n      (e) In 2008 NEORSD completed its studies of feasible alternatives to\n      minimize wet weather bypasses at the Southerly and Easterly WWTPs;\n\n      (f) Implementation of the District’s facilities plans has included\n      rehabilitation and early action projects in all three treatment plant service\n      areas. The early action projects have controlled approximately 480 million\n      gallons of CSO;\n\n      (g) NEORSD has completed construction of the major portion of the Mill\n      Creek Tunnel, which is designed to reduce overflows to Mill Creek by over\n      500 million gallons per year.\n\n      NEORSD states that it has imposed appropriate and necessary rate increases\n      to pay for these efforts. The District states that it has raised rates in 17 out\n      of the last 20 years, in amounts varying from 4.5% to 22.2%, resulting in\n      rate increases during this period of 350%.\n\nSee Case: 1:10-cv-02895-DCN Doc #: 23 Filed: 07/07/11.\n\n      {¶67} The view that an entity with the size and expanse of the Sewer District could\n\nredefine its own existence through Title V from the confines of a boardroom with limited\n\noversight and review is not supported by R.C. Chapter 6119. While local school boards\n\nand municipal entities struggle with limited budgets, the Sewer District expands its\n\nauthority and imposes its will on constituents with limited oversight and control.\n\nClearly, if regional entities like the Sewer District are going to expand their power and\n\nredefine their purpose, albeit for a claimed good purpose, it should be accomplished by\n\nthe legislature’s defining the terms and the scope of authority of these entities to make\n\fthese changes. Further, long-term stormwater management is interrelated with regional\n\nexpansion and what some have termed “urban sprawl.” Clearly, if one or the other is to\n\nbe comprehensively addressed, it must be done with authority conferred by the\n\nlegislature.\n\n       {¶68} Accordingly, we find that Title V exceeds the express statutory authority\n\ngranted to the Sewer District under R.C. Chapter 6119 and the authority conferred under\n\nthe Charter.       We further find that the stormwater fee is an unauthorized charge.\n\nAppellant’s first, second, and third assignments of error are sustained.\n\n       2.      Title V and Constitutional Provisions\n\n       {¶69} Having already sustained the first, second, and third assignments of error,\n\nwe need not address the constitutional challenges raised by appellants. Accordingly, we\n\nfind the fourth assignment of error is moot.\n\n       3.      Denial of Motion to Dismiss based on Failure to Join all Property\n               Owners\n\n       {¶70} For their fifth assigned error, the appellants contend that the trial court erred\n\nin denying their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because all of the\n\nindividual property owners were not named as parties.     We disagree.\n\n       {¶71} Civ.R. 19(A) governs “[p]ersons to be joined if feasible,” and provides in\n\npart as follows:\n\n              A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a\n       party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded\n       among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the\n       subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in\n       his absence may (a) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to\n\f       protect that interest or (b) leave any of the persons already parties subject to\n       a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent\n       obligations by reason of his claimed interest, or (3) he has an interest\n       relating to the subject of the action as an assignor, assignee, subrogor, or\n       subrogee.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       {¶72} Joinder of all the thousands of property owners was not feasible, and the\n\nproperty owners’ interests were protected by the community law directors. See R.C.\n\n733.53 (“[t]he city director of law, when required to do so by resolution of the legislative\n\nauthority of the city, shall prosecute or defend on behalf of the city, all complaints, suits,\n\nand controversies in which the city is a party, and such other suits, matters, and\n\ncontroversies as he is, by resolution or ordinance, directed to prosecute”).\n\n       {¶73} In light of the above, the fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       4.     Post-Trial Amendments\n\n       {¶74} In their sixth and final assignment of error, the appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred when it oversaw post-trial amendments to Title V.\n\n       {¶75} The trial court’s February 2012 judgment concludes, in part, as follows:\n\n“[t]he Court will set a conference within 30 days and hear proposed changes to Title V *\n\n* *.   Upon its conclusion, [the District] shall submit a proposed journal entry not\n\ninconsistent with this opinion.”\n\n       {¶76} The appellants filed notices of appeal from the February 2012 judgment, but\n\nthis court dismissed the appeals as not being taken from a final order because the trial\n\ncourt contemplated further action. N.E. Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. v. Bath Twp., 8th\n\fDist. Cuyahoga Nos. 98108 and 98112, motion Nos. 453509 and 453511, respectively.\n\nThe appellants filed motions to reconsider, which this court denied, stating as follows:\n\n       The trial court’s opinion on February 15, 2012 specifically directs that, at\n       the conclusion of a future hearing, the “[p]laintiff shall submit a proposed\n       journal entry not inconsistent with this opinion.” The opinion clearly\n       contemplates that future action must be taken before any judgment of the\n       court becomes final. Therefore, it is not an appealable order.\n\nId. at motion Nos. 453917 and 453855.\n\n       {¶77} In light of the above, the trial court’s February 2012 judgment was not its\n\nfinal judgment and its subsequent judgment issued in June 2012 was proper.                 The\n\nseventh assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.\n\n       B.   The Sewer District’s Cross-Appeal\n\n       {¶78} In the trial court’s February 2012 opinion, which it issued after the bench\n\ntrial, the court found that certain provisions in Title V needed to be modified; the court\n\ncharged the District with making the modifications before legally implementing Title V.\n\nThe District revamped the offending provisions, which were presented to the trial court in\n\na June 2012 report.   The trial court found the District’s revisions acceptable and adopted\n\nthem in its June 2012 final judgment. The District’s assignments of error relate to\n\nfindings the trial court made in its February 2012 opinion.\n\n       {¶79} Under its assignments of error, the District contends that (1) the trial court\n\nerred in finding that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between residential\n\nproperty owners and nonresidential property owners with respect to the stormwater fee;\n\n(2) the trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to provide the school\n\fsystems with appropriate curricula for grades 1–12; (3) the trial court had no legal basis\n\nfor requiring the District to come up with a formula for accrediting the costs of licensed\n\nengineers for completing any applications for credit; and (4) the trial court had no legal\n\nbasis for requiring the District to revise, or to increase the amount of, the community\n\ncost-share set forth in Title V.\n\n       {¶80} Since the trial court rendered its decision, the District voluntarily adopted\n\nchanges to Title V that rendered its assignments of error moot.     Generally, an appeal\n\nfrom a judgment with which the appellant has voluntarily complied renders the appeal\n\nmoot. Sunkin v. Collision Pro, Inc., 174 Ohio App.3d 56, 65-66, 2007-Ohio-6046, 880\n\nN.E.2d 947, citing Am. Book Co. v. Kansas, 193 U.S. 49, 52, 24 S.Ct. 394, 48 L.Ed. 613\n\n(1904).   In any event, because we have already determined that Title V is invalid, we\n\nneed not address the District’s assignments of error.\n\n       {¶81} Nonetheless, we do express concern over the trial court’s revisions to Title\n\nV in an effort to correct what the court viewed as infirmities. It is not within the\n\nprovince of the court to draft such measures.     Moreover, any expansion of the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s powers, including the allowance for implementation of a stormwater\n\nmanagement program and the parameters thereof, are matters that must be determined by\n\nthe legislature.\n\f                                      VIII. Conclusion\n\n       {¶82} The trial court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss is affirmed. We reverse\n\nthe   trial   court’s   decision   granting   partial   summary judgment      in   favor   of\n\nplaintiff-appellee/cross-appellant and its decision denying the motion for a permanent\n\ninjunction.    The judgment of the trial court on the declaratory action is reversed;\n\njudgment is entered in favor of appellants as follows:\n\n       1.      The Sewer District is enjoined from implementing Title V and its Regional\n\n               Stormwater Management Program.           The Sewer District had no authority\n\n               under R.C. Chapter 6119 or its Charter to enact it.\n\n       2.      The Sewer District is enjoined from implementing, levying, and collecting\n\n               its stormwater fee.     The Sewer District has no authority under R.C.\n\n               Chapter 6119 or its Charter to enact said fee.\n\n       {¶83} Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n\n        It is ordered that appellants recover from appellee costs herein taxed.\n\n        The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n        It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common\n\npleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of\n\nthe Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\n\nSEAN C. GALLAGHER, JUDGE\n\fKENNETH A. ROCCO, J., CONCURS (WITH SEPARATE OPINION);\nLARRY A. JONES, SR., P.J., DISSENTS (WITH SEPARATE OPINION)\n\n\nKENNETH A. ROCCO, J., CONCURRING:\n\n        {¶84} While I agree with the majority opinion’s disposition of this appeal, I write\n\nseparately only because I disagree with the majority opinion’s characterization of the\n\nSewer District’s actions in ¶ 47. Using the word “usurp” to describe what the Sewer\n\nDistrict sought to accomplish is too strong.\n\n        {¶85} In my view, the district simply was making a well-meaning effort to deal\n\nwith Northern Ohio’s need for clean water. That need should be a high priority in this\n\nstate, especially in light of the fact that Lake Erie and its watercourses arguably are\n\nOhio’s greatest natural resource.\n\n        {¶86} As the majority opinion suggests, the need for clean water is one that can no\n\nlonger be handled locally. The Ohio legislature, nevertheless, delegated most of the\n\nresponsibility of safeguarding this natural resource to local governments, thus abdicating\n\nits proper role. Nature abhors a vacuum. So, too, apparently, does the Sewer District.\n\nBecause I believe that the District merely was making a misguided attempt to deal with a\n\ncomprehensive problem that affects the health and welfare of the citizens of this area, I\n\nwould choose to describe the Sewer District’s action as having inappropriately assumed\n\nthe mantle of responsibility from which the government of the state of Ohio has walked\n\naway.\n\fLARRY A. JONES, SR., P.J., DISSENTING AND CONCURRING:\n\n        {¶87} Respectfully, I dissent as to the decision to sustain the first, second, and\n\nthird assignments of error of appellants’ appeal.          I concur as to the decision to overrule\n\n(1) appellants’ fifth assignment of error regarding the denial of their motion to dismiss\n\nbased on failure to join all property owners and (2) appellants’ sixth assignment of error\n\nregarding the trial court’s jurisdiction to make post-trial amendments.            Moreover, while I\n\nagree with the majority that the appellees’ cross-appeal is moot, I do not share the same\n\nconcerns about issues raised in the appeal as the majority does.\n\nI. Authority for Title V\n\n        {¶88} The powers granted to a regional water and sewer district under R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 are “very broad.” Wyatt v. Trimble Twp. Waste Water Treatment Dist.,\n\n4th Dist. Athens No. 1521, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 5749, *6 (Nov. 3, 1992). The\n\nmajority agrees that the “Sewer District’s authority is broad,” but it is “unable to conclude\n\nthat the legislature intended to allow the Sewer District to expand its statutory authority\n\nthrough Title V and its RSM Program and impose an unauthorized charge.” Majority\n\nOpinion, ¶ 55.\n\n        {¶89} I do not believe that Title V is an unlawful expansion of the District’s\n\nstatutory authority; rather, I believe that it is specifically authorized under the governing\n\nstatutory authority, both procedurally12 and as I will discuss in more detail, substantively.\n\n\n        12\n           See R.C. 6119.051(A), providing that “[a]t any time after the creation of a water and sewer\ndistrict, the district, after action by its board of trustees, may file a petition in the court of common\npleas requesting the order of such court permitting the district to: (A) Increase or add to its purposes\n\f Further, I believe that the District’s Program is authorized under its Charter.            I also do\n\nnot believe that the fee imposed under the Program is an unauthorized charge.\n\nExpress Authority under R.C. Chapter 6119\n\n       {¶90} The purpose of a regional water and sewer district is for “either or both” of\n\nthe following purposes: “(A) [t]o supply water to users within and without the district”;\n\nand “(B) [t]o provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water within and\n\nwithout the district.”     R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B).          “Waste water” is defined as “any\n\nstorm water and any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or\n\ncontaminants derived from the prior use of the water.”                  (Emphasis added.)        R.C.\n\n6119.011(K).\n\n       {¶91} The majority holds that under the statutory definitions, in order to qualify as\n\nwaste water, storm water must be mixed with water containing sewage or industrial waste\n\nor other pollutants or contaminants.       I disagree.\n\n       {¶92} It is true that, generally, the word “and” is a conjunctive. McIntire v.\n\nPatrick, 85 Ohio Misc.2d 83, 87, 684 N.E.2d 391, 1997 Ohio Misc. LEXIS 274 (C.P.).\n\nBut the conjunctive “and” and the disjunctive “or” are sometimes used interchangeably.\n\nSee Skiba v. Mayfield, 61 Ohio App.3d 373, 378, 572 N.E.2d 808 (11th Dist.1989).\n\n“[W]e are not empowered to read into the law that which is not there, and it is our duty to\n\ngive effect to the plain meaning of the statute’s language.”               (Citation omitted.) Id.\n\n\nheretofore approved by the court so long only as its purposes are those described in section 6119.01 of\nthe Revised Code * * *.”\n\fStatutes should not be construed to produce unreasonable or absurd results. State ex rel.\n\nDispatch Printing Co. v. Wells, 18 Ohio St.3d 382, 384, 481 N.E.2d 632 (1985).\n\n       {¶93} In interpreting the definition of R.C. 6119.011(K) under its plain language, I\n\nwould find that waste water is (1) “any storm water” or (2) “any water containing sewage\n\nor industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the\n\nwater.”\n\n       {¶94} I believe to find otherwise would create an absurd result.      Specifically, if\n\nthe District could manage storm water only if it was mixed with polluted or contaminated\n\nwater, then it would also necessarily only be able to manage polluted or contaminated\n\nwater if it was mixed with storm water. I do not think that the General Assembly\n\nintended such a result.\n\n       {¶95} I am not persuaded by the majority’s reliance on Reith v. McGill Smith\n\nPunshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226 (1st Dist.), which\n\nwas decided on a statute-of-limitations issue on the plaintiffs-property owners’ claims of\n\nnegligence and trespass due to flooding of their driveway, yard, and home.\n\n       {¶96} In deciding the limitations issue, the court had to consider whether there was\n\na “legal distinction between storm water when it is above the ground and storm water\n\nwhen it is channeled through underground pipes.”    Id. at ¶ 24.   The plaintiffs contended\n\nthat surface water becomes sewer water once it enters an underground pipe, but the court\n\ndisagreed, stating that “[s]ewage is defined as any substance containing excrement, while\n\nwaste water means any storm water containing sewage or other pollutants.” Id. at ¶ 29.\n\fThe majority relies on this narrow statement for its finding that storm water must contain\n\npollutants or contaminants.\n\n       {¶97} But, the issue in Reith differed from the issue here, and if the First Appellate\n\nDistrict intended to hold that in all instances waste water can only be storm water mixed\n\nwith polluted water, I respectfully disagree.\n\n       {¶98} Morever, I am not persuaded by the majority’s citation to the District’s\n\ndefinitions in other Titles of its Code of Regulations to support its finding that waste\n\nwater is limited to only storm water mixed with pollutants or contaminants.             The\n\ndefinitions in those Titles apply to those Titles.     I believe for our purpose, we are\n\nrestricted to the definition of waste water set forth in R.C. 6119.011(K).       Under that\n\nsection, I would find that waste water can be (1) “any storm water” or (2)       “any water\n\ncontaining sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from\n\nthe prior use of the water.”\n\n       {¶99} The majority states that the General Assembly has charged other statutorily\n\ncreated agencies such as watershed districts under R.C. 6105.12 or conservancy districts\n\nunder R.C. 6101.04 to deal with stormwater-related issues.        But neither a watershed\n\ndistrict created under R.C. 6105.12 nor a conservancy district created under R.C. 6101.04\n\nhave the exclusive authority to implement a program such as the District’s Program.\n\nTherefore, the issue in this case is whether the District has the authority to implement its\n\nProgram.\n\f       {¶100} I am also not persuaded by the proposition that the governing statutes\n\nmandate that waste water be “‘collected’ and ‘treated’ and ‘disposed of,’ conjunctively,”\n\nand that a regional sewer district is an “entity that exists to do that “‘collecting, treating,\n\nand disposing of waste water.’”\n\n       {¶101} In my view, the plain meaning of R.C. 6119.01(B) grants the District\n\nauthorization to collect, treat, or dispose of waste water.   To hold that it must do all three\n\nconjunctively would create absurd results.\n\nTitle V vis-a-vis the District’s Charter\n\n       {¶102} The Charter states that the District’s purpose was the “establishment of a\n\ntotal wastewater control system for the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater\n\nwithin and without the District * * *.” Exhibit A to 1975 Charter, ¶ 4. The Charter\n\nfurther provides that the District\n\n       shall have regulatory authority over all local sewerage collection facilities\n       and systems in the District, including both storm and sanitary sewer\n       systems. This authority shall be exercised by the District through rules and\n       regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Chapter 6119 of\n       the Ohio Revised Code.\n\nId. at ¶ 6(m)(1).\n\n       {¶103} Moreover, the Charter charged the District with developing a plan for\n\nregional storm water management:\n\n       [t]he District shall develop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan\n       for regional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage\n       designed to identify a capital improvement program for the solution of all\n       intercommunity drainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the District.\n\fId. at ¶ 5(m)(3).\n\n       {¶104} The charge given to the District in its Charter “shares kinship” with Title\n\nV, which stated purpose is to “establish the Regional Stormwater Management Program\n\nthrough which the District and each Member Community served by the Regional\n\nStormwater Management Program shall work in a cooperative manner to address\n\nstormwater management problems.”          Title V, Section 5.0303.     Further, Title V\n\ndescribes the Program as\n\n       [a]ll activities necessary to operate, maintain, improve, administer, and\n       provide Stormwater Management of the Regional Stormwater System and\n       to facilitate and integrate activities that benefit and improve watershed\n       conditions across the District’s service area.\n\nId. at Section 5.0219.\n\n       {¶105} Given the above, I would hold that the District’s Charter authorized\n\nimplementation of its Program as set forth in Title V.\n\nOwnership, Control, or Responsibility for Locally-Controlled Systems without Local\nCommunity’s Written Consent\n\n       {¶106} I do not see the District’s Program as conflicting with the requirement, as\n\nstated in the Charter, that the District cannot own, control, or be responsible for\n\nlocally-controlled systems without the local community’s written consent.\n\n       {¶107} Title V explicitly provides that the District’s member communities will\n\nremain responsible for owning and maintaining their own facilities and systems.      For\n\nexample, section 5(k) of the Title provides as follows: “[i]ndividual suburban\n\ncommunities will retain ownership of all local suburban facilities, subject to the\n\fprovisions of subsection ‘m’ below.” Subsection m provides that the District will not be\n\nresponsible for any local sewerage collection facility absent written consent between the\n\nDistrict and the respective local community.\n\n       {¶108} Thus, under the plain language of Title V each member community will\n\nremain responsible for maintaining its local sewerage collection facilities and systems.\n\nTo that end, the District stipulated on the record that it will not undertake any\n\nconstruction projects under Title V, without the consent of the member community in\n\nwhich the project will be undertaken. See April 2011 opinion at 3; February opinion at\n\n12.\n\n                           II. The Stormwater Fee Under Title V\n\n       {¶109} I disagree with the majority’s finding that the stormwater fee is “not a\n\nlegitimate ‘rental or other charge’ under R.C. 6119.09.”    Majority Opinion, ¶ 56.\n\n       {¶110} The majority finds that Wyatt, 4th Dist. Athens No. 1521, 1992 Ohio App.\n\nLEXIS 5749, is completely distinguishable from this case because the issue there\n\ninvolved a tap-in fee for premises to be connected to an existing sanitary sewer and waste\n\nwater treatment project.   The fact remains, however, that the Fourth Appellate District\n\nconcluded that a sewer district’s powers under R.C. Chapter 6119 are “very broad.”      The\n\nbroadness, as it relates to fees or charges, is indicated by the very use of the words “other\n\ncharge” in R.C. 6119.09.    The “other charge” in Wyatt was a tap-in fee, while the “other\n\ncharge” here was a fee for stormwater management.           I believe both are permissible\n\nunder R.C. Chapter 6119.\n\f       {¶111} Further, I believe that the projects that will be funded through the fees in\n\nthis case are for the benefit of the member communities and property owners.\n\n       {¶112} For example, one of the District’s experts, Hector Cyre,13 was of the\n\nopinion that projects under the Program would “provide service to not only the member\n\ncommunities individually and cumulatively, but to the property owners within those\n\ncommunities.”\n\n       {¶113} Another example of the benefits of the District’s Program from the\n\ntestimony of two mayors from the non-appealing member communities.14 The mayors\n\ntestified about “serious” regional stormwater problems in their communities, such as\n\nhome and yard flooding, damage to the Metroparks, road damage, and degradation and\n\nsiltation of the Shaker Lakes and dams.         The mayors testified that they believed the\n\nDistrict’s Program will help to alleviate these problems and, thus, provide an “enormous\n\nbenefit” not only to their residents, but to residents of the region generally.\n\n       {¶114} Because I believe that the District’s Program was authorized under R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 and that it provides a benefit, I would not be persuaded by the appellants’\n\nargument that the District was required to pay for its Program through other\n\nrevenue-generating procedures.       According to the appellants, the District should have\n\n\n       13\n         Cyre, founder and owner of Water Resource Associates, has provided consultation for\nhundreds of stormwater utility programs throughout the United States and internationally since the\nearly 1970s.\n       14\n         See the testimony of Earl Leiken, Mayor of Shaker Heights and Bruce Rinker, Mayor of\nMayfield Village.\n\fsought to raise revenues through the procedures outlined in R.C. 6119.17, 6119.18, or\n\n6119.42.\n\n       {¶115} R.C. 6119.17 and 6118.19 require voter approval; but, they each are for a\n\ntax. For the reasons I will discuss below, I would find that the fee here is not a tax.\n\n       {¶116} R.C. 6119.42 governs special assessments and provides in part that:\n\n       [a]ny regional water and sewer district may levy and collect special\n       assessments as provided in Chapter 6119 of the Revised Code. The board of\n       trustees of such district may assess upon abutting, adjacent, contiguous, or\n       other specially benefited lots or lands in the district all or any part of the\n       cost connected with the improvement of any street, alley, or public road or\n       place, or a property or easement of the district by constructing any water\n       resource project or part thereof which the board declares conducive to the\n       public health, safety, convenience, or welfare * * *.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       {¶117} Pursuant to the plain language of the statute, the construction of a water\n\nresource project is incidental to improving “any street, alley, or public road or place, or a\n\nproperty or easement of the district.”      Such is not the circumstance here and R.C.\n\n6119.42 is, therefore, not applicable.\n\n       {¶118} The appellants also contend that the District could have issued water\n\nresource revenue bonds and notes under R.C. 6119.12. The District could have; but it\n\nchose to fund its Program through a fee (“other charge”) imposed under R.C. 6119.09,\n\nand I would find that proper.\n\n       {¶119} Further, I would find untrue the appellants’ contention that, under the\n\nDistrict’s Charter, the only fees the District are allowed to charge are sewer fees.\n\n       {¶120} The Charter specifically provides that\n\f        [a]ny projects not financed through the Ohio Water Development Authority,\n        State of Ohio or Federal Government would be financed in such a manner\n        as may be deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees.\n\nExhibit A to 1975 Charter, at ¶ 5(e)(3).\n\n        {¶121} The District’s Board of Trustees unanimously approved the storm water fee\n\non January 7, 2010, and therefore, I believe the fee is proper under the Charter.\n\n        {¶122} The majority declines to address the application of Drees Co. v. Hamilton\n\nTwp., 132 Ohio St.3d 186, 2012-Ohio-2370, 970 N.E.2d 916, to this case, but I believe it\n\nis instructive. In Drees, the Ohio Supreme Court held that “impact fees” imposed by\n\nHamilton Township, a limited-home-rule township, were a prohibited form of taxation.\n\n        {¶123} The township’s board of trustees passed a resolution that set forth a\n\nschedule of fees to be charged to applicants for zoning certificates for new construction or\n\ndevelopment.    Four categories of fees were included in the resolution: (1) a road-impact\n\nfee; (2) a fire-protection-impact fee; (3) a police-protection-impact fee; and (4) a\n\npark-impact fee.   The purpose of the resolution was set forth as follows:\n\n        The purpose of the impact fee is to benefit the property by providing the\n        Township with adequate funds to provide the same level of service to that\n        property that the Township currently affords previously developed\n        properties.\n\n        The Resolution assesses an impact fee to previously undeveloped property,\n        and property undergoing redevelopment, to offset increased services and\n        improvements because of the development.\n\nId. at ¶ 3.\n\n        {¶124} The amount of the fees varied based on the land use.      The fees collected\n\nwere to be deposited in impact fee accounts, rather than into a general fund.   Each of the\n\ffour types of fees had its own account, and the funds in each of the four accounts were to\n\nbe used only for the purpose of its accompanying category.\n\n       {¶125} The trial court and the Twelfth Appellate District upheld the imposition of\n\nthe fees, finding, among other things, that they were not a prohibited form of taxation.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court disagreed, however.\n\n       {¶126} The court relied on its analysis in State ex rel. Petroleum Underground\n\nStorage Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Withrow, 62 Ohio St.3d 111, 579 N.E.2d 705 (1991),\n\nin determining whether the impact fees were a fee as opposed to a tax.        At issue in\n\nWithrow were assessments imposed by the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Release\n\nCompensation Board on owners and operators of underground storage tanks.              The\n\nassessments helped fund the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financial Assurance\n\nFund, whose purpose was to reimburse the owners and operators of the tanks for the costs\n\nof corrective actions taken when petroleum was released into the environment, and to\n\ncompensate third parties for bodily injury or property damage, or both, resulting from\n\nsuch a release.   The proceeds from the assessments were segregated from the general\n\nfund of the state treasury.\n\n       {¶127} The Ohio Supreme Court cited four reasons for finding that the\n\nassessments in Withrow were a fee rather than a tax.      First, the court noted that the\n\nassessments were imposed to advance regulatory measures that addressed the\n\nenvironmental problems caused by the leaking underground storage tanks. Pursuant to\n\nstatutory regulations, owners and operators of underground storage tanks were strictly\n\fliable to take corrective measures when leaks occurred and to pay damages for the leaks.\n\nThe fund into which the fees were paid ensured that owners and operators could meet\n\nthose statutory requirements.\n\n         {¶128} Next, the court noted that the assessments were not placed in the general\n\nfund and were to be used only for “‘narrow and specific purposes, all directly related to\n\n[underground storage tank] problems.’” Drees at ¶ 18, quoting Withrow at 116-117.\n\n         {¶129} Third, the court stated that a “‘fee is a charge imposed by a government in\n\nreturn for a service it provides.’” Drees at ¶ 19, quoting Withrow at 117. In Withrow,\n\nthe fund into which the fees were paid “operated essentially, as insurance coverage for\n\ncatastrophic damage caused by leaking tanks.” Drees at ¶ 23.\n\n         {¶130} And fourth, the court was “persuaded by the fact that when the unobligated\n\nbalance in the fund exceeded a certain amount, there would be no assessment for that\n\nyear.”    Drees at ¶ 20.    Likewise, if the fund “dipped below a certain amount, the\n\nassessing authority was permitted to charge a supplemental assessment.” Id.        In light\n\nof this, the court noted that the “‘assessment appears to function more as a fee than as a\n\ntax, because a specific charge in return for a service is involved.’” Drees at id., quoting\n\nWithrow at id.\n\n         {¶131} Applying Withrow to the facts in Drees, the court found that the township’s\n\nassessments were taxes. The court first noted that the assessments the township imposed\n\nwere not in “furtherance of statutes designed to protect the public from harms associated\n\nwith a specific industry,” as compared to the fee imposed in Withrow.    Drees at ¶ 21.\n\f       {¶132} Second, the court noted that although the funds collected by the township\n\nwere segregated and not placed into the general fund, the funds were “spent on typical\n\ntownship expenses inuring to the benefit of the entire community.” Id. at ¶ 22.\n\n       {¶133} Next noted by the court was that the fee imposed by the township did not\n\nprovide the assessed party any “particular service above that provided to any other\n\ntaxpayer * * *.” Id. at ¶ 23. In other words, as taxpayers and residents of the township,\n\nthe assessed parties were entitled to police and fire protection and use of the township’s\n\nparks and roadways: “targets of the assessment receive no greater benefit than any other\n\ntaxpayer despite the payment of the additional assessment.” Id.\n\n       {¶134} In regard to the fourth and final Withrow factor, the court in Drees found\n\nthat the spending of the funds collected through the township’s assessment was based on\n\nthe “whims of government,” as opposed to the assessment in Withrow, which was “tied to\n\nevents.”    Id. at ¶ 24.\n\n       {¶135} Considering this case in light of Withrow and Drees, I would find that the\n\ncharge here is more like the assessment in Withrow, that the Ohio Supreme Court held\n\nwas a fee and not a tax.\n\n       {¶136} First, the fee is being imposed by the District to advance regulatory\n\nmeasures. Specifically, the purpose of Title V is to “establish the Regional Stormwater\n\nManagement Program through which the District and each Member Community served\n\nby the Regional Stormwater Management Program shall work in a cooperative manner to\n\naddress stormwater management problems.” Title V at Section 5.0303.\n\f         {¶137} A regional sewer district is an\n\n         independent political subdivision created under R. C. Chapter 6119, and * *\n         * everything related to it is governed by R. C. Chapter 6119. This includes\n         its formation and operation. The cities, counties, townships and the courts\n         are bound by the provisions of R. C. Chapter 6119, and both the formation\n         of the district and its operation must be conducted within the confines of R.\n         C. [C]hapter 6119.\n\nKucinich v. Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., 64 Ohio App.2d 6, 15-16, 410 N.E.2d 795\n\n(8th Dist.1979).\n\n         {¶138} Thus, Title V is regulatory in nature because it is “designed to address\n\nstormwater problems,” aligned with the purpose of providing for the “collection,\n\ntreatment, and disposal of waste water” under R.C. 6119.01(B).\n\n         {¶139} The second Withrow factor suggesting that the charge is truly a fee rather\n\nthan a tax is present here.   That is, the funds generated from the fees will be maintained\n\nin a separate account “dedicated to the implementation and administration of the Regional\n\nStormwater Program * * *.” Title V at Section 5.0701.\n\n         {¶140} Third, the charge imposed by the District is in return for the specific\n\nservice of managing stormwater runoff, which suggests that it is a fee rather than a tax.\n\nAnd fourth, the final Withrow factor suggests that the District’s charge is a fee rather than\n\na tax.   Specifically, the charge is based on the increased demand for stormwater services,\n\nand the fee that each property owner is required to pay under Title V is in return for the\n\nspecific service of managing the stormwater runoff.\n\n         {¶141} In light of the above, I would hold that the charge imposed by the District\n\nis not a tax, but rather, a permissible “other charge” under R.C. 6119.09.\n\f                        III. Title V and Constitutional Provisions\n\n       {¶142} Because the majority sustains the appellants’ first, second, and third\n\nassignments of error, it does not address the constitutional challenges raised by\n\nappellants.   Because I disagree with the majority, I would review their constitutional\n\nchallenges and find them to be without merit for the reasons briefly discussed below.\n\nA. Equal Protection\n\n       {¶143} The appellants contend that Title V violates the Equal Protection Clauses\n\nof the United States and Ohio Constitutions because it treats similarly-situated persons\n\ndifferently in that it: (1) is imposed only on property owners within the District’s sanitary\n\nservice area, as opposed to all property owners within the District’s county-wide\n\nauthority; (2) treats residential and non-residential property owners differently without a\n\nrational basis for doing so; (3) discriminates against small lot owners; (4) ignores the\n\nimpact of stormwater runoff from non-impervious surfaces; (5) exempts certain properties\n\nwithout a rational basis; (6) offers credits without a rational basis; and (7) discriminates\n\nagainst some property owners who, for “remedial work benefitting the general public and\n\nothers who do not pay,” will be forced to “pay to fix runoff problems others create.”\n\n       {¶144} “[A] statute that does not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect\n\nclassification does not violate equal-protection principles if it is rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate government interest.”       State v. Williams, 126 Ohio St.3d 65, 2010-\n\nOhio-2453, 930 N.E.2d 770, ¶ 39, citing Eppley v. Tri-Valley Loc. School Dist. Bd. of\n\nEdn., 122 Ohio St.3d 56, 2009-Ohio-1970, 908 N.E.2d 401, ¶ 15. Here, neither a\n\ffundamental right nor a suspect classification are implicated; therefore, review of Title V\n\nshould determine whether it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\n       {¶145} “Ohio courts grant substantial deference to the legislature when conducting\n\nan equal-protection rational-basis review.” Williams, supra at ¶ 40,         citing State v.\n\nWilliams, 88 Ohio St.3d 513, 531, 2000-Ohio-428, 728 N.E.2d 342.\n\n Application only to Property Owners in District’s Sanitary Service Area\n\n       {¶146} The appellants first contend that the Program violates equal protection\n\nsafeguards because, although the “original Charter gave the Sewer District authority\n\nthroughout Cuyahoga County,” the current Program “applies only to properties within the\n\nDistrict’s Service Area.”\n\n       {¶147} Specifically, the appellants contend that “multiple arbitrary classifications\n\namong Sewer District properties” will be created because Cuyahoga County property\n\nowners in the non-member communities and excluded portions of member communities\n\nwill not be required to pay the fee, while some property owners in member communities\n\nwill be required to pay the fee, despite all the property owners being located in the same\n\nwatersheds in the same county.\n\n       {¶148} The District’s authority is limited to its member communities, who\n\nvoluntarily joined the District in whole or part. Thus, I would find the appellants’\n\nargument is without merit.\n\fResidential vs. Non-Residential Property Owners\n\n       {¶149} The appellants contend that the District’s formulas for charging residential\n\nand non-residential properties “reveals their arbitrary, discriminatory effects.”     The trial\n\ncourt agreed, and ordered an adjustment.       That adjustment is the part of the District’s\n\ncross-appeal and will be addressed in my discussion there.\n\nSmall Lot Owners\n\n       {¶150} The appellants also contend that the District’s fee schedule discriminates\n\nagainst small lot owners. They rely on the testimony of Michael Clar, their expert\n\nwitness, who testified that the fee for small lot owners is inequitable because larger lots\n\nwill produce proportionately more runoff-water than is accounted for in the District’s\n\nformulary.    The District presented the testimony of Hector Cyre, Andrew Reese, and\n\nFrancis Greenland, however, that I would find demonstrated a rational basis for the\n\ndifference.\n\n       {¶151} For example, Reese, a hydrologist who has worked primarily in the area of\n\nmunicipal stormwater engineering, testified that, in addition to being the most common\n\nway for a district to calculate the fee, the District considered the particular situation of the\n\nmember communities and used the system it found most “equitable” and “accurate.”\n\nReese testified that other options were considered along with the impervious surface\n\nmethod, but based on the District’s particular situation, the District concluded that the\n\nimpervious surface measurement method would most fairly distribute the costs.\n\nExemptions\n\f       {¶152} Further, based on testimony of some of the District’s witnesses, I would\n\nfind a rational basis existed for the exemptions, which are for the following properties:\n\npublic road rights-of-way; airport runways and taxiways; railroad rights-of-way; parcels\n\nwith less than 400 square feet of impervious surface; and “[p]arcels whose use has been\n\ndesignated as a Non-Self Supporting Municipal Functions owned by Member\n\nCommunities.”\n\n       {¶153} Greenland, the director of watershed programs for the District, testified\n\nthat public roads are exempt from the Program because they function as part of the storm\n\ndrainage system, and are highly engineered and designed to deal with drainage issues and\n\nthe proper conveyance of stormwater.       Greenland also testified that public roadways,\n\nunlike private ones, are routinely maintained by local governments through allocation of\n\npublic funds, thus, the reason for their exemption.\n\n       {¶154} Further Cyre, founder and owner of Water Resource Associates,        testified\n\nabout the tendency to exempt public roads.      According to Cyre, public roads are often\n\nexempt because the municipality has been the “primary installer of the stormwater\n\ninfrastructure,” and has “borne a large proportion of the capital cost of putting storm\n\nsewers and inlets and catch basins in.”   Moreover, the street surface itself is sometimes a\n\ncomponent of the stormwater system.\n\n       {¶155} Cyre also testified about the exemption for airport runways and taxiways.\n\nAccording to Cyre, “airports are among the most controlled sites around,” meaning that\n\nthey have runway areas, ramps, tarmacs, fueling stations, and de-icing pads, all of which\n\f“get stormwater off of the surfaces and into a control facility” such as a detention facility\n\nor wetland.\n\n       {¶156} Greenland testified about the exemption for railroad rights-of-way as\n\nfollows: “[r]ailroad rights-of-way essentially are large linear ribbons, with highly\n\nengineered ballasts.     Any railroad is designed to really mimic an impervious surface.             It\n\ngets the water up and out really, in their linear, ribbon-like nature.”\n\n       {¶157} Greenland further testified about the exemption for “non-self-supporting\n\nmunicipal functions.” 15      Greenland explained that the exemption was based on the\n\nexemption in the court order establishing the District.16 Further, the exemption was a\n\ncost-cutting measure for the municipalities.\n\n       {¶158} In regard to the exemption for parcels with less than 400 square feet of\n\nimpervious surface, Greenland testified that the District chose that cut-off because many\n\nof those properties did not even show on the aerial photographs, which is how the\n\nimpervious surface measurements are taken.\n\n\n       15\n          “Non-self-supporting municipal functions” are defined as “[m]unicipal functions of Member\nCommunities that are exempt from sewage charges as provided for in the judicial orders establishing\nthe District. This exemption applies to municipal buildings which can be shown to house functions\nthat are not proprietary in nature, including city halls, police and fire departments, service garages,\nand recreational facilities such as parks, playgrounds, indoor recreational facilities, swimming pools,\nand ice rinks.” Title V, Section 5.0214.\n       16\n          The original court order establishing the District provided: “All non-self supporting\nmunicipal functions of the City of Cleveland shall continue to receive sewage service free of charge\nand the Board of Trustees shall afford the same treatment to similar non-self supporting municipal\nfunctions of the suburban municipalities as soon as possible after it commences operation of the\nsystem.”\n\fStormwater Runoff from Non-Impervious Surfaces\n\n       {¶159} According to the appellants, the District’s program is also unconstitutional\n\nbecause it “ignores the significant stormwater runoff impact from non-impervious\n\nsurfaces.”    The District presented testimony demonstrating why impervious surfaces are\n\nused. Through that testimony, it was explained that because the regional system consists\n\nmostly of natural watercourses, it was more fair and equitable to use impervious surfaces\n\nto calculate the fee.   Prior to arriving at that determination, other funding mechanisms\n\nwere evaluated.    But it was determined that basing the fee solely on impervious surfaces\n\nwould be the most equitable way to apportion the costs of the Program. I would hold\n\nthat the District’s determination was constitutionally sound and proper under both R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 and the District’s Charter.\n\nStormwater Education Credit\n\n       {¶160} The appellants contend that the stormwater education credit “lacks all trace\n\nof a connection to either the school’s runoff impacts or to the Sewer District’s purported *\n\n* * goals.”     I disagree.   The credit was designed to educate youth about utilizing\n\nstormwater management practices, such as the use of rain barrels or rain gardens.     With\n\neducation about these practices, the District hopes that future demand on the stormwater\n\nsystem will be reduced, which is in line with the District’s goals.\n\fB. Substantive Due Process\n\n       {¶161} As with the equal protection review, the appellants’ claims of substantive\n\ndue process violations is under a rational basis standard because neither a fundamental\n\nright nor suspect classification is implicated.     Akron v. Rasdan, 105 Ohio App.3d\n\n164,172-173, 663 N.E.2d 947 (9th Dist.1995).\n\n       {¶162} The crux of the appellants’ claim of due process violation is that the fees\n\nare not equitable and the “impervious surface calculation method” is arbitrary and\n\nunreasonable.   I will discuss the extent to which the fees differ between residential and\n\nnon-residential property owners in addressing the District’s cross-appeal.     On all other\n\ngrounds, for the reason discussed herein, I would find the appellants’ claim of due\n\nprocess violation meritless.\n\nC. Home Rule Amendment and Utility Power\n\n       {¶163} Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution is commonly referred to\n\nas the Home Rule Amendment, and authorizes municipalities\n\n       to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce\n       within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations,\n       as are not in conflict with general laws.\n\n       {¶164} Article XVIII, Section 4, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities\n\nutility power as follows:\n\n       [a]ny municipality may acquire, construct, own, lease and operate within or\n       without its corporate limits, any public utility the product or service of\n       which is or is to be supplied to the municipality or its inhabitants, and may\n       contract with others for any such product or service.\n\f       {¶165} The appellants contend that Title V violates the Home Rule Amendment\n\nand its right to power over their utilities. I disagree.\n\n       {¶166} Of significant importance to my resolution of these issues is the fact that\n\nthe District’s member communities voluntarily joined the District. See Seven Hills v.\n\nCleveland, 1 Ohio App.3d 84, 90, 439 N.E.2d 895 (8th Dist.1980) (stating that R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 “must necessarily be construed as not contemplating involuntary\n\ninclusion.”). In joining the District, the communities agreed that the District “shall have\n\nregulatory authority over all local sewerage collection facilities and systems in the\n\nDistrict, including both storm and sanitary sewer systems.”                  Title V, ¶ 5(m)(1).\n\nMoreover, under Title V, the District seeks collaboration with its member communities.17\n\n From my view, the District does not seek to manage stormwater runoff in a vacuum.\n\nAnd, in fact, many of the 56 member communities did collaborate with the District in\n\ndeveloping the Program under Title V, and only 11 member communities are appealing.\n\nThe remaining 80% of the member communities have voiced no objection to the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\n       17\n           See, e.g., Title V, Section 5.0502, stating that the District’s “services, programs, and\ninitiatives shall be supportive of District and Member Community goals and objectives * * *”; Section\n5.0504, stating that the District “shall establish Watershed Advisory Committees,” the rules, policies\nand procedures for which “shall be available for Member Community review and comment”; Section\n5.0504(b), stating that the Watershed Advisory Committee “shall * * * [a]ssist the District in\ndetermining Regional Stormwater Management Program activities and priorities in each watershed.\nThe recommendations of Watershed Advisory Committees shall be considered during the preparation\nof each Stormwater Master Plan”; Section 5.0506, providing that construction projects “shall involve\nMember Community and Watershed Advisory input”; and Section 5.0508, requiring that member\ncommunities provide the district with plans for any stormwater management project and requiring that\nthe District will review the plans and “provide and review comments * * *.”\n\f       {¶167} By way of example of the District’s collaboration with the member\n\ncommunities, and their response, in a chart summarizing “Round 1 Meetings” with city\n\nofficials from the member communities, the support was overwhelmingly in favor of the\n\nDistrict managing stormwater runoff issues, including support from some of the appealing\n\ncommunities. Under the comments from a February 2008 meeting with officials from\n\none of the appealing communities, Bedford Heights, it was noted that the city was\n\n“[s]upportive, see[s] the need” and from an October 2007 meeting with officials from\n\nBrecksville, it was noted “[s]upportive.       They see District can help them work with their\n\nneighboring communities, and with [the] Turnpike Commission.”18\n\n       {¶168} Moreover, Section 5.0107 of            Title V provides: “[n]othing in this Title\n\nshall be construed to infringe upon or supplant a Member Community’s, or other local\n\ngovernment’s, power and responsibility, however derived, to plan, finance, construct,\n\nmaintain, operate, and regulate the Local Stormwater System within their jurisdiction.”\n\n       {¶169} In light of the above, I would overrule the fourth assignment of error.\n\n                               IV.   The District’s Cross-Appeal\n\n      {¶170} I agree with the majority that an appeal from a judgment with which the\n\nappellant has voluntarily complied generally renders the appeal moot. Sunkin v. Collision\n\n       18\n          To be fair, the same chart noted that some of the appealing communities were opposed.\nFor example, under the comments from a January 2008 meeting with Lyndhurst officials, it was\nnoted: “We don’t need this. No flooding problems except golf course, and we don’t really care\nabout them. You’re 5 years too late.” From a January 2008 meeting with Strongsville officials, it\nwas noted, “[w]e’ll be glad to help out in your ‘study’ but don’t even think about charging a fee. It\nwill drive commercial owners out of our city. We rely on them for taxes, and we’re competing\nagainst Medina County.”\n\fPro, Inc., 174 Ohio App.3d 56, 65-66, 2007-Ohio-6046, 880 N.E.2d 947 (9th Dist.), citing\n\nAm. Book Co. v. Kansas, 193 U.S. 49, 52, 24 S.Ct. 394, 48 L.Ed. 613 (1904). But I do\n\nnot share the majority’s concern about the trial court “overstepping” its boundaries to\n\n“draft legislative measures.”\n\n       {¶171} As noted by the majority, the required process for implementing such a\n\nprogram as the one at issue here was for the District to file a petition with the common\n\npleas court for amendment or modification of the plan of operation that originally created\n\nthe District. See R.C. 6119.051. The District followed the process by filing this action.\n\n  The trial court could accept the District’s Program so long as the amendment or\n\nmodification is in keeping with the purposes of R.C. 6119.01. Id.\n\n       {¶172} I believe, subject to the standard below, that after hearing and reviewing\n\nthe voluminous testimony and exhibits presented during the bench trial, the trial court was\n\nwithin its authority to make amendments or modifications to the District’s Program that\n\nwere in line with the purposes of R.C. Chapter 6119.19\n\n       {¶173} I would review the trial court’s modifications, therefore, like I would\n\nreview any trial court judgment in a civil case; that is, to determine whether it is against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence. KeyBank Natl. Assn. v. Mazer Corp., 188 Ohio\n\nApp.3d 278, 2010-Ohio-1508, 935 N.E.2d 428, ¶ 36 (2d Dist.). In the civil context, a\n\njudgment will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight\n\n        19\n           See Cleveland v. N.E. Ohio Regional Sewer Dist., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 55709, 1989\n Ohio App. LEXIS 3589 at * 10-*11 (Sept. 14, 1989), seeming to imply that a trial court does have\n authority under R.C. 6119.051 to make amendments or modifications of a sewer district’s plan.\n\fof the evidence if there is some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential\n\nelements of the case. C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co., 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 376\n\nN.E.2d 578 (1978), syllabus.\n\nDisparate Treatment of Residential and Non-Residential Property Owners\n\n       {¶174} In its first assignment of error, the District contends that the trial court\n\nerred in finding that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between residential\n\nproperty owners and non-residential property owners.     I disagree.\n\n       {¶175} The District calculated the stormwater fee for each property using an\n\n“equivalent residential unit.”   Each unit represents 3,000 square feet of impervious\n\nsurface.   Under the District’s initial plan, non-residential property owners were to be\n\ncharged in multiples of the “equivalent residential unit,” while residential property\n\nowners’ “equivalent residential units” were established in three tiers.\n\n       {¶176} The District describes the fee as being based on “all impervious surfaces\n\nwithin the District’s service area * * *” (Title V, Section 5.0223) “based on the\n\nincremental increase in the demand on the Regional Stormwater System caused by\n\ndevelopment on parcels of land.” (District’s Answer Brief, p. 11).\n\n       {¶177} I agree with the trial court that there was no rational basis for charging\n\nnonresidential property owners based on the exact amount of impervious surfaces on their\n\nproperty, while fluctuating the charge for residential property owners.   The “incremental\n\nincrease in demand” is not affected by whether the property owner uses the property for\n\fresidential or commercial purposes and, thus, there was no rational basis for treating the\n\ntwo groups differently.\n\n       {¶178} In light of the above, I would overrule the first assignment of error.\n\nStormwater Education Credit\n\n       {¶179} Under Title V, schools within the District that provide “approved\n\nstormwater pollution prevent curricula to their students that meet and maintain at least the\n\nminimum requirements of the Stormwater Fee Credit Policy Manual may receive a\n\nStormwater Fee Credit * * *.”    (Italics added; underscore sic.) Id. at Section 5.0804(c).\n\n       {¶180} The trial court found that the credit was a “rational way to advance a\n\nlegitimate governmental interest,” but required the District to provide the curriculum.\n\nThe District contends in its second assignment of error that the trial court had no legal\n\nbasis for such an order.    In light of the fact that the credit may only be earned by\n\nproviding approved curricula that are compliant with the District’s policy manual, I would\n\nfind that the court’s order was legally sound.\n\n       {¶181} I would overrule the District’s second assignment of error.\n\nAccrediting Costs for Licensed Engineers\n\n       {¶182} For its third assignment of error, the District contends that the trial court\n\nhad no legal basis for requiring it to come up with a formula for accrediting the costs of\n\nlicensed engineers for completing any applications for credit.   According to the District,\n\n“reimbursing engineering costs was not factored into the District’s plan for the Program\n\nand projected revenue requirements.”\n\f       {¶183} I would find the trial court acted legally in requiring the accreditation, and\n\nlimited it so that it would not be a financial burden to the District and thus\n\ncounterproductive to its Program.     Specifically, the trial court ordered that an engineer’s\n\ncredit cannot exceed 10 percent of the stormwater fee and the credit will only be available\n\nto nonresidential property owners, including school districts.\n\nIncrease in the Community Cost Share\n\n       {¶184} Under the “Community Cost-Share Program” in Title V, the District “shall\n\nform a financial account * * * that shall be for the aggregation and dissemination of funds\n\nderived from revenues collected from the Stormwater Fee and whose purpose is to\n\nprovide funding to assist in Member-Community-requested and District-approved\n\nprojects.”   Title V, Section 5.0901.     The title initially required that at least 7.5 percent\n\nof the “total annual revenue collected in each Member Community shall be allocated to\n\nthat Member Community * * *.” Id. at Section 5.0903(a).\n\n       {¶185} In its February 2012 opinion, the trial court found that because “as much of\n\n78 percent of the watershed may be outside of District control,” the minimum 7.5 percent\n\ncost share was “unfair to member communities because many flooding problems are in\n\nareas that drain far less than 300 acres,20 and the communities are in need of additional\n\nfunds to deal with these local stormwater issues.”     The trial court ordered that\n\n\n\n\n         “Regional Stormwater System” is defined under Title V, in part, to include “watercourses,\n        20\n\nstormwater conveyance structures, and stormwater control measures receiving drainage from three\nhundred (300) acres of land or more.” Id. at Section 5.9218.\n\f       [e]ither the meaning of ‘regional’ must be arrived at by means of a\n       consensus of the District and its member communities or cost share must\n       reflect an amount no less than 25 percent to member communities for local\n       stormwater projects.\n\n       {¶186} I would find that the trial court’s increase was legally sound. Sufficient\n\nevidence was presented demonstrating that the District’s original 7.5 percent cost share\n\nwas inadequate to address the problems that the District hopes to solve.\n\n                                      V. Conclusion\n\n       {¶187} I believe Title V was authorized under both the District’s Charter and Ohio\n\nLaw.   As such, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision to the contrary.\n\nFurther, I also believe the trial court acted legally in making modifications to the Title.\n\nAs such, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s “concerns” in that regard.\n\n       {¶188} I concur with the majority’s judgment affirming the denial of appellants’\n\nmotion to dismiss based on failure to join all property owners. I also concur with the\n\nmajority’s judgment affirming the trial court’s jurisdiction to make post-trial\n\namendments.\n\n       {¶189} In light of the above, I would overrule all the assignments of errors\n\npresented in both the appellants’ appeal and the appellees’ cross-appeal and affirm the\n\ntrial court’s judgments in toto.\n\f",

Chapter 6119, the Sewer District was officially organized and declared a\n\npolitical subdivision of the state of Ohio.4 The necessity for the Sewer District arose\n\nfrom “the increase in the amount of wastewater in the Metropolitan Cleveland area\n\nresulting from the increase in population and the expansion of industry * * *.” Exhibit\n\nA, ¶ 3, 1972 Judgment.\n\n       {¶6} The Sewer District was formed for “the establishment of a total waste water\n\ncontrol system for the collection, treatment and disposal of waste water within and\n\nwithout the District.” Id. at ¶ 4.      To effectuate that purpose, the Sewer District was\n\ncharged with, among other things, planning, financing, constructing, operating, and\n\ncontrolling “waste water treatment and disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all\n\nsewer regulator systems and devices, weirs, retaining basins, storm handling facilities,\n\nand all other water pollution control facilities of the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(c).\n\n       {¶7} The Sewer District’s initial plan of operation was amended by various\n\npetitions and court orders, culminating in a 1975 court order that constitutes the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s Charter (“Charter”).5 Under the Charter, the Sewer District\n\n       shall have authority pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised Code to\n       plan, finance, construct, maintain, operate, and regulate local sewerage\n\n\n       4\n        The Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District was originally named the Cleveland Regional\nSewer District; its name was changed by court order to its current name in 1979.\n       5\n          Although the Charter has been amended by other court orders, the core of it remains and\ngoverns this case.\n\f       collection facilities and systems within the District, including both storm\n       and sanitary sewer systems.\n\nExhibit A, ¶ 5(m), 1975 Judgment.\n\n       {¶8} Exhibit A to the Charter recognizes the territory to be included in the Sewer\n\nDistrict was to include “that portion of Cuyahoga County presently served, or mainly\n\ncapable of being served by gravity, by sewers leading to the three wastewater treatment\n\nplants in the City of Cleveland plus the proposed Cuyahoga Valley Interceptor Sewer.”\n\nSewer District membership arose based upon the consenting member communities’ need\n\nto connect to and use those facilities.     The member communities include some from\n\nCuyahoga, Summit, Lorain, and Lake Counties.\n\n       {¶9} Under the Charter, the plan for operation of the Sewer District entails the\n\nconstruction, operation, and financing of District and local facilities.\n\n       The District will plan, finance, construct, operate and control wastewater\n       treatment and disposal facilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer\n       regulator systems and devices, weirs, retaining basins, storm water handling\n       facilities, and all other water pollution control facilities of the District * *\n       *.”\n\nExhibit A, ¶ 5(c), 1975 Judgment. The Charter provides the Sewer District’s Board of\n\nTrustees with authority to determine rates for sewage treatment and disposal in\n\naccordance with its terms. Id. at ¶ 5(f).\n\n       {¶10} With regard to local sewerage collection facilities, the Charter provides:\n\n       The District shall not assume ownership of any local sewerage collection\n       facilities and systems nor shall the District assume responsibility or incur\n       any liability for the planning, financing, construction, operation,\n       maintenance, or repair of any local sewerage collection facilities and\n\f       systems unless * * * specifically provided for in a written agreement\n       between the District and the respective local community.\n\nId. at ¶ 5(m).\n\n       {¶11}     The Charter provides the Sewer District with regulatory authority over “all\n\nlocal sewerage collections facilities and systems in the District, including both storm and\n\nsanitary sewer systems.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(1).       However, the Sewer District only has the\n\nauthority to “assume the responsibility for operating, maintaining, and repairing local\n\nsewerage collection facilities when requested to do so by a local community and upon\n\nmutually agreeable terms.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(2).       Likewise, the District is only authorized\n\nto construct local sewerage collection facilities and systems “when requested to do so by a\n\nlocal community and upon mutually agreeable terms.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(4).        With regard to\n\nplanning local sewerage collection facilities and systems, the Charter further charged the\n\nSewer District with developing a capital improvement plan:\n\n       The District shall develop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan\n       for regional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage\n       designed to identify a capital improvement program for the solution of all\n       inter-community drainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the\n       District.\n\nId. at ¶ 5(m)(3).\n\n       {¶12} For financing local sewerage collection facilities and systems, “[t]he method\n\nof financing particular projects shall be agreed to between the District and the respective\n\nlocal communities at the time the project is undertaken by the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(5).\n\n                                         III.   Facts\n\f       {¶13} In January 2010, the Sewer District’s Board of Trustees amended the\n\nDistrict’s Code of Regulations by enacting Title V, “Stormwater Management Code,”\n\nwhich created a “Regional Stormwater Management Program” (“the RSM Program”).\n\nUnder Title V, the Board defined the scope of its RSM Program, which included\n\n“planning, financing, design, improvement, construction, inspection, monitoring,\n\nmaintenance, operation and regulation” of its own defined “Regional Stormwater\n\nSystem.” Title V, Section 5.0501. The definition of “Regional Stormwater System” is\n\nexpansively written to include the following:\n\n       The entire system of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and\n       Stormwater Control Measures in the Sewer District’s service area that are\n       owned and/or operated by the Sewer District or over which the Sewer\n       District has right of use for the management of stormwater, including both\n       naturally occurring and constructed facilities. The Regional Stormwater\n       System shall generally include those watercourses, stormwater conveyance\n       structures, and Stormwater Control Measures receiving drainage from three\n       hundred (300) acres of land or more. The Sewer District shall maintain a\n       map of the Regional Stormwater System that shall serve as the official\n       delineation of such system.\n\nId. at Section 5.0218.\n\n       {¶14} The stated purpose of Title V is to “establish the Regional Stormwater\n\nManagement Program through which the District and each Member Community served\n\nby the Regional Stormwater Management Program shall work in a cooperative manner to\n\naddress stormwater management problems.” Id. at Section 5.0303. In broad terms, the\n\nRSM Program consists of the following:\n\n       All activities necessary to operate, maintain, improve, administer, and\n       provide Stormwater Management of the Regional Stormwater System and\n\f       to facilitate and integrate activities that benefit and improve watershed\n       conditions across the Sewer District’s service area.\n\nId. at Section 5.0219.\n\n       {¶15} As stated in Title V, the RSM Program was needed because\n\n       (a) Flooding is a significant threat to public and private property.\n\n       (b) Streambank erosion is a significant threat to public and private property,\n       water quality, wildlife, and aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\n       (c) Inadequate stormwater management damages the water resources of\n       Northeast Ohio, impairing the ability of these waters to sustain ecological\n       and aquatic systems.\n\n       (d) A watershed-based approach to stormwater management is necessary to\n       effectively and efficiently plan, design, construct, and maintain long-term\n       solutions to stormwater problems.\n\n       (e) An adequate funding source is necessary to provide a watershed-based\n       approach to stormwater management.\n\n       (f) Impervious surface on a given parcel relates to the volume, rate, and/or\n       pollutant loading of stormwater runoff discharged from that parcel.\n\n       (g) The measurement of impervious surface that causes stormwater runoff\n       provides an equitable and adequate basis for a system of fees for funding a\n       watershed-based approach to stormwater management.\n\nId. at Section 5.0301.\n\n       {¶16} The Sewer District intends to fund projects under the RSM Program through\n\nthe imposition of a stormwater fee.    The fee is based on the square feet of a property’s\n\nimpervious surfaces, which are defined in Title V as follows:\n\n       Developed surfaces that either prevent or significantly slow the infiltration\n       of water into the ground compared to the manner that such water entered\n       the ground prior to development, or which cause water to run off in greater\n       quantities or at an increased rate of flow than that present prior to\n       development. Impervious surfaces shall include, without limitation,\n\f       rooftops, traveled gravel areas, asphalt or concrete paved areas, private\n       access roads, driveways and parking lots, and patio areas.\n\nId. at Section 5.0210.\n\n       {¶17} “Based on analysis by the District of impervious surfaces on parcels\n\nthroughout the District’s service area, an impervious surface of three thousand (3,000)\n\nsquare feet shall be designated as one (1) Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) * * *.” Id.\n\nat Section 5.0706.\n\n       {¶18} For calculating the fee for residential properties, the Sewer District\n\nstructured a three-tiered scale based on the size of the residential parcel. Id. at Section\n\n5.0707. Residential parcels with less than 2,000 square feet of impervious surface will\n\nbe classified as equal to 0.6 of an ERU and will be charged $3.03 per month in 2013.    Id.\n\n Residential parcels with 2,000 to 3,999 square feet of impervious surface will be\n\nclassified as equal to 1.0 ERU and will be charged $5.05 per month in 2013.      Id. And\n\nresidential parcels with 4,000 or more square feet of impervious surface will be classified\n\nas equal to 1.8 ERUs and charged $9.09 per month in 2013.     Id.\n\n       {¶19} For nonresidential property owners, the Sewer District will individually\n\ndetermine their fees by measuring impervious surfaces on their parcels, and then\n\nmultiplying (1) the total number of ERUs for a given parcel (which will be derived from\n\ncalculating the total square feet of impervious surface divided by 3,000), by (2) the fee\n\nestablished per ERU, which is $5.05 per month in 2013. Id. at Section 5.0708.\n\f       {¶20} Title V requires that the collected fees be maintained in a separate account\n\n“dedicated to the implementation and administration of the Regional Stormwater Program\n\n* * *.” Id. at Section 5.0701.\n\n       {¶21} Title V exempts certain properties from the fees:                        public road\n\nrights-of-way; airport runways and taxiways; railroad rights-of-way; parcels with less\n\nthan 400 square feet of impervious surface; and “[p]arcels whose use has been designated\n\nas a Non-Self Supporting Municipal Function owned by Member Communities.” Id. at\n\nSection 5.0705.\n\n       {¶22} Title V also has a “Community Cost-Share Program,” which requires the\n\nSewer District to place a minimum amount of all funds collected from the fees in a\n\nseparate account for each of the 56 member communities to use for District-approved\n\nprojects to “promote or implement the goals and objectives” of Title V within the member\n\ncommunities.6 Id. at Sections 5.0901 and 5.0902.\n\n       {¶23} Credits are a part of Title V, and are available for applicants who maintain\n\nand operate stormwater-control measures.

Credits can be combined for a maximum credit of 100\n\npercent. Id. at Section 5.084.\n\n\n\n       6\n         Title V set the minimum amount of funds that would go into the Community Cost-Share\nProgram’s account at 7.5 percent. However, the trial court ordered the Sewer District to increase the\namount to 25 percent.\n\f                                    IV. Procedural History\n\n       {¶24} In January 2010, on the same day that the District’s Board of Trustees\n\nenacted Title V, the Sewer District filed this action in the trial court seeking (1) a\n\njudgment declaring that the Sewer District had the authority to implement its RSM\n\nProgram with respect to all the member communities served by the District and (2) an\n\norder permitting the Sewer District to amend its Plan for Operation to include Title V.\n\nThe 56 member communities were named as defendants.\n\n       {¶25} The trial court allowed the intervening property owners to join the action;\n\nthey filed an answer and counterclaim.7 The intervening property owners sought, among\n\nother things, to permanently enjoin the Sewer District from implementing its RSM\n\nProgram.    The appealing communities filed an answer and counterclaims, in which they\n\nalso sought, among other things, to permanently enjoin the Sewer District from\n\nimplementing its RSM Program.\n\n       {¶26} In June 2010, the appealing communities filed a motion to dismiss for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction; the intervening property owners joined in the motion. In\n\ntheir motion, they contended, among other things, that the Sewer District could not obtain\n\njudgment because it failed to name as defendants the individual property owners within\n\nthe Sewer District’s service area.\n\n\n       7\n          Other parties were also permitted to intervene in the action. The additional intervenors\nincluded Richard Lennon, Bishop of the Diocese of Cleveland in his capacity of Trustee of an Implied\nCharitable Trust, the Catholic Cemeteries Association of the Diocese of Cleveland, and the Cleveland\nMunicipal School District Board of Education.\n\f         {¶27} The trial court denied the motion, and stated in regard to the failure to join\n\nclaim, that there was no necessity that the Sewer District had to name all the property\n\nowners in the District because they were represented by the public officials of their\n\nrespective communities.\n\n         {¶28} The parties filed motions for summary judgment.          The Sewer District\n\nmoved for partial summary judgment, seeking a determination that, under its Charter and\n\nstatutory authority, it properly enacted Title V.   The appealing communities, intervening\n\nproperty owners, and other defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment on that\n\nissue.    The issue of the validity and implementation of the stormwater fee was reserved\n\nfor trial.\n\n         {¶29} In April 2011, the trial court issued its ruling on the summary judgment\n\nmotions, finding that the Sewer District had the authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 and its\n\nCharter to enact its RSM Program.\n\n         {¶30} In late 2011, a bench trial was had on the issue of the validity and\n\nimplementation of the stormwater fee.         In February 2012, the trial court issued an\n\nopinion in which it found that the stormwater fee (1) was authorized under R.C. Chapter\n\n6119, (2) was not restricted by the Sewer District’s Charter, (3) was not an unauthorized\n\ntax, and (4) did not violate the parties’ equal protection rights.   The court further found\n\nthe methodology used to calculate and impose the fee was constitutional.\n\n         {¶31} But the court found that there was no rational basis for the Sewer District’s\n\ndisparate treatment of nonresidential, as compared to residential, property owners.      The\n\fcourt also found that the 7.5 percent minimum allocation into the Cost-Share Program\n\nwas unfair to the member communities, and that it should be no less than 25 percent.\n\n       {¶32} Moreover, relative to the stormwater education credit, the court ordered that\n\nthe Sewer District “shall provide the school systems with appropriate curriculum for each\n\nof grades 1–12 to achieve the stated purposes of the credit.”       The court also ordered,\n\nrelative to the credits in general, that the Sewer District “shall submit a plan or formula\n\nproviding for the accrediting of costs of a licensed engineer in completing any\n\napplications for credits under the stormwater Fee Credit Manual.”\n\n       {¶33} Post-trial proceedings were had relative to the trial court’s orders.   During\n\nthose proceedings, the Sewer District submitted draft revisions to Title V, to which the\n\nappealing communities and intervening property owners objected. In June 2012, the\n\ntrial court issued a supplemental journal entry, in which it adopted the Sewer District’s\n\nrevisions.\n\n       {¶34} The appellants filed a motion for reconsideration based on the Ohio\n\nSupreme Court’s then-recent ruling in Drees Co. v. Hamilton Twp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n2012-Ohio-2370, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which was issued approximately three months after the\n\ntrial court’s 2012 ruling. The trial court denied the motion.\n\n  V. The Appealing Communities and Intervening Property Owners’ Assignments of\n                                    Error\n\n       {¶35} The appealing communities and intervening property owners have assigned\n\nthe following as errors:\n\fI. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nCounterclaims, to the extent that they sought permanently to enjoin the\nSewer District from imposing and collecting its unlawful “Stormwater Fee.”\n\nII. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nCounterclaims, to the extent that it sought permanently to enjoin the Sewer\nDistrict from undertaking a comprehensive Stormwater Management\nProgram (i.e., its Title V) for which it has no authority under R.C. Chapter\n6119.\n\nIII. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and the Property Owners’\nCounterclaims to the extent that they sought permanently to enjoin the\nSewer District from undertaking an SMP8 not authorized by its Charter.\n\nIV. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nCounterclaims, to the extent that they sought permanently to enjoin the\nSewer District from undertaking its SMP, because that SMP, as applied,\nviolates numerous Ohio and Federal Constitutional provisions.\n\nV. The trial court erred in denying the Cities’ and Property Owners’\nmotion to dismiss because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\ndue to Plaintiff’s failure to join all necessary parties in the action.\nVI. The trial court erred when it oversaw amendments to Title V after\nholding a trial and after its February 2012 Opinion declaring the rights of\nthe parties.\n\n            VI. The Sewer District’s Cross-Assignments of Error\n\n{¶36} In its cross-appeal, the District has assigned the following as errors:\n\nI. The trial court erred in finding that there is no rational basis for\ndisparate treatment of residential and nonresidential property owners with\nrespect to the stormwater fee.\n\nII. The trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to provide\nthe school systems with appropriate curricula for grades 1–12 to further the\nstated purpose of the stormwater education credit set forth in Title V.\n\n\n\n8\n    Stormwater management program.\n\f       III. The trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to accredit\n       costs of licensed engineers in completing nonresidential property owners’\n       applications for credits available under Title V.\n\n       IV. The trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to revise, or\n       to increase the amount of, the community cost-share set forth in Title V.\n\n                                  VII.   Law and Analysis\n\n       A.     The Appellants’ Appeal\n\n      1.     The Stormwater Management Program and the Stormwater\n             Fee Under R.C. Chapter 6119 and the District’s Charter.\n\n      {¶37} Appellants’ first, second, and third assignments of error relate to the\n\nauthority of the Sewer District to implement Title V and the RSM Program, along with its\n\nassociated stormwater fee.\n\n       {¶38} In their first assignment of error, the appellants contend that the stormwater\n\nfee is an unlawful tax.   They further argue that even if it is not an unlawful tax, it is not\n\nauthorized under R.C. 6119.09.      In their second assigned error, the appellants contend\n\nthe Sewer District has no authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 for undertaking a\n\ncomprehensive stormwater management program. In their third assignment of error, the\n\nappellants argue that the RSM Program is not authorized by the Sewer District’s Charter.\n\n       {¶39} Appellate review of summary judgment is de novo, governed by the\n\nstandard set forth in Civ.R. 56.

The Sewer\n\nDistrict does not have the power to extend the authority conferred on it by the General\n\nAssembly. D.A.B.E., Inc. at ¶ 38.\n\n       {¶41} The appellants contend that the Sewer District was “utterly without statutory\n\npower under R.C. Chapter 6119 to enact Title V * * *.”     They cite the following reasons\n\nin support of their contention: (1) the Sewer District had no express authority for its RSM\n\nProgram under R.C. Chapter 6119; (2) the Sewer District’s program is not in keeping\n\nwith the purposes of R.C. Chapter 6119 as set forth in R.C. 6119.01; (3) other agencies\n\nsuch as watershed districts and conservancy districts are charged with dealing with\n\nstormwater-related issues; and (4) the definition of waste water in both R.C. 6119.011\n\nand the Charter demonstrate that the Sewer District’s RSM Program was not authorized.\n\f       {¶42} The first rule of statutory construction requires courts to look at a statute’s\n\nlanguage to determine its meaning.       If the statute conveys a clear, unequivocal, and\n\ndefinite meaning, interpretation comes to an end, and the statute must be applied\n\naccording to its terms.   Lancaster Colony Corp. v. Limbach, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1389</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).\n\n       {¶43} Pursuant to R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B), the purpose of a regional water and\n\nsewer district is for “either or both” of the following purposes:   “(A) [t]o supply water to\n\nusers within and without the district”; and “(B) [t]o provide for the collection, treatment,\n\nand disposal of waste water within and without the district.”       “Waste water” is defined\n\nas “any storm water and any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other\n\npollutants or contaminants derived from the prior use of the water.”      R.C. 6119.011(K).\n\nEssentially, the statutory terms authorize the Sewer District to collect, treat, and dispose\n\nof waste water entering the sewer system.\n\n       {¶44} The term waste water necessarily means water containing waste.           Under\n\nR.C. 6119.011(K), “waste water means” “any storm water containing sewage or other\n\npollutants.”   (Emphasis added.) Reith v.

Indeed, the District’s own “waste\n\nwater” definition in Titles I, II, and IV of its code of regulations recognizes it as a\n\n“combination of water-carried waste * * * together with such ground, surface or storm\n\nwater as may be present.”\n\f       {¶45} The General Assembly created regional sewer districts to “collect, treat, and\n\ndispose” of “waste water.”     Implicit in this express grant of power is that a Sewer\n\nDistrict is charged with removing sewage or other pollutants from storm water as well as\n\nother water containing such waste.     The definition of waste water cannot be read to\n\nauthorize the Sewer District to unilaterally exercise control over a broad range of\n\nstormwater-related issues that are not mentioned under and bear no resemblance to the\n\npowers conferred through R.C. Chapter 6119.\n\n       {¶46} R.C. Chapter 6119 does not authorize the District to implement a\n\n“stormwater management” program to address flooding, erosion, and other stormwater\n\nissues or to claim control over a “Regional Stormwater System.”        Such terms appear\n\nnowhere in R.C. Chapter 6119. Unlike the authority granted to the Sewer District, the\n\nGeneral Assembly gave specific stormwater-related authority to watershed districts and\n\nconservancy districts. See R.C. 6105.12 (providing watershed districts with authority to\n\nreview and recommend plans for the development of the water resources), and R.C.\n\n6101.04 (providing conservancy districts with authority to “prevent floods” and\n\n“regulating stream channels,” “irrigation,” “diverting * * * watercourses,” and “arresting\n\nerosion.”)\n\n       {¶47} In promulgating its RSM Program and in defining its terms, the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s board engaged in policy-making over matters that are legislative in nature.   By\n\nengaging in such actions, the Sewer District has gone beyond administrative rule-making\n\nand usurped power delegated to the General Assembly.\n\f       [T]he board of trustees of a regional water and sewer district may provide a\n       system of sanitary and/or storm water sewerage * * * for any part of the\n       area included within the district.\n\nR.C. 6119.19.\n\n       {¶48} With regard to the challenge to the stormwater fee being an unlawful tax,9\n\nwe are cognizant that other jurisdictions have found stormwater charges are fees.              We\n\nneed not decide whether this is the case under Ohio law.10 Rather, our focus is on\n\nwhether the Sewer District possesses the authority under R.C. Chapter 6119 to implement\n\nits RSM Program and the associated stormwater fee.\n\n       {¶49} The stormwater fee is being imposed by the Sewer District to advance Title\n\nV and address regional stormwater management problems that will serve to benefit the\n\nentire region.   The benefits to the community at large include decreasing flooding,\n\npreventing erosion, collecting sediment and debris, maintenance of various protective and\n\ncontrol structures with a “regional stormwater system.” Other benefits include\n\nimprovements in water quality, habitat for wildlife and reduction of future costs relating\n\nto stormwater management.         The Sewer District ignores the complete lack of any\n\nexpress grant of powers under R.C. Chapter 6119 relating to any of the RSM Program’s\n\nregulatory objects.\n\n\n        9\n          We note that R.C. 6119.17 and 6119.19 authorize the Sewer District to levy a tax for “any\nportion of the cost of one or more water resource projects[.]”\n        10\n           In Drees Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012-Ohio-2370, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Ohio Supreme\nCourt set forth a number of factors for analyzing the substance of an assessment to determine\nwhether it is a fee or a tax.\n\f       {¶50} R.C. 6119.09 provides in part that, “[a] regional water and sewer district\n\nmay charge, alter, and collect rentals or other charges * * * for the use or services of any\n\nwater resource project or any benefit conferred thereby and contract * * * with one or\n\nmore persons * * * desiring the use or services thereof, and fix the terms, conditions,\n\nrental, or other charges * * * for such use or services.”   R.C. 6119.09.\n\n       {¶51} Additionally, R.C. 6119.06 governs the rights, powers, and duties of a\n\nregional water and sewer district, and provides that the district may, in relevant part, do\n\nthe following:\n\n       [a]cquire, construct, reconstruct, enlarge, improve, furnish, equip, maintain,\n       repair, operate, lease or rent to or from, or contract for operation by or for, a\n       political subdivision or person, water resource projects within or without\n       the district\n\nR.C. 6119.06(G);\n\n       [c]harge, alter, and collect rentals and other charges for the use of services\n       of any water resource project as provided in section 6119.09 of the Revised\n       Code. Such district may refuse the services of any of its projects if any of\n       such rental or other charges, including penalties for late payment, are not\n       paid by the user thereof * * *\n\nR.C. 6119.06(W); and\n\n       [d]o all acts necessary or proper to carry out the powers granted in Chapter\n       6119 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 6119.06(BB).\n\n       {¶52} A “water resource project” is defined under R.C. 6119.011(G) as “any waste\n\nwater facility or water management facility acquired, constructed, or operated by or\n\fleased to a regional water and sewer district or to be acquired, constructed, or operated by\n\nor leased to a regional water and sewer district under this chapter * * *.”\n\n       {¶53} In this case, we find the stormwater fee was unrelated to any use or services\n\nafforded to a property owner by a “water resource project.”      This case is wholly unlike\n\nthe tap-in fee charged in Wyatt v. Trimble Twp. Waste Water Treatment Dist., 4th Dist.\n\nAthens No. 1521, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 5749 (Nov. 3, 1992), where the charge was for\n\nthe installation of a plug-in system at the point where each premises was to be connected\n\nto an existing sanitary sewer and waste water treatment project as authorized by R.C.\n\n6119.09(Z), and which project was found necessary to bring the communities into\n\ncompliance with the Clean Water Act (Federal Water Pollution Control Act) (33 U.S.C.\n\n1251 et seq.).\n\n       {¶54} Here, there was no service connection being made from the properties to a\n\nwater resource project.   Further, Kyle Dreyfus Wells, the Sewer District’s manager of\n\nwatershed programs, testified that the stormwater management plan plays no more than\n\nan incidental role in municipal compliance with Clean Water Act regulatory obligations.\n\nTr. 1531-1534.\n\n       {¶55} Finally, while R.C. 6119.06(BB) authorizes the Sewer District to do all acts\n\nnecessary to carry out its authorized powers, the Sewer District cannot exceed the\n\nauthority granted.   While the Sewer District’s authority is broad, we are unable to\n\nconclude that the legislature intended to allow the Sewer District to expand upon its\n\fstatutory authority through Title V and its RSM Program and impose an unauthorized\n\ncharge.\n\n       {¶56} Here, the Sewer District improperly employed R.C. 6119.09 to generate\n\nrevenues for the costs of its RSM Program.     The waste water fee was not for the “use or\n\nservice” of a “water resource project.”    Accordingly, we find that the stormwater fee is\n\nnot a legitimate “rental or other charge” under R.C. 6119.09.\n\n       {¶57} We further recognize that in this case, there was no vetting as to the\n\nallowance for the Sewer District to fund its stormwater management program with a\n\nstormwater fee.   By implementing the stormwater fee, the Sewer District has effectively\n\ntaken upon itself to claim a share of community dollars, while other public entities such\n\nas school districts must continue their struggle to obtain public funding.\n\n       {¶58} We find that the General Assembly has not indicated any intent through\n\nR.C. Chapter 6119 to vest regional water and sewer districts with the authority to adopt a\n\nstormwater management program or to implement the stormwater control measures set\n\nforth in Title V. The General Assembly did not intend to permit the Sewer District to\n\nexpound upon its own powers without any oversight, proclaim the scope and breadth of\n\nits authority over stormwater management issues, and impose an associated stormwater\n\nfee.   There is no doubt that with the increased development in the region over the last\n\nseveral decades, regulations are needed over the stormwater-related issues that plague the\n\nregion.   However, such regulatory authority must be explicitly granted by the General\n\fAssembly.     Therefore, we conclude the enactment of Title V exceeds the statutory\n\npowers conferred upon the District under R.C. Chapter 6119.\n\n       {¶59} The appellants further contend that the Sewer District’s RSM Program is not\n\nauthorized under the Charter for the following three reasons: (1) the Charter dealt with\n\nsanitary sewerage issues and considerations that “share no kinship” with the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s RSM Program; (2) Title V conflicts with Charter provisions limiting the Sewer\n\nDistrict to charging for sewer fees; and (3) Title V conflicts with Charter provisions\n\nprohibiting the Sewer District from assuming ownership, control, or responsibility for\n\nlocally controlled systems without the local community’s written consent.\n\n       {¶60} Consistent with R.C. Chapter 6119, the Charter set forth the Sewer District’s\n\npurpose of “the establishment of a total wastewater control system for the collection,\n\ntreatment and disposal of waste-water within and without the District.” Exhibit A, ¶ 4,\n\n1975 Judgment. The Charter’s provisions pertain to the operation, construction, and\n\nfinancing of the Sewer District’s sewage treatment and other water pollution control\n\nfacilities, as well as local sewerage collection facilities and systems.     The Charter\n\nprovides the Sewer District with authority over “wastewater treatment and disposal\n\nfacilities, major interceptor sewers, all sewer regulator systems and devices, weirs,\n\nretaining basins, storm water handling facilities, and all other water pollution control\n\nfacilities.” Id. at ¶ 5(c).\n\n       {¶61} Through its enactment of Title V, the District unilaterally defined a “local\n\nstormwater system” and created an expansive definition of a “regional stormwater\n\fsystem” over which it claims the power to establish and administer its RSM Program.\n\nThe expansive scope of the “regional stormwater system” goes far beyond the scope of\n\nsewage treatment and waste water handling facilities under the Charter and encompasses\n\nthe following:\n\n       The entire system of watercourses, stormwater conveyance structures, and\n       Stormwater Control Measures in the Sewer District’s service area that are\n       owned and/or operated by the Sewer District or over which the Sewer\n       District has right of use for the management of stormwater, including both\n       naturally occurring and constructed facilities. * * *\n\nTitle V, Section 5.0218.\n\n       {¶62} Further, while the Sewer District may charge for “sewage treatment and\n\ndisposal,” the Charter does not authorize the District to impose a fee for a stormwater\n\nmanagement program.        The Charter contemplates charges assessed for the use of the\n\nSewer District’s wholly-owned treatment facilities, with rates encompassing planning\n\nexpenses, operation and maintenance expenses, and capital costs for existing and future\n\nwaste-water handling facilities. Exhibit A, ¶ 5(f), 1975 Judgment.\n\n       {¶63} Insofar as the Charter authorizes the district to assume the ownership,\n\nresponsibility, or liability for any local sewerage collection facilities and systems, it may\n\ndo so only at the request of the local community and upon mutually agreeable terms\n\nprovided for in a written agreement. Id. at ¶ 5(m)(2) and (4).        With regard to local\n\nsewerage and collection facilities, while the Sewer District was charged with developing\n\na “detailed integrated capital improvement plan for regional management of wastewater\n\ncollection and storm drainage,” it was within the confines of its authority “to plan local\n\fsewerage collection facilities and systems pursuant to Chapter 6119 of the Ohio Revised\n\nCode.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(3).      Also, the method of financing particular projects must be\n\n“agreed to between the District and the respective local communities at the time the\n\nproject is undertaken by the District.” Id. at ¶ 5(m)(5).\n\n       {¶64} Finally, in order to amend its Charter, the Sewer District is required to go\n\nthrough the Charter amendment process of R.C. 6119.051. “The approved petition filed\n\nunder R.C. 6119.02 and the approved plan of operation for the district filed under R.C.\n\n6119.04 may only be amended or modified by the Common Pleas Court upon a petition\n\nbeing filed containing a request for such amendment or modification.” Kucinich v.\n\nCleveland Regional Sewer Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3746034\"><a href=\"/opinion/3992887/kucinich-v-sewer-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3746034\"><a href=\"/opinion/3992887/kucinich-v-sewer-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Dist. 1979),\n\nsyllabus.    Any amendment to the Charter cannot exceed the authority conferred by R.C.\n\nChapter 6119.\n\n       {¶65} Here, the Sewer District’s board, whose composition is largely unknown to\n\nthe general public, met and decided the long-term future of all water management in the\n\nregion well into the next generation.\n\n       {¶66} There is no question the Sewer District and many of its individual board\n\nmembers have done great things over the years for the region. There is also no doubt\n\nthat there have been problems that must be addressed. The sheer size and power of the\n\nNortheast Ohio Regional Sewer District11 is daunting. The consent decree the District\n\nsigned with the Federal Environmental Agency in 2011 is enlightening:\n\n        11\n             Also known as “NEORSD.”\n\f        NEORSD serves all or part of 62 communities and over one million\npeople in a 350 square-mile tributary area, 80 square miles of which is\nserved by combined sewers. NEORSD is responsible for operation and\nmaintenance of 305 miles of interceptor sewers including 40 miles of\nintercommunity relief sewers.          The system includes 126 permitted\ncombined sewer overflow outfalls and 26 automated regulators. These\nfacilities were built as early as 1876.\n\n       NEORSD is responsible for operation and maintenance of three\nWWTPs [waste water treatment plants], Easterly, Southerly and Westerly,\nwhich were built in 1922, 1928, and 1922 respectively. Improvements to\nthese plants have been made continuously.\n\n      NEORSD is also responsible for operation and maintenance of the\nCombined Sewer Overflow Treatment Facility (CSOTF) located near the\nWesterly plant, which was constructed in 1983.\n\n       NEORSD states that it has invested over $2.0 billion in facilities and\ncollection system improvements since 1972, and has spent over $850\nmillion to reduce CSO discharges by nearly 50%.\n\n       NEORSD states that between 1972 and 2006, NEORSD constructed\nthe Northwest Interceptor, Cuyahoga Valley Interceptor, Southwest\nInterceptor and Heights/Hilltop Interceptor. These interceptors have\ndiverted approximately 1.65 billion gallons of sanitary flow out of the\ncombined system directly to the WWTPs.\n\n       In addition, NEORSD states that it has taken certain incremental\nsteps to reduce CSO discharges that it believes are in compliance with\nEPA’s CSO Policy. It states that these steps are:\n\n(a) NEORSD completed a system-wide CSO Facilities Plan Phase I Study\nin 1994;\n\n(b) Pursuant to its CSO NPDES Permit, NEORSD’s CSO Operational Plan\nwas submitted in 1998 and approved by Ohio EPA in 1999;\n\n(c) In 1995 NEORSD began developing its CSO Long Term Control Plan,\nwhich is embodied in separate Facilities Plans for the Mill Creek, Westerly,\nSoutherly and Easterly sewersheds. Facility planning efforts included\ninterceptor inspection and evaluation, extensive system investigation,\n\f      mapping and flow monitoring during facilities planning, and sewer and\n      stream modeling;\n\n      (d) NEORSD submitted for Ohio EPA approval the Mill Creek and\n      Westerly Facilities Plans in 1999, and the Southerly and Easterly Facilities\n      Plans in 2002;\n\n      (e) In 2008 NEORSD completed its studies of feasible alternatives to\n      minimize wet weather bypasses at the Southerly and Easterly WWTPs;\n\n      (f) Implementation of the District’s facilities plans has included\n      rehabilitation and early action projects in all three treatment plant service\n      areas. The early action projects have controlled approximately 480 million\n      gallons of CSO;\n\n      (g) NEORSD has completed construction of the major portion of the Mill\n      Creek Tunnel, which is designed to reduce overflows to Mill Creek by over\n      500 million gallons per year.\n\n      NEORSD states that it has imposed appropriate and necessary rate increases\n      to pay for these efforts. The District states that it has raised rates in 17 out\n      of the last 20 years, in amounts varying from 4.5% to 22.2%, resulting in\n      rate increases during this period of 350%.\n\nSee Case: 1:10-cv-02895-DCN Doc #: 23 Filed: 07/07/11.\n\n      {¶67} The view that an entity with the size and expanse of the Sewer District could\n\nredefine its own existence through Title V from the confines of a boardroom with limited\n\noversight and review is not supported by R.C. Chapter 6119. While local school boards\n\nand municipal entities struggle with limited budgets, the Sewer District expands its\n\nauthority and imposes its will on constituents with limited oversight and control.\n\nClearly, if regional entities like the Sewer District are going to expand their power and\n\nredefine their purpose, albeit for a claimed good purpose, it should be accomplished by\n\nthe legislature’s defining the terms and the scope of authority of these entities to make\n\fthese changes. Further, long-term stormwater management is interrelated with regional\n\nexpansion and what some have termed “urban sprawl.” Clearly, if one or the other is to\n\nbe comprehensively addressed, it must be done with authority conferred by the\n\nlegislature.\n\n       {¶68} Accordingly, we find that Title V exceeds the express statutory authority\n\ngranted to the Sewer District under R.C. Chapter 6119 and the authority conferred under\n\nthe Charter.       We further find that the stormwater fee is an unauthorized charge.\n\nAppellant’s first, second, and third assignments of error are sustained.\n\n       2.      Title V and Constitutional Provisions\n\n       {¶69} Having already sustained the first, second, and third assignments of error,\n\nwe need not address the constitutional challenges raised by appellants. Accordingly, we\n\nfind the fourth assignment of error is moot.\n\n       3.      Denial of Motion to Dismiss based on Failure to Join all Property\n               Owners\n\n       {¶70} For their fifth assigned error, the appellants contend that the trial court erred\n\nin denying their motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because all of the\n\nindividual property owners were not named as parties.     We disagree.\n\n       {¶71} Civ.R. 19(A) governs “[p]ersons to be joined if feasible,” and provides in\n\npart as follows:\n\n              A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a\n       party in the action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded\n       among those already parties, or (2) he claims an interest relating to the\n       subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in\n       his absence may (a) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to\n\f       protect that interest or (b) leave any of the persons already parties subject to\n       a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent\n       obligations by reason of his claimed interest, or (3) he has an interest\n       relating to the subject of the action as an assignor, assignee, subrogor, or\n       subrogee.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       {¶72} Joinder of all the thousands of property owners was not feasible, and the\n\nproperty owners’ interests were protected by the community law directors. See R.C.\n\n733.53 (“[t]he city director of law, when required to do so by resolution of the legislative\n\nauthority of the city, shall prosecute or defend on behalf of the city, all complaints, suits,\n\nand controversies in which the city is a party, and such other suits, matters, and\n\ncontroversies as he is, by resolution or ordinance, directed to prosecute”).\n\n       {¶73} In light of the above, the fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       4.     Post-Trial Amendments\n\n       {¶74} In their sixth and final assignment of error, the appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred when it oversaw post-trial amendments to Title V.\n\n       {¶75} The trial court’s February 2012 judgment concludes, in part, as follows:\n\n“[t]he Court will set a conference within 30 days and hear proposed changes to Title V *\n\n* *.   Upon its conclusion, [the District] shall submit a proposed journal entry not\n\ninconsistent with this opinion.”\n\n       {¶76} The appellants filed notices of appeal from the February 2012 judgment, but\n\nthis court dismissed the appeals as not being taken from a final order because the trial\n\ncourt contemplated further action. N.E. Ohio Regional Sewer Dist. v. Bath Twp., 8th\n\fDist. Cuyahoga Nos. 98108 and 98112, motion Nos. 453509 and 453511, respectively.\n\nThe appellants filed motions to reconsider, which this court denied, stating as follows:\n\n       The trial court’s opinion on February 15, 2012 specifically directs that, at\n       the conclusion of a future hearing, the “[p]laintiff shall submit a proposed\n       journal entry not inconsistent with this opinion.” The opinion clearly\n       contemplates that future action must be taken before any judgment of the\n       court becomes final. Therefore, it is not an appealable order.\n\nId. at motion Nos. 453917 and 453855.\n\n       {¶77} In light of the above, the trial court’s February 2012 judgment was not its\n\nfinal judgment and its subsequent judgment issued in June 2012 was proper.                 The\n\nseventh assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.\n\n       B.   The Sewer District’s Cross-Appeal\n\n       {¶78} In the trial court’s February 2012 opinion, which it issued after the bench\n\ntrial, the court found that certain provisions in Title V needed to be modified; the court\n\ncharged the District with making the modifications before legally implementing Title V.\n\nThe District revamped the offending provisions, which were presented to the trial court in\n\na June 2012 report.   The trial court found the District’s revisions acceptable and adopted\n\nthem in its June 2012 final judgment. The District’s assignments of error relate to\n\nfindings the trial court made in its February 2012 opinion.\n\n       {¶79} Under its assignments of error, the District contends that (1) the trial court\n\nerred in finding that there was no rational basis for distinguishing between residential\n\nproperty owners and nonresidential property owners with respect to the stormwater fee;\n\n(2) the trial court had no legal basis for requiring the District to provide the school\n\fsystems with appropriate curricula for grades 1–12; (3) the trial court had no legal basis\n\nfor requiring the District to come up with a formula for accrediting the costs of licensed\n\nengineers for completing any applications for credit; and (4) the trial court had no legal\n\nbasis for requiring the District to revise, or to increase the amount of, the community\n\ncost-share set forth in Title V.\n\n       {¶80} Since the trial court rendered its decision, the District voluntarily adopted\n\nchanges to Title V that rendered its assignments of error moot.     Generally, an appeal\n\nfrom a judgment with which the appellant has voluntarily complied renders the appeal\n\nmoot. Sunkin v.

In any event, because we have already determined that Title V is invalid, we\n\nneed not address the District’s assignments of error.\n\n       {¶81} Nonetheless, we do express concern over the trial court’s revisions to Title\n\nV in an effort to correct what the court viewed as infirmities. It is not within the\n\nprovince of the court to draft such measures.     Moreover, any expansion of the Sewer\n\nDistrict’s powers, including the allowance for implementation of a stormwater\n\nmanagement program and the parameters thereof, are matters that must be determined by\n\nthe legislature.\n\f                                      VIII. Conclusion\n\n       {¶82} The trial court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss is affirmed. We reverse\n\nthe   trial   court’s   decision   granting   partial   summary judgment      in   favor   of\n\nplaintiff-appellee/cross-appellant and its decision denying the motion for a permanent\n\ninjunction.    The judgment of the trial court on the declaratory action is reversed;\n\njudgment is entered in favor of appellants as follows:\n\n       1.      The Sewer District is enjoined from implementing Title V and its Regional\n\n               Stormwater Management Program.           The Sewer District had no authority\n\n               under R.C. Chapter 6119 or its Charter to enact it.\n\n       2.      The Sewer District is enjoined from implementing, levying, and collecting\n\n               its stormwater fee.     The Sewer District has no authority under R.C.\n\n               Chapter 6119 or its Charter to enact said fee.\n\n       {¶83} Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n\n        It is ordered that appellants recover from appellee costs herein taxed.\n\n        The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n        It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common\n\npleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of\n\nthe Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\n\nSEAN C. GALLAGHER, JUDGE\n\fKENNETH A. ROCCO, J., CONCURS (WITH SEPARATE OPINION);\nLARRY A. JONES, SR., P.J., DISSENTS (WITH SEPARATE OPINION)\n\n\nKENNETH A. ROCCO, J., CONCURRING:\n\n        {¶84} While I agree with the majority opinion’s disposition of this appeal, I write\n\nseparately only because I disagree with the majority opinion’s characterization of the\n\nSewer District’s actions in ¶ 47. Using the word “usurp” to describe what the Sewer\n\nDistrict sought to accomplish is too strong.\n\n        {¶85} In my view, the district simply was making a well-meaning effort to deal\n\nwith Northern Ohio’s need for clean water. That need should be a high priority in this\n\nstate, especially in light of the fact that Lake Erie and its watercourses arguably are\n\nOhio’s greatest natural resource.\n\n        {¶86} As the majority opinion suggests, the need for clean water is one that can no\n\nlonger be handled locally. The Ohio legislature, nevertheless, delegated most of the\n\nresponsibility of safeguarding this natural resource to local governments, thus abdicating\n\nits proper role. Nature abhors a vacuum. So, too, apparently, does the Sewer District.\n\nBecause I believe that the District merely was making a misguided attempt to deal with a\n\ncomprehensive problem that affects the health and welfare of the citizens of this area, I\n\nwould choose to describe the Sewer District’s action as having inappropriately assumed\n\nthe mantle of responsibility from which the government of the state of Ohio has walked\n\naway.\n\fLARRY A. JONES, SR., P.J., DISSENTING AND CONCURRING:\n\n        {¶87} Respectfully, I dissent as to the decision to sustain the first, second, and\n\nthird assignments of error of appellants’ appeal.          I concur as to the decision to overrule\n\n(1) appellants’ fifth assignment of error regarding the denial of their motion to dismiss\n\nbased on failure to join all property owners and (2) appellants’ sixth assignment of error\n\nregarding the trial court’s jurisdiction to make post-trial amendments.            Moreover, while I\n\nagree with the majority that the appellees’ cross-appeal is moot, I do not share the same\n\nconcerns about issues raised in the appeal as the majority does.\n\nI. Authority for Title V\n\n        {¶88} The powers granted to a regional water and sewer district under R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 are “very broad.” Wyatt v. Trimble Twp. Waste Water Treatment Dist.,\n\n4th Dist. Athens No. 1521, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 5749, *6 (Nov. 3, 1992). The\n\nmajority agrees that the “Sewer District’s authority is broad,” but it is “unable to conclude\n\nthat the legislature intended to allow the Sewer District to expand its statutory authority\n\nthrough Title V and its RSM Program and impose an unauthorized charge.” Majority\n\nOpinion, ¶ 55.\n\n        {¶89} I do not believe that Title V is an unlawful expansion of the District’s\n\nstatutory authority; rather, I believe that it is specifically authorized under the governing\n\nstatutory authority, both procedurally12 and as I will discuss in more detail, substantively.\n\n\n        12\n           See R.C. 6119.051(A), providing that “[a]t any time after the creation of a water and sewer\ndistrict, the district, after action by its board of trustees, may file a petition in the court of common\npleas requesting the order of such court permitting the district to: (A) Increase or add to its purposes\n\f Further, I believe that the District’s Program is authorized under its Charter.            I also do\n\nnot believe that the fee imposed under the Program is an unauthorized charge.\n\nExpress Authority under R.C. Chapter 6119\n\n       {¶90} The purpose of a regional water and sewer district is for “either or both” of\n\nthe following purposes: “(A) [t]o supply water to users within and without the district”;\n\nand “(B) [t]o provide for the collection, treatment, and disposal of waste water within and\n\nwithout the district.”     R.C. 6119.01(A) and (B).          “Waste water” is defined as “any\n\nstorm water and any water containing sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or\n\ncontaminants derived from the prior use of the water.”                  (Emphasis added.)        R.C.\n\n6119.011(K).\n\n       {¶91} The majority holds that under the statutory definitions, in order to qualify as\n\nwaste water, storm water must be mixed with water containing sewage or industrial waste\n\nor other pollutants or contaminants.       I disagree.\n\n       {¶92} It is true that, generally, the word “and” is a conjunctive.

Specifically, if\n\nthe District could manage storm water only if it was mixed with polluted or contaminated\n\nwater, then it would also necessarily only be able to manage polluted or contaminated\n\nwater if it was mixed with storm water. I do not think that the General Assembly\n\nintended such a result.\n\n       {¶95} I am not persuaded by the majority’s reliance on Reith v. McGill Smith\n\nPunshon, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3772291\"><a href=\"/opinion/4016749/reith-v-mcgill-smith-punshon-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2005-Ohio-4852, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Dist.), which\n\nwas decided on a statute-of-limitations issue on the plaintiffs-property owners’ claims of\n\nnegligence and trespass due to flooding of their driveway, yard, and home.\n\n       {¶96} In deciding the limitations issue, the court had to consider whether there was\n\na “legal distinction between storm water when it is above the ground and storm water\n\nwhen it is channeled through underground pipes.”    Id. at ¶ 24.   The plaintiffs contended\n\nthat surface water becomes sewer water once it enters an underground pipe, but the court\n\ndisagreed, stating that “[s]ewage is defined as any substance containing excrement, while\n\nwaste water means any storm water containing sewage or other pollutants.” Id. at ¶ 29.\n\fThe majority relies on this narrow statement for its finding that storm water must contain\n\npollutants or contaminants.\n\n       {¶97} But, the issue in Reith differed from the issue here, and if the First Appellate\n\nDistrict intended to hold that in all instances waste water can only be storm water mixed\n\nwith polluted water, I respectfully disagree.\n\n       {¶98} Morever, I am not persuaded by the majority’s citation to the District’s\n\ndefinitions in other Titles of its Code of Regulations to support its finding that waste\n\nwater is limited to only storm water mixed with pollutants or contaminants.             The\n\ndefinitions in those Titles apply to those Titles.     I believe for our purpose, we are\n\nrestricted to the definition of waste water set forth in R.C. 6119.011(K).       Under that\n\nsection, I would find that waste water can be (1) “any storm water” or (2)       “any water\n\ncontaining sewage or industrial waste or other pollutants or contaminants derived from\n\nthe prior use of the water.”\n\n       {¶99} The majority states that the General Assembly has charged other statutorily\n\ncreated agencies such as watershed districts under R.C. 6105.12 or conservancy districts\n\nunder R.C. 6101.04 to deal with stormwater-related issues.        But neither a watershed\n\ndistrict created under R.C. 6105.12 nor a conservancy district created under R.C. 6101.04\n\nhave the exclusive authority to implement a program such as the District’s Program.\n\nTherefore, the issue in this case is whether the District has the authority to implement its\n\nProgram.\n\f       {¶100} I am also not persuaded by the proposition that the governing statutes\n\nmandate that waste water be “‘collected’ and ‘treated’ and ‘disposed of,’ conjunctively,”\n\nand that a regional sewer district is an “entity that exists to do that “‘collecting, treating,\n\nand disposing of waste water.’”\n\n       {¶101} In my view, the plain meaning of R.C. 6119.01(B) grants the District\n\nauthorization to collect, treat, or dispose of waste water.   To hold that it must do all three\n\nconjunctively would create absurd results.\n\nTitle V vis-a-vis the District’s Charter\n\n       {¶102} The Charter states that the District’s purpose was the “establishment of a\n\ntotal wastewater control system for the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater\n\nwithin and without the District * * *.” Exhibit A to 1975 Charter, ¶ 4. The Charter\n\nfurther provides that the District\n\n       shall have regulatory authority over all local sewerage collection facilities\n       and systems in the District, including both storm and sanitary sewer\n       systems. This authority shall be exercised by the District through rules and\n       regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Chapter 6119 of\n       the Ohio Revised Code.\n\nId. at ¶ 6(m)(1).\n\n       {¶103} Moreover, the Charter charged the District with developing a plan for\n\nregional storm water management:\n\n       [t]he District shall develop a detailed integrated capital improvement plan\n       for regional management of wastewater collection and storm drainage\n       designed to identify a capital improvement program for the solution of all\n       intercommunity drainage problems (both storm and sanitary) in the District.\n\fId. at ¶ 5(m)(3).\n\n       {¶104} The charge given to the District in its Charter “shares kinship” with Title\n\nV, which stated purpose is to “establish the Regional Stormwater Management Program\n\nthrough which the District and each Member Community served by the Regional\n\nStormwater Management Program shall work in a cooperative manner to address\n\nstormwater management problems.”          Title V, Section 5.0303.     Further, Title V\n\ndescribes the Program as\n\n       [a]ll activities necessary to operate, maintain, improve, administer, and\n       provide Stormwater Management of the Regional Stormwater System and\n       to facilitate and integrate activities that benefit and improve watershed\n       conditions across the District’s service area.\n\nId. at Section 5.0219.\n\n       {¶105} Given the above, I would hold that the District’s Charter authorized\n\nimplementation of its Program as set forth in Title V.\n\nOwnership, Control, or Responsibility for Locally-Controlled Systems without Local\nCommunity’s Written Consent\n\n       {¶106} I do not see the District’s Program as conflicting with the requirement, as\n\nstated in the Charter, that the District cannot own, control, or be responsible for\n\nlocally-controlled systems without the local community’s written consent.\n\n       {¶107} Title V explicitly provides that the District’s member communities will\n\nremain responsible for owning and maintaining their own facilities and systems.      For\n\nexample, section 5(k) of the Title provides as follows: “[i]ndividual suburban\n\ncommunities will retain ownership of all local suburban facilities, subject to the\n\fprovisions of subsection ‘m’ below.” Subsection m provides that the District will not be\n\nresponsible for any local sewerage collection facility absent written consent between the\n\nDistrict and the respective local community.\n\n       {¶108} Thus, under the plain language of Title V each member community will\n\nremain responsible for maintaining its local sewerage collection facilities and systems.\n\nTo that end, the District stipulated on the record that it will not undertake any\n\nconstruction projects under Title V, without the consent of the member community in\n\nwhich the project will be undertaken. See April 2011 opinion at 3; February opinion at\n\n12.\n\n                           II. The Stormwater Fee Under Title V\n\n       {¶109} I disagree with the majority’s finding that the stormwater fee is “not a\n\nlegitimate ‘rental or other charge’ under R.C. 6119.09.”    Majority Opinion, ¶ 56.\n\n       {¶110} The majority finds that Wyatt, 4th Dist. Athens No. 1521, 1992 Ohio App.\n\nLEXIS 5749, is completely distinguishable from this case because the issue there\n\ninvolved a tap-in fee for premises to be connected to an existing sanitary sewer and waste\n\nwater treatment project.   The fact remains, however, that the Fourth Appellate District\n\nconcluded that a sewer district’s powers under R.C. Chapter 6119 are “very broad.”      The\n\nbroadness, as it relates to fees or charges, is indicated by the very use of the words “other\n\ncharge” in R.C. 6119.09.    The “other charge” in Wyatt was a tap-in fee, while the “other\n\ncharge” here was a fee for stormwater management.           I believe both are permissible\n\nunder R.C. Chapter 6119.\n\f       {¶111} Further, I believe that the projects that will be funded through the fees in\n\nthis case are for the benefit of the member communities and property owners.\n\n       {¶112} For example, one of the District’s experts, Hector Cyre,13 was of the\n\nopinion that projects under the Program would “provide service to not only the member\n\ncommunities individually and cumulatively, but to the property owners within those\n\ncommunities.”\n\n       {¶113} Another example of the benefits of the District’s Program from the\n\ntestimony of two mayors from the non-appealing member communities.14 The mayors\n\ntestified about “serious” regional stormwater problems in their communities, such as\n\nhome and yard flooding, damage to the Metroparks, road damage, and degradation and\n\nsiltation of the Shaker Lakes and dams.         The mayors testified that they believed the\n\nDistrict’s Program will help to alleviate these problems and, thus, provide an “enormous\n\nbenefit” not only to their residents, but to residents of the region generally.\n\n       {¶114} Because I believe that the District’s Program was authorized under R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 and that it provides a benefit, I would not be persuaded by the appellants’\n\nargument that the District was required to pay for its Program through other\n\nrevenue-generating procedures.       According to the appellants, the District should have\n\n\n       13\n         Cyre, founder and owner of Water Resource Associates, has provided consultation for\nhundreds of stormwater utility programs throughout the United States and internationally since the\nearly 1970s.\n       14\n         See the testimony of Earl Leiken, Mayor of Shaker Heights and Bruce Rinker, Mayor of\nMayfield Village.\n\fsought to raise revenues through the procedures outlined in R.C. 6119.17, 6119.18, or\n\n6119.42.\n\n       {¶115} R.C. 6119.17 and 6118.19 require voter approval; but, they each are for a\n\ntax. For the reasons I will discuss below, I would find that the fee here is not a tax.\n\n       {¶116} R.C. 6119.42 governs special assessments and provides in part that:\n\n       [a]ny regional water and sewer district may levy and collect special\n       assessments as provided in Chapter 6119 of the Revised Code. The board of\n       trustees of such district may assess upon abutting, adjacent, contiguous, or\n       other specially benefited lots or lands in the district all or any part of the\n       cost connected with the improvement of any street, alley, or public road or\n       place, or a property or easement of the district by constructing any water\n       resource project or part thereof which the board declares conducive to the\n       public health, safety, convenience, or welfare * * *.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       {¶117} Pursuant to the plain language of the statute, the construction of a water\n\nresource project is incidental to improving “any street, alley, or public road or place, or a\n\nproperty or easement of the district.”      Such is not the circumstance here and R.C.\n\n6119.42 is, therefore, not applicable.\n\n       {¶118} The appellants also contend that the District could have issued water\n\nresource revenue bonds and notes under R.C. 6119.12. The District could have; but it\n\nchose to fund its Program through a fee (“other charge”) imposed under R.C. 6119.09,\n\nand I would find that proper.\n\n       {¶119} Further, I would find untrue the appellants’ contention that, under the\n\nDistrict’s Charter, the only fees the District are allowed to charge are sewer fees.\n\n       {¶120} The Charter specifically provides that\n\f        [a]ny projects not financed through the Ohio Water Development Authority,\n        State of Ohio or Federal Government would be financed in such a manner\n        as may be deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees.\n\nExhibit A to 1975 Charter, at ¶ 5(e)(3).\n\n        {¶121} The District’s Board of Trustees unanimously approved the storm water fee\n\non January 7, 2010, and therefore, I believe the fee is proper under the Charter.\n\n        {¶122} The majority declines to address the application of Drees Co. v. Hamilton\n\nTwp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012-Ohio-2370, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, to this case, but I believe it\n\nis instructive. In Drees, the Ohio Supreme Court held that “impact fees” imposed by\n\nHamilton Township, a limited-home-rule township, were a prohibited form of taxation.\n\n        {¶123} The township’s board of trustees passed a resolution that set forth a\n\nschedule of fees to be charged to applicants for zoning certificates for new construction or\n\ndevelopment.    Four categories of fees were included in the resolution: (1) a road-impact\n\nfee; (2) a fire-protection-impact fee; (3) a police-protection-impact fee; and (4) a\n\npark-impact fee.   The purpose of the resolution was set forth as follows:\n\n        The purpose of the impact fee is to benefit the property by providing the\n        Township with adequate funds to provide the same level of service to that\n        property that the Township currently affords previously developed\n        properties.\n\n        The Resolution assesses an impact fee to previously undeveloped property,\n        and property undergoing redevelopment, to offset increased services and\n        improvements because of the development.\n\nId. at ¶ 3.\n\n        {¶124} The amount of the fees varied based on the land use.      The fees collected\n\nwere to be deposited in impact fee accounts, rather than into a general fund.   Each of the\n\ffour types of fees had its own account, and the funds in each of the four accounts were to\n\nbe used only for the purpose of its accompanying category.\n\n       {¶125} The trial court and the Twelfth Appellate District upheld the imposition of\n\nthe fees, finding, among other things, that they were not a prohibited form of taxation.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court disagreed, however.\n\n       {¶126} The court relied on its analysis in State ex rel. Petroleum Underground\n\nStorage Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Withrow, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991),\n\nin determining whether the impact fees were a fee as opposed to a tax.        At issue in\n\nWithrow were assessments imposed by the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Release\n\nCompensation Board on owners and operators of underground storage tanks.              The\n\nassessments helped fund the Petroleum Underground Storage Tank Financial Assurance\n\nFund, whose purpose was to reimburse the owners and operators of the tanks for the costs\n\nof corrective actions taken when petroleum was released into the environment, and to\n\ncompensate third parties for bodily injury or property damage, or both, resulting from\n\nsuch a release.   The proceeds from the assessments were segregated from the general\n\nfund of the state treasury.\n\n       {¶127} The Ohio Supreme Court cited four reasons for finding that the\n\nassessments in Withrow were a fee rather than a tax.      First, the court noted that the\n\nassessments were imposed to advance regulatory measures that addressed the\n\nenvironmental problems caused by the leaking underground storage tanks. Pursuant to\n\nstatutory regulations, owners and operators of underground storage tanks were strictly\n\fliable to take corrective measures when leaks occurred and to pay damages for the leaks.\n\nThe fund into which the fees were paid ensured that owners and operators could meet\n\nthose statutory requirements.\n\n         {¶128} Next, the court noted that the assessments were not placed in the general\n\nfund and were to be used only for “‘narrow and specific purposes, all directly related to\n\n[underground storage tank] problems.’” Drees at ¶ 18, quoting Withrow at 116-117.\n\n         {¶129} Third, the court stated that a “‘fee is a charge imposed by a government in\n\nreturn for a service it provides.’” Drees at ¶ 19, quoting Withrow at 117. In Withrow,\n\nthe fund into which the fees were paid “operated essentially, as insurance coverage for\n\ncatastrophic damage caused by leaking tanks.” Drees at ¶ 23.\n\n         {¶130} And fourth, the court was “persuaded by the fact that when the unobligated\n\nbalance in the fund exceeded a certain amount, there would be no assessment for that\n\nyear.”    Drees at ¶ 20.    Likewise, if the fund “dipped below a certain amount, the\n\nassessing authority was permitted to charge a supplemental assessment.” Id.        In light\n\nof this, the court noted that the “‘assessment appears to function more as a fee than as a\n\ntax, because a specific charge in return for a service is involved.’” Drees at id., quoting\n\nWithrow at id.\n\n         {¶131} Applying Withrow to the facts in Drees, the court found that the township’s\n\nassessments were taxes. The court first noted that the assessments the township imposed\n\nwere not in “furtherance of statutes designed to protect the public from harms associated\n\nwith a specific industry,” as compared to the fee imposed in Withrow.    Drees at ¶ 21.\n\f       {¶132} Second, the court noted that although the funds collected by the township\n\nwere segregated and not placed into the general fund, the funds were “spent on typical\n\ntownship expenses inuring to the benefit of the entire community.” Id. at ¶ 22.\n\n       {¶133} Next noted by the court was that the fee imposed by the township did not\n\nprovide the assessed party any “particular service above that provided to any other\n\ntaxpayer * * *.” Id. at ¶ 23. In other words, as taxpayers and residents of the township,\n\nthe assessed parties were entitled to police and fire protection and use of the township’s\n\nparks and roadways: “targets of the assessment receive no greater benefit than any other\n\ntaxpayer despite the payment of the additional assessment.” Id.\n\n       {¶134} In regard to the fourth and final Withrow factor, the court in Drees found\n\nthat the spending of the funds collected through the township’s assessment was based on\n\nthe “whims of government,” as opposed to the assessment in Withrow, which was “tied to\n\nevents.”    Id. at ¶ 24.\n\n       {¶135} Considering this case in light of Withrow and Drees, I would find that the\n\ncharge here is more like the assessment in Withrow, that the Ohio Supreme Court held\n\nwas a fee and not a tax.\n\n       {¶136} First, the fee is being imposed by the District to advance regulatory\n\nmeasures. Specifically, the purpose of Title V is to “establish the Regional Stormwater\n\nManagement Program through which the District and each Member Community served\n\nby the Regional Stormwater Management Program shall work in a cooperative manner to\n\naddress stormwater management problems.” Title V at Section 5.0303.\n\f         {¶137} A regional sewer district is an\n\n         independent political subdivision created under R. C. Chapter 6119, and * *\n         * everything related to it is governed by R. C. Chapter 6119. This includes\n         its formation and operation. The cities, counties, townships and the courts\n         are bound by the provisions of R. C. Chapter 6119, and both the formation\n         of the district and its operation must be conducted within the confines of R.\n         C. [C]hapter 6119.\n\nKucinich v. Cleveland Regional Sewer Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3746034\"><a href=\"/opinion/3992887/kucinich-v-sewer-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15-16, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3746034\"><a href=\"/opinion/3992887/kucinich-v-sewer-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(8th Dist.1979).\n\n         {¶138} Thus, Title V is regulatory in nature because it is “designed to address\n\nstormwater problems,” aligned with the purpose of providing for the “collection,\n\ntreatment, and disposal of waste water” under R.C. 6119.01(B).\n\n         {¶139} The second Withrow factor suggesting that the charge is truly a fee rather\n\nthan a tax is present here.   That is, the funds generated from the fees will be maintained\n\nin a separate account “dedicated to the implementation and administration of the Regional\n\nStormwater Program * * *.” Title V at Section 5.0701.\n\n         {¶140} Third, the charge imposed by the District is in return for the specific\n\nservice of managing stormwater runoff, which suggests that it is a fee rather than a tax.\n\nAnd fourth, the final Withrow factor suggests that the District’s charge is a fee rather than\n\na tax.   Specifically, the charge is based on the increased demand for stormwater services,\n\nand the fee that each property owner is required to pay under Title V is in return for the\n\nspecific service of managing the stormwater runoff.\n\n         {¶141} In light of the above, I would hold that the charge imposed by the District\n\nis not a tax, but rather, a permissible “other charge” under R.C. 6119.09.\n\f                        III. Title V and Constitutional Provisions\n\n       {¶142} Because the majority sustains the appellants’ first, second, and third\n\nassignments of error, it does not address the constitutional challenges raised by\n\nappellants.   Because I disagree with the majority, I would review their constitutional\n\nchallenges and find them to be without merit for the reasons briefly discussed below.\n\nA. Equal Protection\n\n       {¶143} The appellants contend that Title V violates the Equal Protection Clauses\n\nof the United States and Ohio Constitutions because it treats similarly-situated persons\n\ndifferently in that it: (1) is imposed only on property owners within the District’s sanitary\n\nservice area, as opposed to all property owners within the District’s county-wide\n\nauthority; (2) treats residential and non-residential property owners differently without a\n\nrational basis for doing so; (3) discriminates against small lot owners; (4) ignores the\n\nimpact of stormwater runoff from non-impervious surfaces; (5) exempts certain properties\n\nwithout a rational basis; (6) offers credits without a rational basis; and (7) discriminates\n\nagainst some property owners who, for “remedial work benefitting the general public and\n\nothers who do not pay,” will be forced to “pay to fix runoff problems others create.”\n\n       {¶144} “[A] statute that does not implicate a fundamental right or a suspect\n\nclassification does not violate equal-protection principles if it is rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate government interest.”       State v.

Here, neither a\n\ffundamental right nor a suspect classification are implicated; therefore, review of Title V\n\nshould determine whether it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\n\n       {¶145} “Ohio courts grant substantial deference to the legislature when conducting\n\nan equal-protection rational-basis review.” Williams, supra at ¶ 40,         citing State v.\n\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531, 2000-Ohio-428, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">728</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n Application only to Property Owners in District’s Sanitary Service Area\n\n       {¶146} The appellants first contend that the Program violates equal protection\n\nsafeguards because, although the “original Charter gave the Sewer District authority\n\nthroughout Cuyahoga County,” the current Program “applies only to properties within the\n\nDistrict’s Service Area.”\n\n       {¶147} Specifically, the appellants contend that “multiple arbitrary classifications\n\namong Sewer District properties” will be created because Cuyahoga County property\n\nowners in the non-member communities and excluded portions of member communities\n\nwill not be required to pay the fee, while some property owners in member communities\n\nwill be required to pay the fee, despite all the property owners being located in the same\n\nwatersheds in the same county.\n\n       {¶148} The District’s authority is limited to its member communities, who\n\nvoluntarily joined the District in whole or part. Thus, I would find the appellants’\n\nargument is without merit.\n\fResidential vs. Non-Residential Property Owners\n\n       {¶149} The appellants contend that the District’s formulas for charging residential\n\nand non-residential properties “reveals their arbitrary, discriminatory effects.”     The trial\n\ncourt agreed, and ordered an adjustment.       That adjustment is the part of the District’s\n\ncross-appeal and will be addressed in my discussion there.\n\nSmall Lot Owners\n\n       {¶150} The appellants also contend that the District’s fee schedule discriminates\n\nagainst small lot owners. They rely on the testimony of Michael Clar, their expert\n\nwitness, who testified that the fee for small lot owners is inequitable because larger lots\n\nwill produce proportionately more runoff-water than is accounted for in the District’s\n\nformulary.    The District presented the testimony of Hector Cyre, Andrew Reese, and\n\nFrancis Greenland, however, that I would find demonstrated a rational basis for the\n\ndifference.\n\n       {¶151} For example, Reese, a hydrologist who has worked primarily in the area of\n\nmunicipal stormwater engineering, testified that, in addition to being the most common\n\nway for a district to calculate the fee, the District considered the particular situation of the\n\nmember communities and used the system it found most “equitable” and “accurate.”\n\nReese testified that other options were considered along with the impervious surface\n\nmethod, but based on the District’s particular situation, the District concluded that the\n\nimpervious surface measurement method would most fairly distribute the costs.\n\nExemptions\n\f       {¶152} Further, based on testimony of some of the District’s witnesses, I would\n\nfind a rational basis existed for the exemptions, which are for the following properties:\n\npublic road rights-of-way; airport runways and taxiways; railroad rights-of-way; parcels\n\nwith less than 400 square feet of impervious surface; and “[p]arcels whose use has been\n\ndesignated as a Non-Self Supporting Municipal Functions owned by Member\n\nCommunities.”\n\n       {¶153} Greenland, the director of watershed programs for the District, testified\n\nthat public roads are exempt from the Program because they function as part of the storm\n\ndrainage system, and are highly engineered and designed to deal with drainage issues and\n\nthe proper conveyance of stormwater.       Greenland also testified that public roadways,\n\nunlike private ones, are routinely maintained by local governments through allocation of\n\npublic funds, thus, the reason for their exemption.\n\n       {¶154} Further Cyre, founder and owner of Water Resource Associates,        testified\n\nabout the tendency to exempt public roads.      According to Cyre, public roads are often\n\nexempt because the municipality has been the “primary installer of the stormwater\n\ninfrastructure,” and has “borne a large proportion of the capital cost of putting storm\n\nsewers and inlets and catch basins in.”   Moreover, the street surface itself is sometimes a\n\ncomponent of the stormwater system.\n\n       {¶155} Cyre also testified about the exemption for airport runways and taxiways.\n\nAccording to Cyre, “airports are among the most controlled sites around,” meaning that\n\nthey have runway areas, ramps, tarmacs, fueling stations, and de-icing pads, all of which\n\f“get stormwater off of the surfaces and into a control facility” such as a detention facility\n\nor wetland.\n\n       {¶156} Greenland testified about the exemption for railroad rights-of-way as\n\nfollows: “[r]ailroad rights-of-way essentially are large linear ribbons, with highly\n\nengineered ballasts.     Any railroad is designed to really mimic an impervious surface.             It\n\ngets the water up and out really, in their linear, ribbon-like nature.”\n\n       {¶157} Greenland further testified about the exemption for “non-self-supporting\n\nmunicipal functions.” 15      Greenland explained that the exemption was based on the\n\nexemption in the court order establishing the District.16 Further, the exemption was a\n\ncost-cutting measure for the municipalities.\n\n       {¶158} In regard to the exemption for parcels with less than 400 square feet of\n\nimpervious surface, Greenland testified that the District chose that cut-off because many\n\nof those properties did not even show on the aerial photographs, which is how the\n\nimpervious surface measurements are taken.\n\n\n       15\n          “Non-self-supporting municipal functions” are defined as “[m]unicipal functions of Member\nCommunities that are exempt from sewage charges as provided for in the judicial orders establishing\nthe District. This exemption applies to municipal buildings which can be shown to house functions\nthat are not proprietary in nature, including city halls, police and fire departments, service garages,\nand recreational facilities such as parks, playgrounds, indoor recreational facilities, swimming pools,\nand ice rinks.” Title V, Section 5.0214.\n       16\n          The original court order establishing the District provided: “All non-self supporting\nmunicipal functions of the City of Cleveland shall continue to receive sewage service free of charge\nand the Board of Trustees shall afford the same treatment to similar non-self supporting municipal\nfunctions of the suburban municipalities as soon as possible after it commences operation of the\nsystem.”\n\fStormwater Runoff from Non-Impervious Surfaces\n\n       {¶159} According to the appellants, the District’s program is also unconstitutional\n\nbecause it “ignores the significant stormwater runoff impact from non-impervious\n\nsurfaces.”    The District presented testimony demonstrating why impervious surfaces are\n\nused. Through that testimony, it was explained that because the regional system consists\n\nmostly of natural watercourses, it was more fair and equitable to use impervious surfaces\n\nto calculate the fee.   Prior to arriving at that determination, other funding mechanisms\n\nwere evaluated.    But it was determined that basing the fee solely on impervious surfaces\n\nwould be the most equitable way to apportion the costs of the Program. I would hold\n\nthat the District’s determination was constitutionally sound and proper under both R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 and the District’s Charter.\n\nStormwater Education Credit\n\n       {¶160} The appellants contend that the stormwater education credit “lacks all trace\n\nof a connection to either the school’s runoff impacts or to the Sewer District’s purported *\n\n* * goals.”     I disagree.   The credit was designed to educate youth about utilizing\n\nstormwater management practices, such as the use of rain barrels or rain gardens.     With\n\neducation about these practices, the District hopes that future demand on the stormwater\n\nsystem will be reduced, which is in line with the District’s goals.\n\fB. Substantive Due Process\n\n       {¶161} As with the equal protection review, the appellants’ claims of substantive\n\ndue process violations is under a rational basis standard because neither a fundamental\n\nright nor suspect classification is implicated.     Akron v. Rasdan, 105 Ohio App.3d\n\n164,172-173, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3691369\"><a href=\"/opinion/3943289/akron-v-rasdan/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Dist.1995).\n\n       {¶162} The crux of the appellants’ claim of due process violation is that the fees\n\nare not equitable and the “impervious surface calculation method” is arbitrary and\n\nunreasonable.   I will discuss the extent to which the fees differ between residential and\n\nnon-residential property owners in addressing the District’s cross-appeal.     On all other\n\ngrounds, for the reason discussed herein, I would find the appellants’ claim of due\n\nprocess violation meritless.\n\nC. Home Rule Amendment and Utility Power\n\n       {¶163} Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution is commonly referred to\n\nas the Home Rule Amendment, and authorizes municipalities\n\n       to exercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and enforce\n       within their limits such local police, sanitary and other similar regulations,\n       as are not in conflict with general laws.\n\n       {¶164} Article XVIII, Section 4, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities\n\nutility power as follows:\n\n       [a]ny municipality may acquire, construct, own, lease and operate within or\n       without its corporate limits, any public utility the product or service of\n       which is or is to be supplied to the municipality or its inhabitants, and may\n       contract with others for any such product or service.\n\f       {¶165} The appellants contend that Title V violates the Home Rule Amendment\n\nand its right to power over their utilities. I disagree.\n\n       {¶166} Of significant importance to my resolution of these issues is the fact that\n\nthe District’s member communities voluntarily joined the District. See Seven Hills v.\n\nCleveland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3739218\"><a href=\"/opinion/3986674/seven-hills-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3739218\"><a href=\"/opinion/3986674/seven-hills-v-cleveland/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Dist.1980) (stating that R.C.\n\nChapter 6119 “must necessarily be construed as not contemplating involuntary\n\ninclusion.”). In joining the District, the communities agreed that the District “shall have\n\nregulatory authority over all local sewerage collection facilities and systems in the\n\nDistrict, including both storm and sanitary sewer systems.”                  Title V, ¶ 5(m)(1).\n\nMoreover, under Title V, the District seeks collaboration with its member communities.17\n\n From my view, the District does not seek to manage stormwater runoff in a vacuum.\n\nAnd, in fact, many of the 56 member communities did collaborate with the District in\n\ndeveloping the Program under Title V, and only 11 member communities are appealing.\n\nThe remaining 80% of the member communities have voiced no objection to the trial\n\ncourt’s judgments.\n\n       17\n           See, e.g., Title V, Section 5.0502, stating that the District’s “services, programs, and\ninitiatives shall be supportive of District and Member Community goals and objectives * * *”; Section\n5.0504, stating that the District “shall establish Watershed Advisory Committees,” the rules, policies\nand procedures for which “shall be available for Member Community review and comment”; Section\n5.0504(b), stating that the Watershed Advisory Committee “shall * * * [a]ssist the District in\ndetermining Regional Stormwater Management Program activities and priorities in each watershed.\nThe recommendations of Watershed Advisory Committees shall be considered during the preparation\nof each Stormwater Master Plan”; Section 5.0506, providing that construction projects “shall involve\nMember Community and Watershed Advisory input”; and Section 5.0508, requiring that member\ncommunities provide the district with plans for any stormwater management project and requiring that\nthe District will review the plans and “provide and review comments * * *.”\n\f       {¶167} By way of example of the District’s collaboration with the member\n\ncommunities, and their response, in a chart summarizing “Round 1 Meetings” with city\n\nofficials from the member communities, the support was overwhelmingly in favor of the\n\nDistrict managing stormwater runoff issues, including support from some of the appealing\n\ncommunities. Under the comments from a February 2008 meeting with officials from\n\none of the appealing communities, Bedford Heights, it was noted that the city was\n\n“[s]upportive, see[s] the need” and from an October 2007 meeting with officials from\n\nBrecksville, it was noted “[s]upportive.       They see District can help them work with their\n\nneighboring communities, and with [the] Turnpike Commission.”18\n\n       {¶168} Moreover, Section 5.0107 of            Title V provides: “[n]othing in this Title\n\nshall be construed to infringe upon or supplant a Member Community’s, or other local\n\ngovernment’s, power and responsibility, however derived, to plan, finance, construct,\n\nmaintain, operate, and regulate the Local Stormwater System within their jurisdiction.”\n\n       {¶169} In light of the above, I would overrule the fourth assignment of error.\n\n                               IV.   The District’s Cross-Appeal\n\n      {¶170} I agree with the majority that an appeal from a judgment with which the\n\nappellant has voluntarily complied generally renders the appeal moot. Sunkin v. Collision\n\n       18\n          To be fair, the same chart noted that some of the appealing communities were opposed.\nFor example, under the comments from a January 2008 meeting with Lyndhurst officials, it was\nnoted: “We don’t need this. No flooding problems except golf course, and we don’t really care\nabout them. You’re 5 years too late.” From a January 2008 meeting with Strongsville officials, it\nwas noted, “[w]e’ll be glad to help out in your ‘study’ but don’t even think about charging a fee. It\nwill drive commercial owners out of our city. We rely on them for taxes, and we’re competing\nagainst Medina County.”\n\fPro, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3771481\"><a href=\"/opinion/4016014/sunkin-v-collision-pro/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65-66, 2007-Ohio-6046, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">880</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Dist.), citing\n\nAm.

But I do\n\nnot share the majority’s concern about the trial court “overstepping” its boundaries to\n\n“draft legislative measures.”\n\n       {¶171} As noted by the majority, the required process for implementing such a\n\nprogram as the one at issue here was for the District to file a petition with the common\n\npleas court for amendment or modification of the plan of operation that originally created\n\nthe District. See R.C. 6119.051. The District followed the process by filing this action.\n\n  The trial court could accept the District’s Program so long as the amendment or\n\nmodification is in keeping with the purposes of R.C. 6119.01. Id.\n\n       {¶172} I believe, subject to the standard below, that after hearing and reviewing\n\nthe voluminous testimony and exhibits presented during the bench trial, the trial court was\n\nwithin its authority to make amendments or modifications to the District’s Program that\n\nwere in line with the purposes of R.C. Chapter 6119.19\n\n       {¶173} I would review the trial court’s modifications, therefore, like I would\n\nreview any trial court judgment in a civil case; that is, to determine whether it is against\n\nthe manifest weight of the evidence.

I disagree.\n\n       {¶175} The District calculated the stormwater fee for each property using an\n\n“equivalent residential unit.”   Each unit represents 3,000 square feet of impervious\n\nsurface.   Under the District’s initial plan, non-residential property owners were to be\n\ncharged in multiples of the “equivalent residential unit,” while residential property\n\nowners’ “equivalent residential units” were established in three tiers.\n\n       {¶176} The District describes the fee as being based on “all impervious surfaces\n\nwithin the District’s service area * * *” (Title V, Section 5.0223) “based on the\n\nincremental increase in the demand on the Regional Stormwater System caused by\n\ndevelopment on parcels of land.” (District’s Answer Brief, p. 11).\n\n       {¶177} I agree with the trial court that there was no rational basis for charging\n\nnonresidential property owners based on the exact amount of impervious surfaces on their\n\nproperty, while fluctuating the charge for residential property owners.   The “incremental\n\nincrease in demand” is not affected by whether the property owner uses the property for\n\fresidential or commercial purposes and, thus, there was no rational basis for treating the\n\ntwo groups differently.\n\n       {¶178} In light of the above, I would overrule the first assignment of error.\n\nStormwater Education Credit\n\n       {¶179} Under Title V, schools within the District that provide “approved\n\nstormwater pollution prevent curricula to their students that meet and maintain at least the\n\nminimum requirements of the Stormwater Fee Credit Policy Manual may receive a\n\nStormwater Fee Credit * * *.”    (Italics added; underscore sic.) Id. at Section 5.0804(c).\n\n       {¶180} The trial court found that the credit was a “rational way to advance a\n\nlegitimate governmental interest,” but required the District to provide the curriculum.\n\nThe District contends in its second assignment of error that the trial court had no legal\n\nbasis for such an order.    In light of the fact that the credit may only be earned by\n\nproviding approved curricula that are compliant with the District’s policy manual, I would\n\nfind that the court’s order was legally sound.\n\n       {¶181} I would overrule the District’s second assignment of error.\n\nAccrediting Costs for Licensed Engineers\n\n       {¶182} For its third assignment of error, the District contends that the trial court\n\nhad no legal basis for requiring it to come up with a formula for accrediting the costs of\n\nlicensed engineers for completing any applications for credit.   According to the District,\n\n“reimbursing engineering costs was not factored into the District’s plan for the Program\n\nand projected revenue requirements.”\n\f       {¶183} I would find the trial court acted legally in requiring the accreditation, and\n\nlimited it so that it would not be a financial burden to the District and thus\n\ncounterproductive to its Program.     Specifically, the trial court ordered that an engineer’s\n\ncredit cannot exceed 10 percent of the stormwater fee and the credit will only be available\n\nto nonresidential property owners, including school districts.\n\nIncrease in the Community Cost Share\n\n       {¶184} Under the “Community Cost-Share Program” in Title V, the District “shall\n\nform a financial account * * * that shall be for the aggregation and dissemination of funds\n\nderived from revenues collected from the Stormwater Fee and whose purpose is to\n\nprovide funding to assist in Member-Community-requested and District-approved\n\nprojects.”   Title V, Section 5.0901.     The title initially required that at least 7.5 percent\n\nof the “total annual revenue collected in each Member Community shall be allocated to\n\nthat Member Community * * *.” Id. at Section 5.0903(a).\n\n       {¶185} In its February 2012 opinion, the trial court found that because “as much of\n\n78 percent of the watershed may be outside of District control,” the minimum 7.5 percent\n\ncost share was “unfair to member communities because many flooding problems are in\n\nareas that drain far less than 300 acres,20 and the communities are in need of additional\n\nfunds to deal with these local stormwater issues.”     The trial court ordered that\n\n\n\n\n         “Regional Stormwater System” is defined under Title V, in part, to include “watercourses,\n        20\n\nstormwater conveyance structures, and stormwater control measures receiving drainage from three\nhundred (300) acres of land or more.” Id. at Section 5.9218.\n\f       [e]ither the meaning of ‘regional’ must be arrived at by means of a\n       consensus of the District and its member communities or cost share must\n       reflect an amount no less than 25 percent to member communities for local\n       stormwater projects.\n\n       {¶186} I would find that the trial court’s increase was legally sound. Sufficient\n\nevidence was presented demonstrating that the District’s original 7.5 percent cost share\n\nwas inadequate to address the problems that the District hopes to solve.\n\n                                      V. Conclusion\n\n       {¶187} I believe Title V was authorized under both the District’s Charter and Ohio\n\nLaw.   As such, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision to the contrary.\n\nFurther, I also believe the trial court acted legally in making modifications to the Title.\n\nAs such, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s “concerns” in that regard.\n\n       {¶188} I concur with the majority’s judgment affirming the denial of appellants’\n\nmotion to dismiss based on failure to join all property owners. I also concur with the\n\nmajority’s judgment affirming the trial court’s jurisdiction to make post-trial\n\namendments.\n\n       {¶189} In light of the above, I would overrule all the assignments of errors\n\npresented in both the appellants’ appeal and the appellees’ cross-appeal and affirm the\n\ntrial court’s judgments in toto.\n\f</pre>",
