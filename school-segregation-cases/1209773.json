WELLES, JUDGE\n\f                                OPINION\n\n      The Defendant, Franklin W. Campbell, appeals as of right p ursua nt to R ule\n\n3 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure. He pleaded guilty to one\n\ncoun t of sim ple robbery and was se ntence d as a sta ndard, R ange I o ffender to\n\nsix years of incarceration.   The trial cou rt denied probatio n and c omm unity\n\ncorrections. The Defendant now appeals his sentence and argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred by sentencing him to the maximum sentence and for denying him an\n\nalternative to incarceration. We affirm the judgment of the trial court ordering the\n\nDefendant to serve his sentence in confinement but m odify the length of the\n\nsentence to five years.\n\n\n\n      In Septem ber of 19 95, the D efenda nt beca me ac quainte d with Christina\n\nMarie Gribbin, who he knew was a prostitute. The Defendant allowed Gribbin to\n\nstay at his apartment with him. The Defendant is a transsexual and dresses as\n\na woma n. Gribb in aske d the D efend ant on occa sions to acc omp any he r while\n\nshe worked, and he had sat in the car while she went inside a man’s house on\n\nat least one occasion. On September 18, 1995, Gribbin asked the Defe ndant to\n\nride in her car with her while she went to get some money. The Defendant\n\ndenied that he knew that she intended to co mmit a rob bery.\n\n\n\n      The Defendant was drinking alcohol and using Valium that day. He rode\n\nwith Gribbin to an ATM in Madison, Tennessee. Patricia Cam pbell, th e victim in\n\nthis case, withdrew cash from the machine and then drove four miles to the\n\nChestnut Villa Ap artme nts on Due W est Av enue . Gribb in and the Defendant first\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fobserved the victim at the ATM, then followed her to the apartment complex. The\n\nvictim’s three grandchildren, ages four, five, and six, we re with he r. Gribbin got\n\nout of her vehicle, went to the victim as she exited her car, and held a knife to her\n\nthroat. Gribbin said: “Give me your purse or I will kill you.” The Defendant was\n\nyelling from Gribbin’s car, “Hurry up!” Gribbin grabbed the victim’s purse and fled\n\nin her vehic le, a mar oon Fo rd Esco rt. The v ictim st ated th at the p asse nger in the\n\nvehicle was a white female.\n\n\n\n       The police were ca lled and a des cription of the robbe rs was broadca st.\n\nShortly thereafter, Gribbin and the Defendant were apprehended in a maroon\n\nEscort at Ga llatin Ro ad an d Stra tford A venue . The o fficers fo und th e victim ’s\n\npurse sitting on the Defendant’s lap, and found the knife used in the robbery and\n\nthe victim’s ATM card under the driver’s seat. The victim identified Gribbin and\n\nthe De fendan t as the pe rsons w ho had robbed her.\n\n\n\n       Gribb in and the Defendant were charged with aggravated robbery, and the\n\nDefendant plead ed gu ilty to sim ple robbery. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-402;\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-40 1. The trial judge se ntenced him to six years\n\nimprison ment. After conducting a hearing on August 1, 1996, the trial judge\n\ndenied the Defendant’s request to s erve h is sent ence on pro bation or in\n\ncomm unity corrections. The D efenda nt now a ppeals , contend ing that the length\n\nof his sen tence is exce ssive a nd tha t the trial c ourt erred by denying probation\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\for com mun ity corrections. Although these issues may be somewhat moot, we\n\nnonetheless consider them on the merits.1\n\n\n\n        When an accused challenges the length, range, or the manner of service\n\nof a senten ce, this cou rt has a du ty to conduct a de novo review of the sentence\n\nwith a presumption that the determinations made by the trial cou rt are corre ct.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-401(d). This presumption is \"conditioned upon the\n\naffirmative showing in the record that the trial court considered the sentencing\n\nprinciples and all relevant facts and circums tances .\" State v. Ashby, 823 S.W.2d\n\n166, 16 9 (Ten n. 1991 ).\n\n\n\n        In conducting a de novo review of a sentence, this court must consider: (a)\n\nthe eviden ce, if an y, rece ived at th e trial and the sentencing hearing; (b) the\n\npresentence report; (c) the principles o f sentenc ing and argum ents as to\n\nsentencing alternatives; (d) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct\n\ninvolved; (e) any statu tory mitigatin g or enh ancem ent factors ; (f) any statement\n\nthat the defen dant made on his own behalf; and (g) the potential or lack of\n\npotential for rehab ilitation or treatm ent. Ten n. Cod e Ann. §§ 40-35-102, -103,\n\nand -21 0; see State v. S mith, 735 S.W .2d 859, 863 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1987 ).\n\n\n\n        If our review reflects that the trial court followed the statutory sentencing\n\nprocedure, imposed a lawful sentence after having given due consideration and\n\nproper weight to the factors and principals set out under the sentencing law, and\n\n\n1\n We note that the Defendant received pre-sentence jail credit and was incarcerated during the\ninitial pendency of this appeal. According to Department of Correction records the Defendant was\nparoled on October 24, 1997. The Department’s records further reflect that a parole violation\nwarrant was issued on November 10, 1997, and was served on the Defendant on February 20,\n1998.\n\n                                                -4-\n\fthat the trial court's findings of fact are adequately supported by the record, then\n\nwe may not m odify the sentence even if we would have preferred a different\n\nresult. State v. Fletcher, 805 S.W .2d 785, 789 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1991 ).\n\n\n\n      W e believe the record is clear that the trial court failed to properly consider\n\nthe statutory se ntencing principles and state them on the record. In imposing the\n\nsentence, the trial court referred to the fact that the Defendant had prior\n\nconvictions, but did not further e laborate his sente ncing de cision oth er than to\n\nstate that to even “think about” putting the Defedant on proba tion wa s “abs olutely\n\nridiculous .” Therefore, we must we conduct a de novo review of the D efend ant’s\n\nsentence. The presentence report reflects that the Defend ant was thirty-five at\n\nthe time of sentencing, divorced, with an eight-year-old daughter. He had not\n\nheld steady employment for the past five years, but had worked as a female\n\nimpersonator on a spora dic basis. He was currently a transsexual and was\n\ntaking female hormones . He stated that he had a prescription drug addiction\n\nthat began when he was a teenager.             He had used Valium, pain pills, and\n\nalcoho l, and bing ed on c ocaine every cou ple of mo nths. He stated that he has\n\nhad drug a nd alc ohol tre atme nt, as w ell as several psychiatric hospitalizations.\n\nThe Defe ndan t’s prior convictions include the unlawful sale of liquor, two DUIs,\n\ndriving without a license, and shoplifting.\n\n\n\n      Patric ia Cam pbell c omp leted a victim im pact s tatem ent in which she stated\n\nthat she has had insomnia, headaches and recurring fear because of the crime.\n\nShe missed twenty days of work. Her grandchildren have continued to ask why\n\nthe crime occurred and have had nightmares about “nanny” being killed. The\n\nvictim received some counseling regarding the offense.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f        Pam ela Warden testified at the sentencing hearing that she would provide\n\nthe Defendant a place to live and allow him to work for her as a housekeeper.\n\nShe had know n the Defen dant for years and stated that he r childre n liked him\n\nwell.   The D efenda nt testified that, at the time of the robbery, he had a recent\n\nbreakup, had only known Gribbin for a few days, and had just been released from\n\na psychiatric hospital the week before. The Defendant testified regarding his se x-\n\nchange process and his concerns about being incarcerated. He stated that he\n\nwas currently in the Davids on Coun ty Criminal Justice Center in the Special\n\nNeeds Facility. He te stified that he could no t go to the g ym for fea r of other\n\ninmates, and tha t two me n nearly fo rced him to perform ora l sex. He denied that\n\nhe knew a bout the robbery in advanc e and s tated that h e felt remorseful about\n\nthe crime.    T he De fendan t admitte d that he fled to Florida when his last\n\nsentencing hearing was sch eduled , but return ed and turned h imself in.           He\n\ninitially denied a prior criminal record, but then admitted he had lied and that he\n\nhad two DUIs.\n\n\n\n        Darw in Mitchell, an emp loyee from a D avidson Co unty correctional facility,\n\ntestified that the Defendant could be housed in the Special Management area.\n\nThe inmates there are locked down for twenty-two hours and are out for two\n\nhours, five days per week. Some cells house two persons, the others hold o nly\n\none. Inmates who request special protection may be housed there. Mitche ll did\n\nnot know of any inmates there who were transsexuals. The Special Needs unit\n\nprovides care for those with m edica l proble ms. T he inm ates a re out o f their cells\n\neight hours a day. Mitchell suggested that the Special Management segregation\n\nunit wou ld be app ropriate for the Defe ndant.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f      The Defenda nt argues that a ppropriate m itigating circum stanc es in th is\n\ncase are (a) That he played a minor role in the commission of the offense; and\n\n(b)that he was under great stress and the influence of drugs and alcohol when\n\nthe crime was c omm itted. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-113(4), (3). We find the\n\nargument for the app lication of factor (3) unconvincing.       As for factor (4), one\n\ncould consider that the Defendant remained in the c ar and did no t actua lly\n\nphysic ally perform the act that constituted the aggravated robbery. However, the\n\nevidence also shows that the Defenda nt yelled “Hurry up!” to his accomplice as\n\nshe robbed the victim. Moreover, when the Defendant was captured, he was\n\nholding the victim’s purse. The circumstances suggest that the Defendant was\n\nintima tely involved with the crime and we cannot conclude that it would be\n\nappropriate to a pply factor (4).\n\n\n\n       The State proposes the application of three enhancement factors: (a) That\n\nthe Defendant has previous history of criminal convictions; (b) that the Defendant\n\npossessed or employed a firearm, explosive device, or other deadly weapon\n\nduring the commission of the offense; and (c) that the Defendant had no\n\nhesitation about committing a crime when the risk to human life was high. Tenn.\n\nCode A nn. § 40-35-1 14(1), (9), (10).\n\n\n\n       The record is clear that the Defendant has had several prior criminal\n\nconvictions. Therefore, the applic ation o f this en hanc eme nt facto r is appropriate.\n\nNext, the State argues that factor (9), that the Defendant employed a weapon\n\nduring the offense, should be applied.          While it is true that a weapon was\n\nemployed by his accomplice during the commission of the offense, there is no\n\nevidence that the “defendant possessed or em ployed” the knife. Tenn. Code\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAnn. § 40-35 -114(9). A s a result, fac tor (9) sho uld not be applied. Finally, the\n\nState contends that factor (10), that the Defendant had no hesitation about\n\ncommitting a crime when the risk to human life was high, may be applie d in this\n\ncase. We agree. Here , the Defenda nt and his coh ort covertly observed, then\n\nfollowed the victim several miles to an apartment complex. In broad daylight, the\n\nDefendant urged on Ms. Gribbin to perpetrate the robbery using a knife, which\n\nshe held to the victim’s thro at. Moreover, the victim’s young grandchildren were\n\npresent and were also at risk of being harmed during the commission of the\n\ncrime. The Defendant was convicted of simple robbery, thus, factor (10) is not\n\nprecluded as being an eleme nt of the offe nse. See State v. Hicks, 868 S.W.2d\n\n729, 73 2 (Ten n. Crim. A pp. 199 3). The refore, facto r (10) ma y be app lied.\n\n\n\n      The sentence range for a Range I offender for robbery, a Clas s C felony,\n\nis three (3) to (6) years. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-101. While we recognize the\n\nseriousness of the offense committed, our de novo review of the record leads us\n\nto conclude that a sentence in the upper end of the range is warranted, but that\n\nthe circumstances do not merit the maximum sentence in the range. From our\n\nde novo review and in consideration of enhancem ent factors (1) and (10), we\n\nmodify th e Defe ndant’s s entenc e to five (5) ye ars.\n\n\n\n      Next, the Defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying probation\n\nor community corrections. Although probation \"must be automatically considered\n\nas a sentencing option for eligible defendants, the defen dant is not au toma tically\n\nentitled to probation as a matter of law.\" Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-303(b) (1990)\n\n(Sentencing Com miss ion Co mm ents). T his Co urt mu st beg in its sentencing\n\ndetermination by reviewing the purposes of sentencing set forth in Tennessee\n\n                                          -8-\n\fCode Annotated section 40-35-102. State v. Davis , 940 S.W.2d 558,559 (Tenn.\n\n1997).\n\n\n\n         If an accused has been convicted of a Class C, D or E felony and\n\nsentenced as an especially mitigated or standard offender, there is a\n\npresumption, rebuttable in nature, that the accused is a favorable candidate for\n\nalternative sentencing unless disqualified by some provision of the Tennessee\n\nCriminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989. Tennessee Code Annotated section\n\n40-35-1 02 provid es in part:\n\n\n\n         (5) In recognition that state prison capacities and the funds to build and\n         main tain them are limited, convicted felons comm itting the most seve re\n         offenses, possessing criminal histories evincing a clear disregard for\n         the laws a nd m orals o f socie ty, and evincing failure of past efforts at\n         rehabilitation shall be given first priority regarding sentencing involving\n         incarceration; and\n\n         (6) A defendant who does not fall within the parameters of subdivision\n         (5) and is an es pecia lly mitigate d or stan dard offe nder co nvicted of a\n         Class C, D o r E felon y is presumed to be a favorable candidate for\n         alternative senten cing options in the absence of evidence to the\n         contrary.\n\n\n         The sentencing proce ss m ust ne cess arily commence with a determination\n\nof whether the accused is entitled to th e bene fit of the pres umptio n. Ashby, 823\n\nS.W.2d at 169. As our supreme court said in Ashby: \"If [the] de termin ation is\n\nfavora ble to the defe ndant, the trial court m ust presu me tha t he is subject to\n\nalternative sentencing.       If the court is presented with evidence sufficient to\n\novercome the presumption, then it may sentence the defendant to confinement\n\naccord ing to the s tatutory pro vision[s].\" Id. \"Evidence to the contrary\" may be\n\nfound in app lying the         cons ideratio ns tha t gover n sen tence s involving\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fconfinem ent, which are set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section\n\n40-35-103 (1):\n\n\n\n       (A) Conf inem ent is n eces sary to protec t socie ty by restraining a\n       defend ant who has a lon g history of c riminal co nduct;\n\n       (B) Confinement is necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of\n       the offense or confinem ent is particularly suited to provid e an effective\n       deterrence to others likely to commit similar offenses; or\n\n       (C) Measures less restrictive than confinement have frequently or\n       recently b een ap plied uns uccess fully to the de fendan t.\n\n\n\n\n       In the case at bar, the De fendan t was convicted of the Class C felony of\n\nrobbery, for which he is presumptively entitled to an alternative sentence.\n\nHoweve r, the record reflects that the trial judge was concerned with the\n\nDefe ndan t’s focus on his problems and a lack of consideration for the victim.\n\nApparen tly, the trial court determ ined that c onfinem ent was neces sary to avoid\n\ndepreciating the seriousness of the offense.\n\n\n\n        The potential or lack of potential for rehab ilitation o f a defe ndan t shou ld\n\nbe considered in determining w hether he sh ould be gran ted an alternative\n\nsentence.    Tenn . Code Ann. § 4 0-35-10 3(5). The record reflects that the\n\nDefendant failed to ap pear at h is first senten cing hea ring beca use he fled to\n\nFlorida. Although he d id return to Tennessee, this behavior would certainly be\n\nsufficient to unde rmine th e trial court’s c onfiden ce in the D efenda nt’s ability to\n\nabide by the term s of an alte rnative se ntence . See State v. Williams, 914 S.W.2d\n\n940, 950 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1995). Although Ms. Warden offered the Defendant\n\na place to work and live , the D efend ant ha s had an un stable work history in the\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fpast and has had a long history of drug abuse and psychiatric problems that have\n\nnot abated with treatment. Fina lly, the Defendant demonstrated a lack of candor\n\nwhile testifying at the sentencing hearing. The Defendant's lack of credibility and\n\nunwillingness to accept respons ibility for his crime reflect a dvers ely on h is\n\nrehab ilitation p otentia l. See State v. Zeolia , 928 S.W.2d 457, 463 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996); State v. Dowdy, 894 S.W.2d 301, 306 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994). In\n\nlight of the evidence in the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred\n\nby orderin g the De fendan t to serve his senten ce in con fineme nt.\n\n\n\n      The Community Corrections A ct allows ce rtain eligible o ffenders to\n\nparticip ate in community-based alternatives to incarceration. Tenn. Code Ann.\n\n§ 40-36-103 . A defendan t must first be a suitable candidate for alternative\n\nsentencing. If so, a defendant is then eligible for participation in a community\n\ncorrections program if he also satisfies several minimum eligibility criteria set\n\nforth at Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-36-106(a).                 Because the\n\nDefendant has failed to establish tha t he is a qualified cand idate for alternative\n\nsentencing, he is not eligible for community corrections.\n\n\n\n      According ly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court ordering the\n\nDefendant to serve his sentence in confineme nt, but modify the se ntence to five\n\nyears.

WELLES, JUDGE\n\f                                OPINION\n\n      The Defendant, Franklin W. Campbell, appeals as of right p ursua nt to R ule\n\n3 of the Tennessee Rules of Appellate Procedure. He pleaded guilty to one\n\ncoun t of sim ple robbery and was se ntence d as a sta ndard, R ange I o ffender to\n\nsix years of incarceration.   The trial cou rt denied probatio n and c omm unity\n\ncorrections. The Defendant now appeals his sentence and argues that the trial\n\ncourt erred by sentencing him to the maximum sentence and for denying him an\n\nalternative to incarceration. We affirm the judgment of the trial court ordering the\n\nDefendant to serve his sentence in confinement but m odify the length of the\n\nsentence to five years.\n\n\n\n      In Septem ber of 19 95, the D efenda nt beca me ac quainte d with Christina\n\nMarie Gribbin, who he knew was a prostitute. The Defendant allowed Gribbin to\n\nstay at his apartment with him. The Defendant is a transsexual and dresses as\n\na woma n. Gribb in aske d the D efend ant on occa sions to acc omp any he r while\n\nshe worked, and he had sat in the car while she went inside a man’s house on\n\nat least one occasion. On September 18, 1995, Gribbin asked the Defe ndant to\n\nride in her car with her while she went to get some money. The Defendant\n\ndenied that he knew that she intended to co mmit a rob bery.\n\n\n\n      The Defendant was drinking alcohol and using Valium that day. He rode\n\nwith Gribbin to an ATM in Madison, Tennessee. Patricia Cam pbell, th e victim in\n\nthis case, withdrew cash from the machine and then drove four miles to the\n\nChestnut Villa Ap artme nts on Due W est Av enue . Gribb in and the Defendant first\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fobserved the victim at the ATM, then followed her to the apartment complex. The\n\nvictim’s three grandchildren, ages four, five, and six, we re with he r. Gribbin got\n\nout of her vehicle, went to the victim as she exited her car, and held a knife to her\n\nthroat. Gribbin said: “Give me your purse or I will kill you.” The Defendant was\n\nyelling from Gribbin’s car, “Hurry up!” Gribbin grabbed the victim’s purse and fled\n\nin her vehic le, a mar oon Fo rd Esco rt. The v ictim st ated th at the p asse nger in the\n\nvehicle was a white female.\n\n\n\n       The police were ca lled and a des cription of the robbe rs was broadca st.\n\nShortly thereafter, Gribbin and the Defendant were apprehended in a maroon\n\nEscort at Ga llatin Ro ad an d Stra tford A venue . The o fficers fo und th e victim ’s\n\npurse sitting on the Defendant’s lap, and found the knife used in the robbery and\n\nthe victim’s ATM card under the driver’s seat. The victim identified Gribbin and\n\nthe De fendan t as the pe rsons w ho had robbed her.\n\n\n\n       Gribb in and the Defendant were charged with aggravated robbery, and the\n\nDefendant plead ed gu ilty to sim ple robbery. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-402;\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-40 1. The trial judge se ntenced him to six years\n\nimprison ment. After conducting a hearing on August 1, 1996, the trial judge\n\ndenied the Defendant’s request to s erve h is sent ence on pro bation or in\n\ncomm unity corrections. The D efenda nt now a ppeals , contend ing that the length\n\nof his sen tence is exce ssive a nd tha t the trial c ourt erred by denying probation\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\for com mun ity corrections. Although these issues may be somewhat moot, we\n\nnonetheless consider them on the merits.1\n\n\n\n        When an accused challenges the length, range, or the manner of service\n\nof a senten ce, this cou rt has a du ty to conduct a de novo review of the sentence\n\nwith a presumption that the determinations made by the trial cou rt are corre ct.\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-401(d). This presumption is \"conditioned upon the\n\naffirmative showing in the record that the trial court considered the sentencing\n\nprinciples and all relevant facts and circums tances .\" State v. Ashby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1740283\"><a href=\"/opinion/1740283/state-v-ashby/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 9 (Ten n. 1991 ).\n\n\n\n        In conducting a de novo review of a sentence, this court must consider: (a)\n\nthe eviden ce, if an y, rece ived at th e trial and the sentencing hearing; (b) the\n\npresentence report; (c) the principles o f sentenc ing and argum ents as to\n\nsentencing alternatives; (d) the nature and characteristics of the criminal conduct\n\ninvolved; (e) any statu tory mitigatin g or enh ancem ent factors ; (f) any statement\n\nthat the defen dant made on his own behalf; and (g) the potential or lack of\n\npotential for rehab ilitation or treatm ent. Ten n. Cod e Ann. §§ 40-35-102, -103,\n\nand -21 0; see State v. S mith, 735 S.W .2d 859, 863 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1987 ).\n\n\n\n        If our review reflects that the trial court followed the statutory sentencing\n\nprocedure, imposed a lawful sentence after having given due consideration and\n\nproper weight to the factors and principals set out under the sentencing law, and\n\n\n1\n We note that the Defendant received pre-sentence jail credit and was incarcerated during the\ninitial pendency of this appeal. According to Department of Correction records the Defendant was\nparoled on October 24, 1997. The Department’s records further reflect that a parole violation\nwarrant was issued on November 10, 1997, and was served on the Defendant on February 20,\n1998.\n\n                                                -4-\n\fthat the trial court's findings of fact are adequately supported by the record, then\n\nwe may not m odify the sentence even if we would have preferred a different\n\nresult. State v. Fletcher, 805 S.W .2d 785, 789 (Tenn. Crim . App. 1991 ).\n\n\n\n      W e believe the record is clear that the trial court failed to properly consider\n\nthe statutory se ntencing principles and state them on the record. In imposing the\n\nsentence, the trial court referred to the fact that the Defendant had prior\n\nconvictions, but did not further e laborate his sente ncing de cision oth er than to\n\nstate that to even “think about” putting the Defedant on proba tion wa s “abs olutely\n\nridiculous .” Therefore, we must we conduct a de novo review of the D efend ant’s\n\nsentence. The presentence report reflects that the Defend ant was thirty-five at\n\nthe time of sentencing, divorced, with an eight-year-old daughter. He had not\n\nheld steady employment for the past five years, but had worked as a female\n\nimpersonator on a spora dic basis. He was currently a transsexual and was\n\ntaking female hormones . He stated that he had a prescription drug addiction\n\nthat began when he was a teenager.             He had used Valium, pain pills, and\n\nalcoho l, and bing ed on c ocaine every cou ple of mo nths. He stated that he has\n\nhad drug a nd alc ohol tre atme nt, as w ell as several psychiatric hospitalizations.\n\nThe Defe ndan t’s prior convictions include the unlawful sale of liquor, two DUIs,\n\ndriving without a license, and shoplifting.\n\n\n\n      Patric ia Cam pbell c omp leted a victim im pact s tatem ent in which she stated\n\nthat she has had insomnia, headaches and recurring fear because of the crime.\n\nShe missed twenty days of work. Her grandchildren have continued to ask why\n\nthe crime occurred and have had nightmares about “nanny” being killed. The\n\nvictim received some counseling regarding the offense.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f        Pam ela Warden testified at the sentencing hearing that she would provide\n\nthe Defendant a place to live and allow him to work for her as a housekeeper.\n\nShe had know n the Defen dant for years and stated that he r childre n liked him\n\nwell.   The D efenda nt testified that, at the time of the robbery, he had a recent\n\nbreakup, had only known Gribbin for a few days, and had just been released from\n\na psychiatric hospital the week before. The Defendant testified regarding his se x-\n\nchange process and his concerns about being incarcerated. He stated that he\n\nwas currently in the Davids on Coun ty Criminal Justice Center in the Special\n\nNeeds Facility. He te stified that he could no t go to the g ym for fea r of other\n\ninmates, and tha t two me n nearly fo rced him to perform ora l sex. He denied that\n\nhe knew a bout the robbery in advanc e and s tated that h e felt remorseful about\n\nthe crime.    T he De fendan t admitte d that he fled to Florida when his last\n\nsentencing hearing was sch eduled , but return ed and turned h imself in.           He\n\ninitially denied a prior criminal record, but then admitted he had lied and that he\n\nhad two DUIs.\n\n\n\n        Darw in Mitchell, an emp loyee from a D avidson Co unty correctional facility,\n\ntestified that the Defendant could be housed in the Special Management area.\n\nThe inmates there are locked down for twenty-two hours and are out for two\n\nhours, five days per week. Some cells house two persons, the others hold o nly\n\none. Inmates who request special protection may be housed there. Mitche ll did\n\nnot know of any inmates there who were transsexuals. The Special Needs unit\n\nprovides care for those with m edica l proble ms. T he inm ates a re out o f their cells\n\neight hours a day. Mitchell suggested that the Special Management segregation\n\nunit wou ld be app ropriate for the Defe ndant.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f      The Defenda nt argues that a ppropriate m itigating circum stanc es in th is\n\ncase are (a) That he played a minor role in the commission of the offense; and\n\n(b)that he was under great stress and the influence of drugs and alcohol when\n\nthe crime was c omm itted. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-113(4), (3). We find the\n\nargument for the app lication of factor (3) unconvincing.       As for factor (4), one\n\ncould consider that the Defendant remained in the c ar and did no t actua lly\n\nphysic ally perform the act that constituted the aggravated robbery. However, the\n\nevidence also shows that the Defenda nt yelled “Hurry up!” to his accomplice as\n\nshe robbed the victim. Moreover, when the Defendant was captured, he was\n\nholding the victim’s purse. The circumstances suggest that the Defendant was\n\nintima tely involved with the crime and we cannot conclude that it would be\n\nappropriate to a pply factor (4).\n\n\n\n       The State proposes the application of three enhancement factors: (a) That\n\nthe Defendant has previous history of criminal convictions; (b) that the Defendant\n\npossessed or employed a firearm, explosive device, or other deadly weapon\n\nduring the commission of the offense; and (c) that the Defendant had no\n\nhesitation about committing a crime when the risk to human life was high. Tenn.\n\nCode A nn. § 40-35-1 14(1), (9), (10).\n\n\n\n       The record is clear that the Defendant has had several prior criminal\n\nconvictions. Therefore, the applic ation o f this en hanc eme nt facto r is appropriate.\n\nNext, the State argues that factor (9), that the Defendant employed a weapon\n\nduring the offense, should be applied.          While it is true that a weapon was\n\nemployed by his accomplice during the commission of the offense, there is no\n\nevidence that the “defendant possessed or em ployed” the knife. Tenn. Code\n\n                                          -7-\n\fAnn. § 40-35 -114(9). A s a result, fac tor (9) sho uld not be applied. Finally, the\n\nState contends that factor (10), that the Defendant had no hesitation about\n\ncommitting a crime when the risk to human life was high, may be applie d in this\n\ncase. We agree. Here , the Defenda nt and his coh ort covertly observed, then\n\nfollowed the victim several miles to an apartment complex. In broad daylight, the\n\nDefendant urged on Ms. Gribbin to perpetrate the robbery using a knife, which\n\nshe held to the victim’s thro at. Moreover, the victim’s young grandchildren were\n\npresent and were also at risk of being harmed during the commission of the\n\ncrime. The Defendant was convicted of simple robbery, thus, factor (10) is not\n\nprecluded as being an eleme nt of the offe nse. See State v. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1728854\"><a href=\"/opinion/1728854/state-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 2 (Ten n. Crim. A pp. 199 3). The refore, facto r (10) ma y be app lied.\n\n\n\n      The sentence range for a Range I offender for robbery, a Clas s C felony,\n\nis three (3) to (6) years. Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-101. While we recognize the\n\nseriousness of the offense committed, our de novo review of the record leads us\n\nto conclude that a sentence in the upper end of the range is warranted, but that\n\nthe circumstances do not merit the maximum sentence in the range. From our\n\nde novo review and in consideration of enhancem ent factors (1) and (10), we\n\nmodify th e Defe ndant’s s entenc e to five (5) ye ars.\n\n\n\n      Next, the Defendant argues that the trial court erred by denying probation\n\nor community corrections. Although probation \"must be automatically considered\n\nas a sentencing option for eligible defendants, the defen dant is not au toma tically\n\nentitled to probation as a matter of law.\" Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-35-303(b) (1990)\n\n(Sentencing Com miss ion Co mm ents). T his Co urt mu st beg in its sentencing\n\ndetermination by reviewing the purposes of sentencing set forth in Tennessee\n\n                                          -8-\n\fCode Annotated section 40-35-102. State v. Davis , 940 S.W.2d 558,559 (Tenn.\n\n1997).\n\n\n\n         If an accused has been convicted of a Class C, D or E felony and\n\nsentenced as an especially mitigated or standard offender, there is a\n\npresumption, rebuttable in nature, that the accused is a favorable candidate for\n\nalternative sentencing unless disqualified by some provision of the Tennessee\n\nCriminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989. Tennessee Code Annotated section\n\n40-35-1 02 provid es in part:\n\n\n\n         (5) In recognition that state prison capacities and the funds to build and\n         main tain them are limited, convicted felons comm itting the most seve re\n         offenses, possessing criminal histories evincing a clear disregard for\n         the laws a nd m orals o f socie ty, and evincing failure of past efforts at\n         rehabilitation shall be given first priority regarding sentencing involving\n         incarceration; and\n\n         (6) A defendant who does not fall within the parameters of subdivision\n         (5) and is an es pecia lly mitigate d or stan dard offe nder co nvicted of a\n         Class C, D o r E felon y is presumed to be a favorable candidate for\n         alternative senten cing options in the absence of evidence to the\n         contrary.\n\n\n         The sentencing proce ss m ust ne cess arily commence with a determination\n\nof whether the accused is entitled to th e bene fit of the pres umptio n. Ashby, 823\n\nS.W.2d at 169. As our supreme court said in Ashby: \"If [the] de termin ation is\n\nfavora ble to the defe ndant, the trial court m ust presu me tha t he is subject to\n\nalternative sentencing.       If the court is presented with evidence sufficient to\n\novercome the presumption, then it may sentence the defendant to confinement\n\naccord ing to the s tatutory pro vision[s].\" Id. \"Evidence to the contrary\" may be\n\nfound in app lying the         cons ideratio ns tha t gover n sen tence s involving\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\fconfinem ent, which are set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section\n\n40-35-103 (1):\n\n\n\n       (A) Conf inem ent is n eces sary to protec t socie ty by restraining a\n       defend ant who has a lon g history of c riminal co nduct;\n\n       (B) Confinement is necessary to avoid depreciating the seriousness of\n       the offense or confinem ent is particularly suited to provid e an effective\n       deterrence to others likely to commit similar offenses; or\n\n       (C) Measures less restrictive than confinement have frequently or\n       recently b een ap plied uns uccess fully to the de fendan t.\n\n\n\n\n       In the case at bar, the De fendan t was convicted of the Class C felony of\n\nrobbery, for which he is presumptively entitled to an alternative sentence.\n\nHoweve r, the record reflects that the trial judge was concerned with the\n\nDefe ndan t’s focus on his problems and a lack of consideration for the victim.\n\nApparen tly, the trial court determ ined that c onfinem ent was neces sary to avoid\n\ndepreciating the seriousness of the offense.\n\n\n\n        The potential or lack of potential for rehab ilitation o f a defe ndan t shou ld\n\nbe considered in determining w hether he sh ould be gran ted an alternative\n\nsentence.    Tenn . Code Ann. § 4 0-35-10 3(5). The record reflects that the\n\nDefendant failed to ap pear at h is first senten cing hea ring beca use he fled to\n\nFlorida. Although he d id return to Tennessee, this behavior would certainly be\n\nsufficient to unde rmine th e trial court’s c onfiden ce in the D efenda nt’s ability to\n\nabide by the term s of an alte rnative se ntence .

Because the\n\nDefendant has failed to establish tha t he is a qualified cand idate for alternative\n\nsentencing, he is not eligible for community corrections.\n\n\n\n      According ly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court ordering the\n\nDefendant to serve his sentence in confineme nt, but modify the se ntence to five\n\nyears. This case is remanded to the trial court for entry of an order consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 ____________________________________\n                                 DAVID H.
