Id.\n\fwoman married to a black man, Orlando Robinson (Orlando).1 KaRon represented\n\nherself at trial. The jury returned a verdict in her favor on claims of disparate treatment,\n\nretaliation and hostile work environment. Cavalry appeals from the district court’s denial\n\nof its motion for a directed verdict on KaRon’s claims and, in the alternative, the denial\n\nof Cavalry’s post-trial request for a new trial based on KaRon’s conduct during her self-\n\nrepresentation. KaRon cross-appeals from the district court’s grant of a directed verdict\n\nto Cavalry on her constructive discharge and punitive damages claims. We reverse and\n\nremand for the district court to enter a directed verdict for Cavalry on KaRon’s\n\ndiscrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment claims.\n\n                           I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n\n       Orlando and KaRon both worked at the Cavalry office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nOrlando began working at Cavalry in December, 2003. He recruited his wife to apply for\n\na job and she began her employment with Cavalry on July 26, 2004.\n\nA.     Cavalry’s Business Operations and Payment Structure.\n\n       Cavalry is a debt collection service agency. Its home office is located in Phoenix,\n\nArizona, with satellite offices in St. Paul, Minnesota and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Collection\n\nspecialists (specialists) such as KaRon are assigned delinquent accounts to try to collect.\n\nThe original distribution of accounts is automatically sent to the individual specialist’s\n\nqueue by the portfolio managers in the Phoenix office, usually within the first ten days of\n\n\n\n       1\n           We use the Robinsons’ first names for clarity and ease of expression.\n       2\n           These facts were not contested at trial.\n\fthe month.3 On the collection floor, specialists are placed in “teams” under one manager\n\nwho, in turn, reports to a manager/director. If a specialist does not receive an adequate\n\namount of accounts, it is the manager’s responsibility to go to a director to ask that\n\nPhoenix be notified of the situation. Managers do not work individual accounts, but\n\nreceive commissions based on the collections of the people on their team. Some\n\nspecialists who work “manual” accounts (meaning the specialist manually dials the phone\n\nrather than having a computer automatically dial their next account) have access to a\n\ncomputer program, called “skip tools,” to research and correct debtors’ invalid telephone\n\nnumbers or addresses.\n\n       Collection accounts differed in the amount owed and in the difficulty in\n\nsuccessfully negotiating repayment. During a new employee’s training, Cavalry\n\n“[g]enerally . . . focused on the newer people working smaller balanced accounts\n\n[approximately $500.00] . . . [because] the [training specialists] didn’t have skip tools.”\n\n(Vol. II at 652.) Specialists could accept several forms of payment from the debtors.\n\nOne form was post-dated checks. Another was an Automatic Clearinghouse payment (an\n\nACH). This is an agreement from a customer to automatically pay monthly from his or\n\nher bank account. The advantage for the customer is he or she pays no interest. The\n\nbenefit for the collection specialist is the monthly payment goes toward his or her\n\ncommission every month without having to follow up with the customer.\n\n\n       3\n          There was some testimony that, at one time, Tulsa management had control of\nthe distribution of accounts to its office. However, there was no testimony that this\ncontrol was in effect during KaRon’s employment.\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f       Specialists could also “exhaust” an account because it was uncollectible. The\n\nspecialist’s computer screen allowed them to designate one of three different reasons to\n\nexhaust: unable to locate a customer after a diligent search; customer unable to pay; and\n\nthe customer’s absolute refusal to pay. When an account is exhausted, the collector\n\npresses a button on the computer and the account is forwarded to the collector’s\n\nmanager’s queue to either be sent on as uncollectible or, if the specialist is exhausting too\n\nmany accounts, sent back to the specialist for them to try contacting the debtor again.\n\n       A major potential source of income for a collections specialist is the commission\n\nreceived on paying accounts. The commission percentage is based on a scoring formula\n\nderived from different factors relating to a debtor’s propensity to pay on the account and\n\nthe availability of state laws to enforce collections. The Phoenix office assigns a higher\n\ncommission rate on more difficult accounts. For example, if the debtor was located in a\n\nstate where the laws were not favorable to suit, the commission rate would be higher. If\n\nthe specialist discovered the current address of the debtor had changed to a different state\n\nwith a lower rating factor, the commission would be changed as well. The commission\n\nfor each payment was applied to the specialist’s monthly goal – an amount calculated\n\nfrom the specialist’s pay rate and the number of hours worked each month. As a\n\nspecialist’s negotiated payments reached incremental levels approaching her goal, such as\n\n50%, 75% and 100%, she would receive increasing bonus payments.\n\nB.     KaRon Robinson’s Employment\n\n       1.     Academy Bay\n\n       At the time KaRon was employed, all new employees were assigned to work in\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fthe training unit known as Academy Bay, an experimental training program initiated in\n\nMay or June 2004. Upon completion of certain criteria, an employee would “graduate”\n\nto the floor and receive an assignment to a collection team. Rhonda Bemore was the\n\nmanager of Academy Bay and the direct supervisor of approximately twenty new\n\nemployees. Bemore’s supervisors were Andrew Brown, Vice-President of Tulsa\n\noperations, Mickey Warren (title unknown) and Mike Madewell, Site Manager and “for a\n\nperiod of time,” Academy Bay Director. (Vol. II at 769.) Madewell determined who\n\nwould graduate to the floor with input from Brown and Bemore. While in Academy Bay,\n\nKaRon complained to Brown about Bemore’s supervision claiming “she was a little more\n\nstrict or a little more harsh than she should be, that she didn’t get [KaRon’s] letters done\n\nvery efficiently, [and] that she didn’t answer [KaRon’s] questions in a professional\n\nmanner.” (Id. at 638.)\n\n       2.     Racial Incident\n\n       On October 21, 2004, Kim Cooper, a Cavalry employee in Academy Bay,\n\napproached Bemore to report an incident in the lunch room regarding race. Bemore\n\nasked who was involved and Cooper named KaRon and Mark Torres. Bemore relayed\n\nthe report to Madewell who summoned KaRon and Torres for interviews and to give\n\nwritten statements. Madewell spoke with KaRon first. She wrote the following\n\nstatement:\n\n       Mark and I were having lunch and Mark politely asked me if I only dated\n       black guys like Mariza did. I told him no I was attracted to both I just\n       happened to end up [with] one of a different race. He responded [with] the\n       fact that he would never date someone of another race, he just couldn’t\n       stand having to listen to them complain about the whole slavery topics. He\n\n                                                -5-\n\f      thought they used it as a crutch. Mark continued to express that he’s not a\n      racist that he just didn’t really like blacks until he got to know them.\n      Which is fine however there were several times he used the word “Nigger”\n      while referring to them. He explained that he just didn’t like the fact that\n      they can call each other by that word but he can’t call them that. I’m pretty\n      sure he wasn’t using the term neg[atively] he was just using the term to\n      describe a certain situation. However there were several people in the\n      breakroom and I’m sure they over-heard him using the term. I did [talk to]\n      him outside after lunch bec[ause] I was offended and Mark explained to me\n      that he was using the word to explain himself in that situation but he wasn’t\n      calling anyone here that. He apologized to me for even using the term and I\n      explained to him that I understood if he felt that however work is not the\n      place to discuss it. He had also made a comment that he didn’t have black\n      in his bloodline because if he did he would be scraping that sh_t off. I told\n      him that was a very racist thing to say and once again he cont[inued] to\n      explain that he has black friends, and he’s not a racist.\n\n(Vol. IV at 1589-90.)\n\n      Torres was interviewed next. He wrote in relevant part:\n\n      First of all I have to say that I am naturally a jokster [sic] and I am always\n      joking around with people, this is just who I am. Jokingly I [said] to\n      KaRon “if you leave your husband are you going to find you a good\n      looking white guy.” Obviously, I guess she got offended by me saying that\n      and she said kind of inquizitively [sic] “Are you prejudiced?” I said “No\n      of course not, I was just curious.”\n\n      Then me being the jokster [sic] that I am trying to be funny I was asking\n      my buddy Adam “why is it the black guys in my team can say “whats up\n      my nigga” to each other but if we said it we would get hurt.” I was just\n      giving my opinion in a funny way but because the N word was used, even\n      thought it was not directed at anyone, and even though if I happened to be\n      black I would not be writing this right now, it should not have been said.\n\n      My Opinion – I want to apolige [sic], but I would also like to say I really\n      don’t think its right that the N-word is [said] almost on a daily basis by\n      some of the black humans that work at this site. But because I [said] this\n      word, even though it was not directed at anyone and I would never direct\n      that word to anyone, that I am sitting here under question because I am not\n      African American. When I hear African Americans say this word daily.\n\n      I want to reiterate the word was not [said] towards anyone it was used in\n      the tense [sic] of asking a question. Thats it thats the bottom. [sic] Why,\n\n                                              -6-\n\f         because Mark Torres says so!\n\n(Id. at 1591-92.)\n\n         After reading Torres’ statement, Madewell also interviewed Adam Aven who\n\nwrote:\n\n         During lunch in the break room (east break room) myself, Mark T. and the\n         young lady were visiting together while we ate. She asked Marc for his\n         opinion [and] or thoughts on a particular subject [and] he proceeded to tell\n         her. Some of his views probably sounded “racial” in nature, but in reality\n         probably weren’t. But the way she perceived them may have offended her.\n\n(R. Vol. IV at 1588). Madewell gave Torres a verbal warning that his conduct would not\n\nbe tolerated and any further similar conduct would lead to disciplinary action, including\n\ntermination. Madewell then delivered the written statements to Vicki Arnold, the on-site\n\nhuman resources representative. In turn, Todd Tipton, director of human resources in\n\nPhoenix, was made aware of the statements.\n\n         Two days later, Torres was terminated for excessive tardiness. Apparently\n\nbelieving his statements to KaRon were at least a partial cause of his lay off, Torres was\n\nwaiting in the parking lot when KaRon and Orlando left work that evening. Torres\n\nshouted insults and threats. The Robinsons were asked to come back inside the building\n\nwhile someone else went outside to tell Torres he must leave or the police would be\n\ncalled. Torres left.\n\n         3.    David Shaw’s Unit\n\n         Academy Bay was discontinued at the end of December 2004 and the specialists\n\nremaining in Academy Bay were assigned to floor units. KaRon was assigned to David\n\nShaw’s unit. While in Shaw’s unit, KaRon complained about the amount of accounts she\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\freceived. The same complaint, however, was voiced by many specialists. She also\n\ninformed Shaw she was having problems with her computer but nothing was done about\n\nit. On April 20, 2005, without explanation, KaRon telephoned to submit her resignation.\n\nOrlando resigned the same day.\n\n       According to KaRon, her resignation was caused by her treatment after the Torres\n\nincident. She claimed Cavalry gave her fewer and less lucrative accounts, had her\n\ncommissions lowered and told her she could not be seen with her husband even though\n\nother couples were free to mingle. She also claimed she was not promoted out of\n\nAcademy Bay when other less competent employees graduated to the floor. She alleged\n\nshe was subject to verbal abuse and inequitable disciplinary measures by her supervisors\n\nand the conditions of her work forced her to resign.4\n\n                      II.     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Pretrial\n\n       KaRon filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on\n\nJune 13, 2005, and on September 28, 2005, she received a notice of right to sue. She\n\nfiled her lawsuit on December 22, 2005, raising three claims: sexual discrimination,\n\nretaliation and hostile work environment pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n       4\n         KaRon’s anger and her intention to sue Cavalry at the time she resigned are not\ndisputed. Before leaving her employment, KaRon copied and retained numerous Cavalry\ndocuments containing client information. During re-direct examination of David Shaw,\nshe asked, “So you don’t think it’s fair that [I] secured the information to show . . .\nmistreatment?” (Vol. II at 739.) On her last day, she transferred 50 to 75 of her accounts\nto the “Spanish bin,” where the accounts would be assigned to a specialist proficient in\nSpanish. In her questions to Shaw, she stated she did this in an attempt to prevent Shaw\nfrom receiving any commission on those accounts.\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., seeking actual, compensatory and punitive damages. At\n\nsome point KaRon abandoned her sexual discrimination claim. The pre-trial order\n\nidentifies the issues as: “1.) race discrimination [based on racial association]; 2.) hostile\n\nwork environment; and 3.) retaliation which ultimately resulted in her constructive\n\ndischarge.” (R. Vol. I at 37.)\n\nB.     Trial\n\n       The jury trial began on April 18, 2007, and continued through April 24, 2007.\n\nKaRon called Bemore, Brown, Madewell and Shaw to testify as hostile witnesses. She\n\nalso called black co-employees Vince Brinkley, who worked with her in Academy Bay,\n\nand Kari Kiger, a co-worker in David Shaw’s unit. In addition, KaRon presented\n\ntestimony from her husband (a manager-in-training) and Gregory Kent Mitchell, another\n\nmanager-in-training.\n\n       After KaRon presented her case, Cavalry moved for judgment as a matter of law\n\non all claims. The district court took the motion under advisement. At the completion of\n\nall evidence, Cavalry renewed its motion. The district court granted a directed verdict to\n\nCavalry on KaRon’s constructive discharge and punitive damages claims, but allowed the\n\njury to determine her discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment claims.\n\nC.     The Verdict and Post-Trial Motions\n\n       The jury returned with a verdict in KaRon’s favor on her discrimination,\n\nretaliation and hostile work environment claims, awarding her $150,001 in compensatory\n\ndamages and $150,000 in back pay. Both parties filed post-trial motions. KaRon\n\nrequested over two million dollars in future damages based on the jury’s finding she was\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fsubject to a hostile work environment which prevented her successful career at Cavalry.\n\nCavalry filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law claiming KaRon failed to\n\nestablish her prima facie case, and even if she did, she failed to show Cavalry’s business\n\nreasons for its actions were pretext. Cavalry also filed a motion for a new trial claiming\n\nKaRon’s emotional outbursts and improper questions tainted the trial’s outcome. The\n\ncourt granted Cavalry’s motion for a new trial solely on the back-pay damages. The\n\nremaining post-trial motions were denied.\n\n       Following a new trial on back-pay damages, the court reduced the jury’s award\n\nfrom $150,000 to $12,141.71 including interest. 5 Cavalry appeals from the denial of its\n\nmotions for either a directed verdict or a new trial. KaRon cross-appeals from the\n\ndirected verdict on constructive discharge (including future damages) and the denial of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n                                  III.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Waiver\n\n       As an initial matter, KaRon maintains Cavalry waived all but one of its arguments\n\non appeal because it failed to raise the other issues when making its pre-verdict motion\n\nfor a directed verdict.6 “To preserve a sufficiency of the evidence claim for appellate\n\nreview, a party must move for judgment as a matter of law (directed verdict) under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) at the close of the evidence . . . . Motions under\n\nRule 50 must ‘specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the\n\n       5\n           KaRon was represented by counsel at the damages trial before the district court.\n       6\n           KaRon does not specify exactly which argument she believes was preserved.\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fmoving party is entitled to the judgment.’” United Int’l Holdings, Inc. v. Wharf\n\n(Holdings) Ltd., 210 F.3d 1207, 1228 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(2)).\n\nRule 50(a) may not be circumvented “by raising for the first time in a post-trial motion\n\nissues not raised in an earlier motion for directed verdict.” Id.\n\n       Cavalry maintains the issues were raised at the proper time but, in any event,\n\nKaRon waived her challenge by failing to raise it in the district court. See Guides, Ltd. v.\n\nYarmouth Group Prop. Mgmt. Inc., 295 F.3d 1065, 1076 n.3 (10th Cir. 2002) (“When the\n\nnon-moving party fails to raise the inadequacy of a Rule 50(a) motion in opposition to a\n\nRule 50(b) motion, that party cannot raise waiver as an argument on appeal.”). Given\n\nKaRon’s waiver of her argument, we consider all issues determined by the district court.\n\nB.     Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n       We review the district court’s denial of a Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. Id. at 1073. We\n\nreview the entire record and construe the evidence with all reasonable inferences in the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party. We do not make credibility determinations\n\nor weigh the evidence. Id. Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate “only if there is no\n\nlegally sufficient evidentiary basis for the claim.” Id.\n\n       “[A] plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the\n\nemployer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the\n\nemployer unlawfully discriminated.” Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, 530 U.S.\n\n133, 148 (2000). “Proof that the defendant’s explanation is unworthy of credence is\n\nsimply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination,\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fand it may be quite persuasive.” Id. at 147; see also St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v.

Certainly there will be\n       instances where, although the plaintiff has established a prima facie case\n       and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no\n       rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.\n\n                                             ****\n\n       Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case\n       will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the\n       plaintiff's prima facie case, the probative value of the proof that the\n       employer’s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the\n       employer’s case and that properly may be considered on a motion for\n       judgment as a matter of law.\n\nReeves, 530 U.S. at 148-49.\n\n       1.       Retaliation\n\n       KaRon claims Cavalry’s discriminatory actions were in retaliation for her report of\n\nthe Torres incident.7 The relevant anti-retaliation provision states:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n       discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . .\n       because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\n       practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified,\n       assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\n       hearing under this subchapter.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\n       7\n            Actually, she was not the reporting party, but did supply a statement.\n\n\n                                                 - 12 -\n\f       Establishing a prima facie case requires a plaintiff to show “(1) that he engaged in\n\nprotected opposition to discrimination, (2) that a reasonable employee would have found\n\nthe challenged action materially adverse, and (3) that a causal connection existed between\n\nthe protected activity and the materially adverse action.” Argo v. Blue Cross & Blue\n\nShield of Kan., Inc., 452 F.3d 1193, 1202 (10th Cir. 2006) (footnote omitted). “[T]he\n\nantiretaliation provision . . . is not limited to discriminatory actions that affect the terms\n\nand conditions of employment.” Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, 548 U.S.\n\n53, 64 (2006). Instead, the plaintiff must demonstrate a reasonable employee would have\n\nfound the challenged action materially adverse, which means “the employer’s actions\n\nmust be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from\n\nmaking or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Id. at 57. “A causal connection may\n\nbe shown by evidence of circumstances that justify an inference of retaliatory motive,\n\nsuch as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action.” O’Neal v. Ferguson\n\nConstr. Co., 237 F.3d 1248, 1253 (10th Cir. 2001) (quotation omitted). Standing alone,\n\ntemporal proximity between the protected activity and the retaliatory conduct must be\n\nvery close in time. Otherwise, “the plaintiff must offer additional evidence to establish\n\ncausation.” Id.\n\n       Cavalry argues KaRon’s retaliation claim must fail because she did not engage in\n\na protected activity when she wrote her summary of the Torres incident. It argues she did\n\nnot initiate a complaint and the content of her statement did not notify Cavalry she was\n\nopposing an employment practice in violation of Title VII. KaRon claims it makes no\n\ndifference whether she initiated the complaint against Torres. Because Cavalry does not\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\fdispute it knew Torres made allegedly racist remarks to KaRon in the presence of other\n\nemployees, her report regarding the incident clearly opposed Torres’ conduct.\n\n       KaRon is correct that she need not have initiated the complaint to management to\n\ncome within the statute’s protection. In Crawford v. Metro. Gov’t. of Nashville &\n\nDavidson County, Tenn., the Supreme Court held:\n\n       [A] person can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s question just as\n       surely as by provoking the discussion, and nothing in the statute requires a\n       freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her own\n       initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same\n       words when her boss asks a question.\n\n129 S. Ct. 846, 851 (2009). However, she misperceives what constitutes an unlawful\n\n“employment practice.” A complaint of a single racist remark by a colleague, without\n\nmore, is not “opposition protected by Title VII.” Jordan v. Alternative Res., Corp., 467\n\nF.3d 378, 380 (4th Cir. 2006).\n\n       As the law stands, Title VII does not create a claim for every employee who\n       complains about the potential for Title VII violations or about other\n       employees’ isolated racial slurs. It protects an employee who opposes ‘any\n       practice made an unlawful employment practice,’ 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a),\n       or who ‘reasonably believes’ he is opposing a practice made an unlawful\n       practice by Title VII.\n\nId. “The employer must know not only that the employee has opposed an action of the\n\nemployer . . ., but that the opposition was based on a belief that the employer’s action\n\nconstituted discrimination prohibited by Title VII (here, racial or national-origin\n\ndiscrimination).” Zokari v. Gates, 561 F.3d 1076, 1081 (10th Cir. 2009) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n       In Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, a female employee claimed retaliation after\n\n\n\n                                               - 14 -\n\fshe met with her male supervisor and another male co-employee to review psychological\n\nreports for four job applicants. In one applicant’s report, the applicant had stated to a co-\n\nworker, “I hear making love to you is like making love to the Grand Canyon.” 532 U.S.\n\n268, 269 (2001) (per curium). “The supervisor read the comment aloud, looked at the\n\nfemale employee and said, ‘I don’t know what that means.’ The other employee then\n\nsaid, ‘Well, I'll tell you later,’ and both men chuckled.” Id. The female employee\n\ncomplained about the remarks to the supervisor and two assistant superintendents.\n\nReversing the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court upheld the dismissal of the employee's\n\nretaliation claim, concluding that “no one could reasonably believe that the incident . . .\n\nviolated Title VII.” Id. at 270.\n\n       The Court explained: “Title VII forbids actions taken on the basis of sex that\n\n‘discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions,\n\nor privileges of employment.’” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1)). “Hence, a\n\nrecurring point in [Supreme Court] opinions is that simple teasing, offhand comments,\n\nand isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory\n\nchanges in the terms and conditions of employment.” Id. at 271 (quotations and\n\nalterations omitted). Thus, the Court “implicitly reject[ed] any interpretation of Title VII\n\nwhich would permit a plaintiff to maintain a retaliation claim based on an unreasonable\n\ngood-faith belief that the underlying conduct violated Title VII.” Crumpacker v. Kan.\n\nDep’t of Human Res., 338 F.3d 1163, 1171 (10th Cir. 2003). “[T]he absence of a\n\nreference to unlawful discrimination . . . can preclude a retaliation claim because an\n\nemployer cannot engage in unlawful retaliation if it does not know that the employee has\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fopposed or is opposing a violation of Title VII.” Petersen v. Utah Dep't of Corr., 301\n\nF.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir. 2002).8\n\n       No reasonable person could have believed that the single Torres incident violated\n\nTitle VII’s standard. It is undisputed the employees’ reports, including KaRon’s, do not\n\nclaim Cavalry did anything wrong. They state a co-employee made a racial slur. In the\n\nwords of the Fourth Circuit: “[N]othing in our ruling condones the contemptible\n\ncomment made by the coworker in this case . . . . [But] complaining about an isolated\n\nracial slur is not opposition protected by Title VII.” Jordan, 467 F.3d at 380. Thus,\n\nKaRon failed to establish her prima facie retaliation case.\n\n       2.     Disparate Treatment\n\n       Title VII’s anti-discrimination provision states:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer-\n\n       (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\n       discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n       conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race,\n       color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n\n       8\n          See also Pope v. ESA Serv’s, Inc., 406 F.3d 1001, 1010 (8th Cir. 2005) (in Title\nVII retaliation case, employee’s comments about the absence of black managers did not\nconstitute protected activity because employee failed to attribute the absence of managers\nto racial discrimination); Trammel v. Simmons First Bank of Searcy, 345 F.3d 611, 615\n(8th Cir. 2003) (ADEA plaintiff’s letter-writing campaign accusing employer of improper\nloan procedures was not protected activity because the letters were not written to oppose\nage discrimination); Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health, Inc., 313 F.3d 205, 216-17\n(4th Cir. 2002) (physician’s ADA retaliation claim failed because her opposition to her\nemployer’s treatment of dialysis patients was based on violations of state medical\nmalpractice law and not the ADA); Barber v. CSX Distrib. Serv’s., 68 F.3d 694, 701 (3d\nCir. 1995) (employee’s ADEA retaliation claim failed because employee’s criticism of\nemployer's selection of a less qualified, younger applicant for a job, without specifically\ncomplaining about age discrimination, did not constitute protected conduct).\n\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\f       (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for\n       employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n       individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his\n       status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion,\n       sex, or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a).\n\n       In a disparate treatment case, the plaintiff must show “(1) that [s]he is a member of\n\na racial minority, (2) that [s]he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that\n\nsimilarly situated employees were treated differently.” Trujillo v. Univ. of Colo. Health\n\nSciences Ctr., 157 F.3d 1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 1998).9 Cavalry argues KaRon failed to\n\nproduce evidence that she suffered an adverse employment action or similarly situated\n\nemployees were treated differently. Moreover, she failed to demonstrate Cavalry’s\n\n\n\n       9\n          The evidentiary basis for the district court’s determination that KaRon presented\nsufficient evidence to establish her disparate treatment claim and pretext is hazy. After\nthe hearing on the post-trial motions, the district court orally ruled it would rely on the\nreasons stated in its written order denying the motion for a directed verdict to hold “that\nbased on the evidence adduced at trial a reasonable jury would have had a legally\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for the plaintiff with respect to her claims of disparate\ntreatment, hostile work environment and retaliation.” (R. Vol. III at 1518.) The court\nthen stated: “Certain of defendant’s explanations given were such that I think plaintiff\nfailed to show that some of those business reasons were pretextual . . . . So at least with\nrespect to that one ACH . . . plaintiff failed to show that Ms. Bemore’s actions [reissuing\nthe ACH] were pretextual. I don’t believe, though, that . . . . I heard a sufficient business\nreason given with respect to the low number of accounts and even if it is ultimately\ndetermined that the record does support that, I do believe that plaintiff adduced sufficient\nevidentiary support to show that the business reason for the low number of accounts was\npretextual. Then we get into the temporal proximity and I think the record should reflect\nI remember many, many arguments about temporal proximity on the record here at trial.”\n(Id. at 1518-19.)\n\n       The court’s written order gives no rationale or examples from the evidence at trial\nexplaining its denial of the directed verdict other than stating the retaliation claim was\nsupported by “the fact that she did . . . complain.” (R. Vol. I at 107.)\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\fbusiness reason for the number of her accounts was pretext.\n\n              a)      Adverse Employment Action\n\n       “Only acts that constitute a significant change in employment status, such as\n\nhiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits will rise to the level\n\nof an adverse employment action.” Haynes v. Level 3 Commc’ns, LLC, 456 F.3d 1215,\n\n1222 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted). “While adverse employment actions extend\n\nbeyond readily quantifiable losses, not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an\n\nactionable adverse action. Otherwise, minor and even trivial employment actions . . .\n\nwould form the basis of a discrimination suit.” MacKenzie v. City & County of Denver,\n\n414 F.3d 1266, 1279 (10th Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). KaRon asserts the evidence\n\nestablished three adverse employment actions: (1) Cavalry failed to promote her out of\n\nAcademy Bay while promoting less qualified candidates; (2) she was given a lower\n\nnumber of accounts and/or lower quality accounts to prevent her from reaching her goals\n\nand receiving commissions; and (3) her commission rates were inappropriately lowered\n\nwhile she worked with Shaw’s team.\n\n                      (1) Failure to Promote\n\n       KaRon introduced a report listing Academy Bay employees’ post-dated check\n\namounts for an unspecified month. Although KaRon had the most checks and the largest\n\namount of payments, several of the other employees on the report were moved from\n\nAcademy Bay to a floor unit before KaRon. KaRon also introduced six “report cards”\n\nfrom September through December 2004. The report cards were issued daily to notify\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\fthe Academy Bay trainees of their progress. Each assessed KaRon as a “strong\n\nperformer” and one classified her as an “elite” performer. (R. Vol. II at 668-69.)\n\nOrlando testified a Cavalry manager, Darrell Bunch, told him “[KaRon’s] the best\n\ncollector in [Academy Bay]” and Bunch was trying to get her on his team but Brown and\n\nTipton said “she wasn’t ready” and “to pick someone else.” (Id. at 891.) He also\n\ntestified Bunch stated “[he did not] know why they’re intentionally holding her back.”\n\n(Id. at 892.)\n\n       Bemore testified a collector would graduate if her work was consistent and met\n\nfive criteria in one month. The exact requirements were often modified but, at one point,\n\nthe requirements included: (1) negotiate five payment arrangements; (2) negotiate five\n\nsettlements; (3) complete three ACH forms; (4) achieve 35% of the specialist’s monthly\n\ngoal and average 150 calls daily; and (5) negotiate five post-dated accounts for at least\n\n$1,000 gross. Bemore agreed KaRon was focused, professional and “showing\n\nconsistency.” (Id. at 524.) She testified KaRon helped train a newer employee, Kim\n\nCooper, who graduated before KaRon. When KaRon asked why Cooper graduated from\n\nAcademy Bay, Bemore responded, “Kim must have hit all of her criteria or she wouldn’t\n\nhave graduated.” (Id. at 522.) Bemore stated she thought KaRon met several of the\n\ncriteria each month but did not “think that [KaRon] hit every single piece of the criteria.”\n\n(Id. at 513.)\n\n       Madewell testified management decided to retain some more experienced workers\n\nwithin Academy Bay so the floor managers would be assigned seasoned as well as new\n\nspecialists. At least ten collectors were in Academy Bay when it closed at the end of\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fDecember 2004. Three of the collectors had been employed longer than KaRon -- Vince\n\nBrinkley, Judy Riley and Kathy Norton. Brinkley was listed as the number one Academy\n\nBay employee on one of the report cards introduced by KaRon and number three on\n\nanother. Riley was listed as number two.\n\n      After careful review of the evidence, we must conclude KaRon failed to show she\n\nwas treated differently than other employees in regards to her promotion or that the\n\nbusiness reasons proffered by Cavalry were pretext. While KaRon demonstrated she was\n\nvery successful in some aspects of her work, she simply did not prove she had met the\n\ngraduation criteria in a single month. There was no testimony or documentary evidence\n\ndemonstrating other employees had graduated without meeting all the criteria. In\n\naddition, KaRon’s exhibits demonstrated that equally qualified employees, such as\n\nBrinkley, also remained in Academy Bay through December 2004. Although Bunch told\n\nOrlando he believed KaRon was the best worker in Academy Bay, there is no evidence\n\nBunch was involved with Academy Bay decisions or that he knew the relative abilities of\n\nall the Academy Bay employees.\n\n                    (2) Commission Rates\n\n       KaRon claimed Cavalry’s discrimination against her also included the lowering of\n\nher commission rate after she had made arrangements for payments. She introduced\n\nprintouts of accounts in which her commission rate was lowered from its original level.\n\nHowever, Mitchell and Bemore testified they too had commissions on paying accounts\n\nlowered; some were changed back but others were not. Bemore stated if the employee\n\nnotifies his manager and there was a mistake, the rate was changed back. KaRon then\n\n                                              - 20 -\n\fasked: “Have you ever heard of anyone at Cavalry other than myself have a commission\n\nrate changed and nobody change it back to the previous commission rate?” (Vol. II at\n\n502.) Bemore responded: “To my knowledge, they’re supposed to be changed back . . . .\n\nAs an employee now, I notify my direct report which is Andrew Brown and he sends an\n\ne-mail and then he gets back with me and then it’s rectified.” (Id.)\n\n       Mitchell and Brown reiterated commissions were changed on paying deals and the\n\nemployee must bring the problem to the attention of a manager, who would then check\n\nwith the Phoenix office to determine the reason for the change. KaRon presented no\n\ntestimony that she requested Shaw investigate a commission change and even KaRon’s\n\nquestions did not imply she asked to have her commissions reinstated to their original\n\nlevel. Moreover, many of the exhibits showing a decreased commission occurred while,\n\naccording to Orlando, his wife was getting along well in Shaw’s unit. Thus, the jury was\n\ngiven no factual basis to reasonably conclude KaRon was treated differently than other\n\nsimilarly situated employees when her commission rate changed or that the business\n\nreason for the change was pretext.\n\n                     (3) Number and Quality of KaRon’s Accounts\n\n       KaRon claimed she was given fewer and less workable accounts than others after\n\nthe Torres incident. Vince Brinkley testified on one occasion, at some point in time,\n\nKaRon showed him she had only 79 accounts in her queue. Brinkley stated the number\n\nwas not appropriate and he had no less than 800 to 900 accounts in his queue. Orlando\n\nrecounted a manager’s meeting he attended when Bemore told Madewell KaRon did not\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 21 -\n\fhave any accounts.10 When Orlando asked why, Madewell told him “well, I did it for a\n\nreason but I’ll talk to you about it later.” (Id. at 887.) In addition, Orlando stated his\n\nwife had shown him accounts missing from her queue with Bemore’s initials on them,\n\nimplying Bemore somehow inappropriately moved these accounts.\n\n       Gregory Mitchell testified the Robinsons complained to him that KaRon was not\n\ntreated fairly in the distribution of accounts and Bemore was not properly scanning\n\nKaRon’s ACH accounts into the system. Mitchell reported these complaints to Brown\n\nand Warren, but he did not recall what happened to the reports.\n\n       KaRon submitted several printouts showing the number of her accounts on four\n\ndates while she worked in Shaw’s unit. The printouts showed: on January 28, 2005,\n\nKaRon had a total of 218 accounts; on January 31, 2005, a total of 191 accounts; on\n\nFebruary 2, 2005, a total of 190 accounts; on February 3, 2005, a total of 147 accounts;\n\nand, on April 13, 2005, a total of 211 accounts. Mitchell testified it would be possible for\n\na specialist to hit her goal with these numbers but unlikely if the accounts were less than\n\n$500.00. Kari Kiger testified that when she worked with KaRon in Shaw’s unit, KaRon\n\nasked Shaw for more accounts because she only had 300. Kiger said Cavalry managers\n\nhad said “they could get [accounts] for [Kiger] personally” if she “didn’t have enough\n\naccounts.” (Vol. II at 861.) However, “to [Kiger’s] knowledge” nothing was done about\n\nKaRon’s number of accounts. (Id. at 858.)\n\n\n       10\n         One may wonder why Bemore would notify Madewell that KaRon needed\nmore accounts if Bemore was deliberately reducing her accounts to insure KaRon’s\nfailure.\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f       KaRon also claimed Bemore discriminated against her by returning unworkable\n\naccounts to her queue. KaRon submitted 52 printouts of her computer screen showing\n\naccounts she had “exhausted” as uncollectible which Bemore returned to her queue to\n\n“rework” between the end of November through December 2004. Orlando testified that\n\non “several” of those accounts “[t]here was nothing more that could be done with the\n\naccount and they were given back to [KaRon]. There were bankruptcies that legally we\n\ncannot call, deceased accounts, people who are dead, you can’t collect[] from them\n\nbecause they are deceased.” (Id. at 888.)\n\n       Cavalry maintained the managers at the Tulsa office did not participate in the\n\ndistribution of accounts. Brown, Shaw, Madewell and Kiger all testified the number of\n\nnew accounts for each specialist was determined by the Phoenix office.11 While Shaw\n\nstated he believed Warren had access to distribute accounts “at one time,” he did not\n\ntestify when this occurred. (Id. at 716.) Orlando testified “at one particular time\n\n[disbursement] did get switched to Phoenix, but when I was there at one time this Tulsa\n\noffice had control of distribution.” (Id. at 896.) Neither Orlando nor Shaw testified Tulsa\n\ndistributed the accounts from October 2004 through April 2005, the time period KaRon\n\nclaims she was discriminated against.\n\n       Testimony regarding who had the ability to transfer accounts after assignment\n\nwas, at best, confusing. It is uncontested the managers could move accounts back to a\n\nspecialist to rework. Madewell marked one of KaRon’s accounts for “rework.” (Id. at\n\n       11\n         Brinkley was unsure, but assumed the Tulsa office distributed the accounts\nbecause “someone has to do it.” (Id. at 853.)\n\n\n                                               - 23 -\n\f977.) Upper Tulsa management—Brown, Warren and Madewell—could also request\n\nmore accounts from Phoenix for specialists. It appears at least one Tulsa employee could\n\nmove an account upon request from upper management for the purpose of assigning\n\nrelated accounts or for other business reasons. It was uncontested the number of accounts\n\nin a queue could change daily or even within the same day. Specialists could exhaust an\n\naccount or move it to the Spanish bin.12 Affording every reasonable inference in favor of\n\nKaRon, the jury could reasonably believe, at least on certain dates, KaRon received fewer\n\naccounts than her colleagues because upper management was not acting as forcefully on\n\nher behalf as it did for other specialists.13\n\n       The next question is whether KaRon provided evidence that the managers’ failure\n\nto secure more accounts for KaRon altered the terms and conditions of her employment.\n\nOrlando opined he never had less than 500 accounts and “unless you have an adequate\n\nnumber of accounts, you cannot hit your goal consistently . . . . [I]t’s impossible.” (Id. at\n\n882.) But KaRon did not submit evidence regarding her salary, the amount she made on\n\ncommission or her ability to meet her monthly goals. She did produce disciplinary\n\n\n       12\n           By unilaterally moving an account to the Spanish bin, a specialist could\nartificially reduce the number of accounts in their queue.\n       13\n          KaRon would have us conclude that the fact the Phoenix office assigned the\naccounts “only serves to underscore the fact that upper management, including Todd\nTipton of the Phoenix office, was in on the decision to, together with Madewell and\nBemore, intentionally discriminate against [KaRon].” (Appellee’s Response Br. at 38.)\nThis conclusion would be based solely on speculation. There is no evidence Phoenix\nmanagement, other than Tipton in Human Resources, knew about the Torres incident and\nno evidence Tipton had any connection to the account distribution department. KaRon\npresented no evidence of conspiracy between the Tulsa and Phoenix offices.\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\freports of verbal warnings given to three other workers for failing to maintain their\n\ncollections at an acceptable level but no similar reports on her performance. In addition,\n\nKaRon presented no evidence showing the number of exhausted accounts returned to her\n\nqueue were larger than the number returned to other employees. Because KaRon failed\n\nto provide evidence that the number of accounts in her queue changed the terms and\n\nconditions of her employment, she failed to submit evidence sufficient to establish her\n\nprima facie case.\n\n       3.     Hostile Work Environment\n\n       “[A] plaintiff may establish a violation of Title VII by proving that discrimination\n\nbased on sex has created a hostile or abusive work environment.” Meritor Savings Bank,\n\nFSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 66 (1986). A hostile work environment claim requires a\n\nplaintiff to show “that under the totality of the circumstances (1) the harassment was\n\npervasive or severe enough to alter the terms, conditions, or privilege of employment, and\n\n(2) the harassment was racial or stemmed from racial animus.” Chavez v. New Mexico,\n\n397 F.3d 826, 832 (10th Cir. 2005). Severity and pervasiveness are evaluated according\n\nto the totality of the circumstances, considering such factors as “the frequency of the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or\n\na mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's\n\nwork performance.” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993); see also Harsco\n\nCorp. v. Renner, 475 F.3d 1179, 1187 (10th Cir. 2007) (listing factors to be considered in\n\ndetermining whether environment is hostile or abusive). “Facially neutral abusive\n\nconduct can support a finding of . . . animus sufficient to sustain a hostile work\n\n                                               - 25 -\n\fenvironment claim when that conduct is viewed in the context of other, overtly [racially]\n\ndiscriminatory conduct.” O’Shea v. Yellow Tech. Serv’s., 185 F.3d 1093, 1097 (10th Cir.\n\n1999). “A plaintiff cannot meet this burden by demonstrating a few isolated incidents of\n\nracial enmity or sporadic racial slurs.” Chavez, 397 F.3d at 832 (quotations omitted).\n\n       KaRon claims there was no discrimination prior to the Torres incident but shortly\n\nthereafter she experienced a significant change in the way she was treated by her\n\nsupervisors. Looking at the period of time from October 21, 2004, through December 30,\n\n2004, while KaRon was in Academy Bay, Vince Brinkley testified it seemed Bemore and\n\nKaRon were “okay” but “all of a sudden” there were “quite a few incidents.” (R. Vol. II\n\nat 852.) He said he “kind of felt” like Bemore treated KaRon more harshly than other\n\nemployees and, on one occasion, told KaRon to “sit down and shut up.” (Id. at 841, 852.)\n\nIn addition, Brinkley testified Madewell would not answer KaRon’s question at an\n\nemployee meeting even after another employee said “[KaRon] has a question.” (Id. at\n\n842.) Brinkley stated Madewell “made a reference to [KaRon] being stupid or something\n\nlike that.” (Id.)\n\n       KaRon claimed Bemore unfairly gave her a written disciplinary action on\n\nNovember 18, 2004. Brown explained he called a meeting with KaRon on November 17,\n\n2004, which Bemore and Warren attended. Bemore was told KaRon was taking her\n\naccounts to Orlando to work for her. At that time, the employees on the floor had\n\nadditional tools to work an account that were unavailable in Academy Bay. Brown told\n\nKaRon she could not ask her husband to work her accounts. He separately told Orlando\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\fhe could do “a second talk-off,”14 but could not work KaRon’s accounts as it would give\n\nher an unfair advantage. (Id. at 1066.)\n\n       After the meeting KaRon moved her workspace, which had been located next to\n\nBemore’s, to another cubicle farther away from Bemore. The managers called KaRon\n\nback in because a work station could not be moved without advance permission. The\n\nmeeting took place in a glass conference room which could be seen by other employees.\n\nDuring this meeting, KaRon became visibly upset and left. She called her husband in\n\ntears and told him to bring her the keys in the break room. Orlando testified KaRon told\n\nhim she had been “ambushed,” and to let Bemore know she was outside and could not\n\nreturn to work. (Id. at 874) Orlando testified he did so and Bemore “offered to clock her\n\nout.” The next day, Bemore gave KaRon a written reprimand for moving her workstation\n\nwithout permission and for leaving work without notifying her supervisor. Bemore\n\ntestified Cavalry’s policy required an employee to give notice directly to the supervisor\n\nbefore leaving early from work. In response, KaRon submitted a report recounting an\n\nincident during Torres’s employment when Torres’s wife brought a note stating he was ill\n\nbut Bemore did not reprimand Torres for failing to call.\n\n       Kiger testified there were two instances when she heard negative comments\n\nregarding the Robinsons. The timing of these statements was not established. The first\n\ncomment was made by an unidentified male employee who continues to work at Cavalry.\n\n\n       14\n         Employees were encouraged to assist each other when a debtor was recalcitrant\nabout payment. Often a second voice may be persuasive, “especially male versus\nfemale.” (Vol. II at 1066.)\n\n\n                                              - 27 -\n\fKiger stated he said, “I personally wouldn’t do that [inter-racial marriage] myself but if\n\nthat makes them happy, good.” (Id. at 859.) Kiger described the situation as follows:\n\n“[Y]ou know, otherwise he wasn’t condoning your relationship as you being married but\n\nhe wasn’t going to say that it, he was sugar-coating it . . . I don’t know why he wouldn’t\n\nwant you to be married, but for the type of jokes the person makes, I would say it would\n\nprobably be racial.” (Id. at 859-60.) Kiger also testified, “[a]t some point in time\n\n[Bemore made] a comment to [Kiger] that [Kiger] felt was inappropriate due to [the\n\nRobinsons’] interracial relationship.” (Id. at 861-62.) Kiger did not reveal what Bemore\n\nsaid nor did Kiger testify she relayed these comments to KaRon.\n\n       KaRon was transferred to Shaw’s unit less than three months after the Torres\n\nincident and did not thereafter associate with Bemore. Kiger testified Shaw was\n\noccasionally unavailable, “condescending” and “overbearing” to KaRon but she never\n\nsaw Shaw directly intimidate KaRon. (Id. at 862.). Other employees also complained\n\nabout Shaw’s supervision. Orlando testified Shaw was not “hostile” to KaRon “until\n\ntowards the end.” (Id. at 891.) He did not testify how Shaw was hostile.\n\n       Even when viewing these circumstances with all favorable inferences to KaRon’s\n\nclaims the evidence revealed, at most, an unpleasant work environment. Bemore and\n\nMadewell were rude on one occasion. Bemore, known as a harsh supervisor, picked on\n\nKaRon. However, on cross-examination, Orlando confirmed no one ever made a\n\nnegative comment to him about the racial difference between him and his wife. He\n\nconceded he never complained that he felt like he was being treated unfairly because of\n\nhis race and neither Bemore nor Madewell made any comments which would indicate\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\fthere was a problem with the fact he was married to a white woman. It is further\n\nuncontested that neither KaRon nor her husband told upper management or the human\n\nresources department that KaRon believed she was being discriminated against because\n\nof her marriage.\n\n       Without discriminatory overtones, discourteous treatment is simply not sufficient\n\nto impose liability under Title VII. See Chavez, 397 F.3d at 833. (“Title VII is not a code\n\nof workplace conduct . . . a hostile environment claim requires a showing not only of\n\nsevere and pervasive harassment, but of severe and pervasive harassment based on\n\n[race].”). While KaRon may have believed Bemore was unfair, “this court’s obligation is\n\nnot to mandate that certain individuals work on their interpersonal skills and cease\n\nengaging in inter-departmental personality conflicts.” Somoza v. Univ. of Denver, 513\n\nF.3d 1206, 1218 (10th Cir. 2008); see also MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1280 (courts “should\n\nfilter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace”).15\n\n\n       15\n          The jury’s conclusion to the contrary is not surprising given KaRon’s questions\nand comments during the trial. KaRon did not testify, but instead accused the witnesses\nof discriminatory behavior in her questions, implying she had personal knowledge the\nCavalry witnesses were lying when they denied the accusations. For example, the\nfollowing colloquy took place during KaRon’s direct examination of Bemore:\n\n       Q.     [O]n November 17th, could you please explain to the jury what\n              happened on that day?\n\n       A.     What day is that?\n\n       Q.     The day we had a one-on-one meeting and you had told me that I\n              wasn’t allowed to be seen or speak to my husband, even on breaks\n              and lunches, because it made other people uncomfortable?\n\n       A.     I didn’t tell you that.\n\n\n                                               - 29 -\n\f       Because the evidence at trial failed to establish KaRon engaged in protected\n\nopposition to a discriminatory employment practice or that she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action, the district court erred in denying Cavalry’s request for judgment as\n\na matter of law. In light of our ruling on the hostile work environment claim, we are\n\nconfident that the district court was correct in not allowing Ms. Robinson’s constructive\n\ndischarge claim to go to the jury. Hall v. U.S. Dep’t of Labor, 476 F.3d 847, 851 (10th\n\nCir. 2007) (“A constructive discharge claim based on a hostile work environment goes a\n\nstep farther. An employee is constructively discharged when the employer by his illegal\n\ndiscriminatory acts makes ‘working conditions so difficult that a reasonable person in the\n\nemployee’s position would feel compelled to resign.’” (citing Sanchez v. Denver Pub.\n\nSchs., 164 F.3d 527, 534 (10th Cir. 1998); see also Johnson v. Weld County, Colo., No.\n\n\n(R. Vol. II at 566-67.) During Shaw’s testimony:\n\n       Q.     Did you find it necessary to pull all married couples apart at the\n              same time and put them in separate meetings?\n\n       A.     I didn’t pull any married couples apart.\n\n(Id. at 735.). During Brown’s testimony she inferred he was lying when he said Kiger\nhad not come to him to relate derogatory comments about her marriage. (Id. at 677.) In\nfact, Kiger never testified she went to Brown. KaRon also asked Mitchell, “Did you ever\ntell anyone at Cavalry you were going to lie during your deposition?” (Id. at 979.) These\nare just a few examples of the type of “testimony” KaRon was able to present to the jury.\n\n       While the court gave a proper cautionary instruction, the mere volume of\nallegations repeated in the questions (and not substantiated through testimony or other\nevidence) would have been nearly impossible for the jury to ignore. In fact, no evidence\nof damages was presented at the first trial other than one comment made as an\nafterthought in KaRon’s closing. She stated, “I forgot this earlier but the back pay that is\nowed to me after what I made in Nevada is $158,000 for the past two years.” (Id. at\n1118). No other evidence was presented at trial. The jury awarded her $150,001.\n\n\n                                               - 30 -\n\f08-1365, Slip. Op. at 26 n.6 (10th Cir. Feb. 8, 2010) (“Because Ms. Johnson’s facts fail to\n\nmeet the threshold required for a retaliation claim — a material adverse harm — it\n\nfollows that those same facts cannot satisfy the higher threshold required for a\n\nconstructive discharge claim.”) Given our conclusion, we deem the remaining issues on\n\nappeal moot.\n\n         REVERSED and REMANDED for entry of judgment in accordance with this\n\norder.\n\n                                          Entered by the Court:\n\n                                          Terrence L.

We reverse and\n\nremand for the district court to enter a directed verdict for Cavalry on KaRon’s\n\ndiscrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment claims.\n\n                           I.      FACTUAL BACKGROUND2\n\n       Orlando and KaRon both worked at the Cavalry office in Tulsa, Oklahoma.\n\nOrlando began working at Cavalry in December, 2003. He recruited his wife to apply for\n\na job and she began her employment with Cavalry on July 26, 2004.\n\nA.     Cavalry’s Business Operations and Payment Structure.\n\n       Cavalry is a debt collection service agency. Its home office is located in Phoenix,\n\nArizona, with satellite offices in St. Paul, Minnesota and Tulsa, Oklahoma. Collection\n\nspecialists (specialists) such as KaRon are assigned delinquent accounts to try to collect.\n\nThe original distribution of accounts is automatically sent to the individual specialist’s\n\nqueue by the portfolio managers in the Phoenix office, usually within the first ten days of\n\n\n\n       1\n           We use the Robinsons’ first names for clarity and ease of expression.\n       2\n           These facts were not contested at trial.\n\fthe month.3 On the collection floor, specialists are placed in “teams” under one manager\n\nwho, in turn, reports to a manager/director. If a specialist does not receive an adequate\n\namount of accounts, it is the manager’s responsibility to go to a director to ask that\n\nPhoenix be notified of the situation. Managers do not work individual accounts, but\n\nreceive commissions based on the collections of the people on their team. Some\n\nspecialists who work “manual” accounts (meaning the specialist manually dials the phone\n\nrather than having a computer automatically dial their next account) have access to a\n\ncomputer program, called “skip tools,” to research and correct debtors’ invalid telephone\n\nnumbers or addresses.\n\n       Collection accounts differed in the amount owed and in the difficulty in\n\nsuccessfully negotiating repayment. During a new employee’s training, Cavalry\n\n“[g]enerally . . . focused on the newer people working smaller balanced accounts\n\n[approximately $500.00] . . . [because] the [training specialists] didn’t have skip tools.”\n\n(Vol. II at 652.) Specialists could accept several forms of payment from the debtors.\n\nOne form was post-dated checks. Another was an Automatic Clearinghouse payment (an\n\nACH). This is an agreement from a customer to automatically pay monthly from his or\n\nher bank account. The advantage for the customer is he or she pays no interest. The\n\nbenefit for the collection specialist is the monthly payment goes toward his or her\n\ncommission every month without having to follow up with the customer.\n\n\n       3\n          There was some testimony that, at one time, Tulsa management had control of\nthe distribution of accounts to its office. However, there was no testimony that this\ncontrol was in effect during KaRon’s employment.\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\f       Specialists could also “exhaust” an account because it was uncollectible. The\n\nspecialist’s computer screen allowed them to designate one of three different reasons to\n\nexhaust: unable to locate a customer after a diligent search; customer unable to pay; and\n\nthe customer’s absolute refusal to pay. When an account is exhausted, the collector\n\npresses a button on the computer and the account is forwarded to the collector’s\n\nmanager’s queue to either be sent on as uncollectible or, if the specialist is exhausting too\n\nmany accounts, sent back to the specialist for them to try contacting the debtor again.\n\n       A major potential source of income for a collections specialist is the commission\n\nreceived on paying accounts. The commission percentage is based on a scoring formula\n\nderived from different factors relating to a debtor’s propensity to pay on the account and\n\nthe availability of state laws to enforce collections. The Phoenix office assigns a higher\n\ncommission rate on more difficult accounts. For example, if the debtor was located in a\n\nstate where the laws were not favorable to suit, the commission rate would be higher. If\n\nthe specialist discovered the current address of the debtor had changed to a different state\n\nwith a lower rating factor, the commission would be changed as well. The commission\n\nfor each payment was applied to the specialist’s monthly goal – an amount calculated\n\nfrom the specialist’s pay rate and the number of hours worked each month. As a\n\nspecialist’s negotiated payments reached incremental levels approaching her goal, such as\n\n50%, 75% and 100%, she would receive increasing bonus payments.\n\nB.     KaRon Robinson’s Employment\n\n       1.     Academy Bay\n\n       At the time KaRon was employed, all new employees were assigned to work in\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fthe training unit known as Academy Bay, an experimental training program initiated in\n\nMay or June 2004. Upon completion of certain criteria, an employee would “graduate”\n\nto the floor and receive an assignment to a collection team. Rhonda Bemore was the\n\nmanager of Academy Bay and the direct supervisor of approximately twenty new\n\nemployees. Bemore’s supervisors were Andrew Brown, Vice-President of Tulsa\n\noperations, Mickey Warren (title unknown) and Mike Madewell, Site Manager and “for a\n\nperiod of time,” Academy Bay Director. (Vol. II at 769.) Madewell determined who\n\nwould graduate to the floor with input from Brown and Bemore. While in Academy Bay,\n\nKaRon complained to Brown about Bemore’s supervision claiming “she was a little more\n\nstrict or a little more harsh than she should be, that she didn’t get [KaRon’s] letters done\n\nvery efficiently, [and] that she didn’t answer [KaRon’s] questions in a professional\n\nmanner.” (Id. at 638.)\n\n       2.     Racial Incident\n\n       On October 21, 2004, Kim Cooper, a Cavalry employee in Academy Bay,\n\napproached Bemore to report an incident in the lunch room regarding race. Bemore\n\nasked who was involved and Cooper named KaRon and Mark Torres. Bemore relayed\n\nthe report to Madewell who summoned KaRon and Torres for interviews and to give\n\nwritten statements. Madewell spoke with KaRon first. She wrote the following\n\nstatement:\n\n       Mark and I were having lunch and Mark politely asked me if I only dated\n       black guys like Mariza did. I told him no I was attracted to both I just\n       happened to end up [with] one of a different race. He responded [with] the\n       fact that he would never date someone of another race, he just couldn’t\n       stand having to listen to them complain about the whole slavery topics. He\n\n                                                -5-\n\f      thought they used it as a crutch. Mark continued to express that he’s not a\n      racist that he just didn’t really like blacks until he got to know them.\n      Which is fine however there were several times he used the word “Nigger”\n      while referring to them. He explained that he just didn’t like the fact that\n      they can call each other by that word but he can’t call them that. I’m pretty\n      sure he wasn’t using the term neg[atively] he was just using the term to\n      describe a certain situation. However there were several people in the\n      breakroom and I’m sure they over-heard him using the term. I did [talk to]\n      him outside after lunch bec[ause] I was offended and Mark explained to me\n      that he was using the word to explain himself in that situation but he wasn’t\n      calling anyone here that. He apologized to me for even using the term and I\n      explained to him that I understood if he felt that however work is not the\n      place to discuss it. He had also made a comment that he didn’t have black\n      in his bloodline because if he did he would be scraping that sh_t off. I told\n      him that was a very racist thing to say and once again he cont[inued] to\n      explain that he has black friends, and he’s not a racist.\n\n(Vol. IV at 1589-90.)\n\n      Torres was interviewed next. He wrote in relevant part:\n\n      First of all I have to say that I am naturally a jokster [sic] and I am always\n      joking around with people, this is just who I am. Jokingly I [said] to\n      KaRon “if you leave your husband are you going to find you a good\n      looking white guy.” Obviously, I guess she got offended by me saying that\n      and she said kind of inquizitively [sic] “Are you prejudiced?” I said “No\n      of course not, I was just curious.”\n\n      Then me being the jokster [sic] that I am trying to be funny I was asking\n      my buddy Adam “why is it the black guys in my team can say “whats up\n      my nigga” to each other but if we said it we would get hurt.” I was just\n      giving my opinion in a funny way but because the N word was used, even\n      thought it was not directed at anyone, and even though if I happened to be\n      black I would not be writing this right now, it should not have been said.\n\n      My Opinion – I want to apolige [sic], but I would also like to say I really\n      don’t think its right that the N-word is [said] almost on a daily basis by\n      some of the black humans that work at this site. But because I [said] this\n      word, even though it was not directed at anyone and I would never direct\n      that word to anyone, that I am sitting here under question because I am not\n      African American. When I hear African Americans say this word daily.\n\n      I want to reiterate the word was not [said] towards anyone it was used in\n      the tense [sic] of asking a question. Thats it thats the bottom. [sic] Why,\n\n                                              -6-\n\f         because Mark Torres says so!\n\n(Id. at 1591-92.)\n\n         After reading Torres’ statement, Madewell also interviewed Adam Aven who\n\nwrote:\n\n         During lunch in the break room (east break room) myself, Mark T. and the\n         young lady were visiting together while we ate. She asked Marc for his\n         opinion [and] or thoughts on a particular subject [and] he proceeded to tell\n         her. Some of his views probably sounded “racial” in nature, but in reality\n         probably weren’t. But the way she perceived them may have offended her.\n\n(R. Vol. IV at 1588). Madewell gave Torres a verbal warning that his conduct would not\n\nbe tolerated and any further similar conduct would lead to disciplinary action, including\n\ntermination. Madewell then delivered the written statements to Vicki Arnold, the on-site\n\nhuman resources representative. In turn, Todd Tipton, director of human resources in\n\nPhoenix, was made aware of the statements.\n\n         Two days later, Torres was terminated for excessive tardiness. Apparently\n\nbelieving his statements to KaRon were at least a partial cause of his lay off, Torres was\n\nwaiting in the parking lot when KaRon and Orlando left work that evening. Torres\n\nshouted insults and threats. The Robinsons were asked to come back inside the building\n\nwhile someone else went outside to tell Torres he must leave or the police would be\n\ncalled. Torres left.\n\n         3.    David Shaw’s Unit\n\n         Academy Bay was discontinued at the end of December 2004 and the specialists\n\nremaining in Academy Bay were assigned to floor units. KaRon was assigned to David\n\nShaw’s unit. While in Shaw’s unit, KaRon complained about the amount of accounts she\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\freceived. The same complaint, however, was voiced by many specialists. She also\n\ninformed Shaw she was having problems with her computer but nothing was done about\n\nit. On April 20, 2005, without explanation, KaRon telephoned to submit her resignation.\n\nOrlando resigned the same day.\n\n       According to KaRon, her resignation was caused by her treatment after the Torres\n\nincident. She claimed Cavalry gave her fewer and less lucrative accounts, had her\n\ncommissions lowered and told her she could not be seen with her husband even though\n\nother couples were free to mingle. She also claimed she was not promoted out of\n\nAcademy Bay when other less competent employees graduated to the floor. She alleged\n\nshe was subject to verbal abuse and inequitable disciplinary measures by her supervisors\n\nand the conditions of her work forced her to resign.4\n\n                      II.     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\nA.     Pretrial\n\n       KaRon filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on\n\nJune 13, 2005, and on September 28, 2005, she received a notice of right to sue. She\n\nfiled her lawsuit on December 22, 2005, raising three claims: sexual discrimination,\n\nretaliation and hostile work environment pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n       4\n         KaRon’s anger and her intention to sue Cavalry at the time she resigned are not\ndisputed. Before leaving her employment, KaRon copied and retained numerous Cavalry\ndocuments containing client information. During re-direct examination of David Shaw,\nshe asked, “So you don’t think it’s fair that [I] secured the information to show . . .\nmistreatment?” (Vol. II at 739.) On her last day, she transferred 50 to 75 of her accounts\nto the “Spanish bin,” where the accounts would be assigned to a specialist proficient in\nSpanish. In her questions to Shaw, she stated she did this in an attempt to prevent Shaw\nfrom receiving any commission on those accounts.\n\n\n                                               -8-\n\f1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq., seeking actual, compensatory and punitive damages. At\n\nsome point KaRon abandoned her sexual discrimination claim. The pre-trial order\n\nidentifies the issues as: “1.) race discrimination [based on racial association]; 2.) hostile\n\nwork environment; and 3.) retaliation which ultimately resulted in her constructive\n\ndischarge.” (R. Vol. I at 37.)\n\nB.     Trial\n\n       The jury trial began on April 18, 2007, and continued through April 24, 2007.\n\nKaRon called Bemore, Brown, Madewell and Shaw to testify as hostile witnesses. She\n\nalso called black co-employees Vince Brinkley, who worked with her in Academy Bay,\n\nand Kari Kiger, a co-worker in David Shaw’s unit. In addition, KaRon presented\n\ntestimony from her husband (a manager-in-training) and Gregory Kent Mitchell, another\n\nmanager-in-training.\n\n       After KaRon presented her case, Cavalry moved for judgment as a matter of law\n\non all claims. The district court took the motion under advisement. At the completion of\n\nall evidence, Cavalry renewed its motion. The district court granted a directed verdict to\n\nCavalry on KaRon’s constructive discharge and punitive damages claims, but allowed the\n\njury to determine her discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment claims.\n\nC.     The Verdict and Post-Trial Motions\n\n       The jury returned with a verdict in KaRon’s favor on her discrimination,\n\nretaliation and hostile work environment claims, awarding her $150,001 in compensatory\n\ndamages and $150,000 in back pay. Both parties filed post-trial motions. KaRon\n\nrequested over two million dollars in future damages based on the jury’s finding she was\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fsubject to a hostile work environment which prevented her successful career at Cavalry.\n\nCavalry filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law claiming KaRon failed to\n\nestablish her prima facie case, and even if she did, she failed to show Cavalry’s business\n\nreasons for its actions were pretext. Cavalry also filed a motion for a new trial claiming\n\nKaRon’s emotional outbursts and improper questions tainted the trial’s outcome. The\n\ncourt granted Cavalry’s motion for a new trial solely on the back-pay damages. The\n\nremaining post-trial motions were denied.\n\n       Following a new trial on back-pay damages, the court reduced the jury’s award\n\nfrom $150,000 to $12,141.71 including interest. 5 Cavalry appeals from the denial of its\n\nmotions for either a directed verdict or a new trial. KaRon cross-appeals from the\n\ndirected verdict on constructive discharge (including future damages) and the denial of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n                                  III.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Waiver\n\n       As an initial matter, KaRon maintains Cavalry waived all but one of its arguments\n\non appeal because it failed to raise the other issues when making its pre-verdict motion\n\nfor a directed verdict.6 “To preserve a sufficiency of the evidence claim for appellate\n\nreview, a party must move for judgment as a matter of law (directed verdict) under\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) at the close of the evidence . . . . Motions under\n\nRule 50 must ‘specify the judgment sought and the law and the facts on which the\n\n       5\n           KaRon was represented by counsel at the damages trial before the district court.\n       6\n           KaRon does not specify exactly which argument she believes was preserved.\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fmoving party is entitled to the judgment.’” United Int’l Holdings, Inc. v.

Retaliation\n\n       KaRon claims Cavalry’s discriminatory actions were in retaliation for her report of\n\nthe Torres incident.7 The relevant anti-retaliation provision states:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\n       discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment . . .\n       because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment\n       practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified,\n       assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or\n       hearing under this subchapter.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a).\n\n       7\n            Actually, she was not the reporting party, but did supply a statement.\n\n\n                                                 - 12 -\n\f       Establishing a prima facie case requires a plaintiff to show “(1) that he engaged in\n\nprotected opposition to discrimination, (2) that a reasonable employee would have found\n\nthe challenged action materially adverse, and (3) that a causal connection existed between\n\nthe protected activity and the materially adverse action.” Argo v.

Instead, the plaintiff must demonstrate a reasonable employee would have\n\nfound the challenged action materially adverse, which means “the employer’s actions\n\nmust be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from\n\nmaking or supporting a charge of discrimination.” Id. at 57. “A causal connection may\n\nbe shown by evidence of circumstances that justify an inference of retaliatory motive,\n\nsuch as protected conduct closely followed by adverse action.” O’Neal v.

Standing alone,\n\ntemporal proximity between the protected activity and the retaliatory conduct must be\n\nvery close in time. Otherwise, “the plaintiff must offer additional evidence to establish\n\ncausation.” Id.\n\n       Cavalry argues KaRon’s retaliation claim must fail because she did not engage in\n\na protected activity when she wrote her summary of the Torres incident. It argues she did\n\nnot initiate a complaint and the content of her statement did not notify Cavalry she was\n\nopposing an employment practice in violation of Title VII. KaRon claims it makes no\n\ndifference whether she initiated the complaint against Torres. Because Cavalry does not\n\n                                                 - 13 -\n\fdispute it knew Torres made allegedly racist remarks to KaRon in the presence of other\n\nemployees, her report regarding the incident clearly opposed Torres’ conduct.\n\n       KaRon is correct that she need not have initiated the complaint to management to\n\ncome within the statute’s protection. In Crawford v. Metro. Gov’t. of Nashville &\n\nDavidson County, Tenn., the Supreme Court held:\n\n       [A] person can “oppose” by responding to someone else’s question just as\n       surely as by provoking the discussion, and nothing in the statute requires a\n       freakish rule protecting an employee who reports discrimination on her own\n       initiative but not one who reports the same discrimination in the same\n       words when her boss asks a question.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145915\"><a href=\"/opinion/145915/crawford-v-metropolitan-government-of-nashville-and-davidson-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

After\nthe hearing on the post-trial motions, the district court orally ruled it would rely on the\nreasons stated in its written order denying the motion for a directed verdict to hold “that\nbased on the evidence adduced at trial a reasonable jury would have had a legally\nsufficient evidentiary basis to find for the plaintiff with respect to her claims of disparate\ntreatment, hostile work environment and retaliation.” (R. Vol. III at 1518.) The court\nthen stated: “Certain of defendant’s explanations given were such that I think plaintiff\nfailed to show that some of those business reasons were pretextual . . . . So at least with\nrespect to that one ACH . . . plaintiff failed to show that Ms. Bemore’s actions [reissuing\nthe ACH] were pretextual. I don’t believe, though, that . . . .

KaRon asserts the evidence\n\nestablished three adverse employment actions: (1) Cavalry failed to promote her out of\n\nAcademy Bay while promoting less qualified candidates; (2) she was given a lower\n\nnumber of accounts and/or lower quality accounts to prevent her from reaching her goals\n\nand receiving commissions; and (3) her commission rates were inappropriately lowered\n\nwhile she worked with Shaw’s team.\n\n                      (1) Failure to Promote\n\n       KaRon introduced a report listing Academy Bay employees’ post-dated check\n\namounts for an unspecified month. Although KaRon had the most checks and the largest\n\namount of payments, several of the other employees on the report were moved from\n\nAcademy Bay to a floor unit before KaRon. KaRon also introduced six “report cards”\n\nfrom September through December 2004. The report cards were issued daily to notify\n\n\n                                                - 18 -\n\fthe Academy Bay trainees of their progress. Each assessed KaRon as a “strong\n\nperformer” and one classified her as an “elite” performer. (R. Vol. II at 668-69.)\n\nOrlando testified a Cavalry manager, Darrell Bunch, told him “[KaRon’s] the best\n\ncollector in [Academy Bay]” and Bunch was trying to get her on his team but Brown and\n\nTipton said “she wasn’t ready” and “to pick someone else.” (Id. at 891.) He also\n\ntestified Bunch stated “[he did not] know why they’re intentionally holding her back.”\n\n(Id. at 892.)\n\n       Bemore testified a collector would graduate if her work was consistent and met\n\nfive criteria in one month. The exact requirements were often modified but, at one point,\n\nthe requirements included: (1) negotiate five payment arrangements; (2) negotiate five\n\nsettlements; (3) complete three ACH forms; (4) achieve 35% of the specialist’s monthly\n\ngoal and average 150 calls daily; and (5) negotiate five post-dated accounts for at least\n\n$1,000 gross. Bemore agreed KaRon was focused, professional and “showing\n\nconsistency.” (Id. at 524.) She testified KaRon helped train a newer employee, Kim\n\nCooper, who graduated before KaRon. When KaRon asked why Cooper graduated from\n\nAcademy Bay, Bemore responded, “Kim must have hit all of her criteria or she wouldn’t\n\nhave graduated.” (Id. at 522.) Bemore stated she thought KaRon met several of the\n\ncriteria each month but did not “think that [KaRon] hit every single piece of the criteria.”\n\n(Id. at 513.)\n\n       Madewell testified management decided to retain some more experienced workers\n\nwithin Academy Bay so the floor managers would be assigned seasoned as well as new\n\nspecialists. At least ten collectors were in Academy Bay when it closed at the end of\n\n                                               - 19 -\n\fDecember 2004. Three of the collectors had been employed longer than KaRon -- Vince\n\nBrinkley, Judy Riley and Kathy Norton. Brinkley was listed as the number one Academy\n\nBay employee on one of the report cards introduced by KaRon and number three on\n\nanother. Riley was listed as number two.\n\n      After careful review of the evidence, we must conclude KaRon failed to show she\n\nwas treated differently than other employees in regards to her promotion or that the\n\nbusiness reasons proffered by Cavalry were pretext. While KaRon demonstrated she was\n\nvery successful in some aspects of her work, she simply did not prove she had met the\n\ngraduation criteria in a single month. There was no testimony or documentary evidence\n\ndemonstrating other employees had graduated without meeting all the criteria. In\n\naddition, KaRon’s exhibits demonstrated that equally qualified employees, such as\n\nBrinkley, also remained in Academy Bay through December 2004. Although Bunch told\n\nOrlando he believed KaRon was the best worker in Academy Bay, there is no evidence\n\nBunch was involved with Academy Bay decisions or that he knew the relative abilities of\n\nall the Academy Bay employees.\n\n                    (2) Commission Rates\n\n       KaRon claimed Cavalry’s discrimination against her also included the lowering of\n\nher commission rate after she had made arrangements for payments. She introduced\n\nprintouts of accounts in which her commission rate was lowered from its original level.\n\nHowever, Mitchell and Bemore testified they too had commissions on paying accounts\n\nlowered; some were changed back but others were not. Bemore stated if the employee\n\nnotifies his manager and there was a mistake, the rate was changed back. KaRon then\n\n                                              - 20 -\n\fasked: “Have you ever heard of anyone at Cavalry other than myself have a commission\n\nrate changed and nobody change it back to the previous commission rate?” (Vol. II at\n\n502.) Bemore responded: “To my knowledge, they’re supposed to be changed back . . . .\n\nAs an employee now, I notify my direct report which is Andrew Brown and he sends an\n\ne-mail and then he gets back with me and then it’s rectified.” (Id.)\n\n       Mitchell and Brown reiterated commissions were changed on paying deals and the\n\nemployee must bring the problem to the attention of a manager, who would then check\n\nwith the Phoenix office to determine the reason for the change. KaRon presented no\n\ntestimony that she requested Shaw investigate a commission change and even KaRon’s\n\nquestions did not imply she asked to have her commissions reinstated to their original\n\nlevel. Moreover, many of the exhibits showing a decreased commission occurred while,\n\naccording to Orlando, his wife was getting along well in Shaw’s unit. Thus, the jury was\n\ngiven no factual basis to reasonably conclude KaRon was treated differently than other\n\nsimilarly situated employees when her commission rate changed or that the business\n\nreason for the change was pretext.\n\n                     (3) Number and Quality of KaRon’s Accounts\n\n       KaRon claimed she was given fewer and less workable accounts than others after\n\nthe Torres incident. Vince Brinkley testified on one occasion, at some point in time,\n\nKaRon showed him she had only 79 accounts in her queue. Brinkley stated the number\n\nwas not appropriate and he had no less than 800 to 900 accounts in his queue. Orlando\n\nrecounted a manager’s meeting he attended when Bemore told Madewell KaRon did not\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 21 -\n\fhave any accounts.10 When Orlando asked why, Madewell told him “well, I did it for a\n\nreason but I’ll talk to you about it later.” (Id. at 887.) In addition, Orlando stated his\n\nwife had shown him accounts missing from her queue with Bemore’s initials on them,\n\nimplying Bemore somehow inappropriately moved these accounts.\n\n       Gregory Mitchell testified the Robinsons complained to him that KaRon was not\n\ntreated fairly in the distribution of accounts and Bemore was not properly scanning\n\nKaRon’s ACH accounts into the system. Mitchell reported these complaints to Brown\n\nand Warren, but he did not recall what happened to the reports.\n\n       KaRon submitted several printouts showing the number of her accounts on four\n\ndates while she worked in Shaw’s unit. The printouts showed: on January 28, 2005,\n\nKaRon had a total of 218 accounts; on January 31, 2005, a total of 191 accounts; on\n\nFebruary 2, 2005, a total of 190 accounts; on February 3, 2005, a total of 147 accounts;\n\nand, on April 13, 2005, a total of 211 accounts. Mitchell testified it would be possible for\n\na specialist to hit her goal with these numbers but unlikely if the accounts were less than\n\n$500.00. Kari Kiger testified that when she worked with KaRon in Shaw’s unit, KaRon\n\nasked Shaw for more accounts because she only had 300. Kiger said Cavalry managers\n\nhad said “they could get [accounts] for [Kiger] personally” if she “didn’t have enough\n\naccounts.” (Vol. II at 861.) However, “to [Kiger’s] knowledge” nothing was done about\n\nKaRon’s number of accounts. (Id. at 858.)\n\n\n       10\n         One may wonder why Bemore would notify Madewell that KaRon needed\nmore accounts if Bemore was deliberately reducing her accounts to insure KaRon’s\nfailure.\n\n\n                                                - 22 -\n\f       KaRon also claimed Bemore discriminated against her by returning unworkable\n\naccounts to her queue. KaRon submitted 52 printouts of her computer screen showing\n\naccounts she had “exhausted” as uncollectible which Bemore returned to her queue to\n\n“rework” between the end of November through December 2004. Orlando testified that\n\non “several” of those accounts “[t]here was nothing more that could be done with the\n\naccount and they were given back to [KaRon]. There were bankruptcies that legally we\n\ncannot call, deceased accounts, people who are dead, you can’t collect[] from them\n\nbecause they are deceased.” (Id. at 888.)\n\n       Cavalry maintained the managers at the Tulsa office did not participate in the\n\ndistribution of accounts. Brown, Shaw, Madewell and Kiger all testified the number of\n\nnew accounts for each specialist was determined by the Phoenix office.11 While Shaw\n\nstated he believed Warren had access to distribute accounts “at one time,” he did not\n\ntestify when this occurred. (Id. at 716.) Orlando testified “at one particular time\n\n[disbursement] did get switched to Phoenix, but when I was there at one time this Tulsa\n\noffice had control of distribution.” (Id. at 896.) Neither Orlando nor Shaw testified Tulsa\n\ndistributed the accounts from October 2004 through April 2005, the time period KaRon\n\nclaims she was discriminated against.\n\n       Testimony regarding who had the ability to transfer accounts after assignment\n\nwas, at best, confusing. It is uncontested the managers could move accounts back to a\n\nspecialist to rework. Madewell marked one of KaRon’s accounts for “rework.” (Id. at\n\n       11\n         Brinkley was unsure, but assumed the Tulsa office distributed the accounts\nbecause “someone has to do it.” (Id. at 853.)\n\n\n                                               - 23 -\n\f977.) Upper Tulsa management—Brown, Warren and Madewell—could also request\n\nmore accounts from Phoenix for specialists. It appears at least one Tulsa employee could\n\nmove an account upon request from upper management for the purpose of assigning\n\nrelated accounts or for other business reasons. It was uncontested the number of accounts\n\nin a queue could change daily or even within the same day. Specialists could exhaust an\n\naccount or move it to the Spanish bin.12 Affording every reasonable inference in favor of\n\nKaRon, the jury could reasonably believe, at least on certain dates, KaRon received fewer\n\naccounts than her colleagues because upper management was not acting as forcefully on\n\nher behalf as it did for other specialists.13\n\n       The next question is whether KaRon provided evidence that the managers’ failure\n\nto secure more accounts for KaRon altered the terms and conditions of her employment.\n\nOrlando opined he never had less than 500 accounts and “unless you have an adequate\n\nnumber of accounts, you cannot hit your goal consistently . . . . [I]t’s impossible.” (Id. at\n\n882.) But KaRon did not submit evidence regarding her salary, the amount she made on\n\ncommission or her ability to meet her monthly goals. She did produce disciplinary\n\n\n       12\n           By unilaterally moving an account to the Spanish bin, a specialist could\nartificially reduce the number of accounts in their queue.\n       13\n          KaRon would have us conclude that the fact the Phoenix office assigned the\naccounts “only serves to underscore the fact that upper management, including Todd\nTipton of the Phoenix office, was in on the decision to, together with Madewell and\nBemore, intentionally discriminate against [KaRon].” (Appellee’s Response Br. at 38.)\nThis conclusion would be based solely on speculation. There is no evidence Phoenix\nmanagement, other than Tipton in Human Resources, knew about the Torres incident and\nno evidence Tipton had any connection to the account distribution department. KaRon\npresented no evidence of conspiracy between the Tulsa and Phoenix offices.\n\n\n                                                - 24 -\n\freports of verbal warnings given to three other workers for failing to maintain their\n\ncollections at an acceptable level but no similar reports on her performance. In addition,\n\nKaRon presented no evidence showing the number of exhausted accounts returned to her\n\nqueue were larger than the number returned to other employees. Because KaRon failed\n\nto provide evidence that the number of accounts in her queue changed the terms and\n\nconditions of her employment, she failed to submit evidence sufficient to establish her\n\nprima facie case.\n\n       3.

Looking at the period of time from October 21, 2004, through December 30,\n\n2004, while KaRon was in Academy Bay, Vince Brinkley testified it seemed Bemore and\n\nKaRon were “okay” but “all of a sudden” there were “quite a few incidents.” (R. Vol. II\n\nat 852.) He said he “kind of felt” like Bemore treated KaRon more harshly than other\n\nemployees and, on one occasion, told KaRon to “sit down and shut up.” (Id. at 841, 852.)\n\nIn addition, Brinkley testified Madewell would not answer KaRon’s question at an\n\nemployee meeting even after another employee said “[KaRon] has a question.” (Id. at\n\n842.) Brinkley stated Madewell “made a reference to [KaRon] being stupid or something\n\nlike that.” (Id.)\n\n       KaRon claimed Bemore unfairly gave her a written disciplinary action on\n\nNovember 18, 2004. Brown explained he called a meeting with KaRon on November 17,\n\n2004, which Bemore and Warren attended. Bemore was told KaRon was taking her\n\naccounts to Orlando to work for her. At that time, the employees on the floor had\n\nadditional tools to work an account that were unavailable in Academy Bay. Brown told\n\nKaRon she could not ask her husband to work her accounts. He separately told Orlando\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\fhe could do “a second talk-off,”14 but could not work KaRon’s accounts as it would give\n\nher an unfair advantage. (Id. at 1066.)\n\n       After the meeting KaRon moved her workspace, which had been located next to\n\nBemore’s, to another cubicle farther away from Bemore. The managers called KaRon\n\nback in because a work station could not be moved without advance permission. The\n\nmeeting took place in a glass conference room which could be seen by other employees.\n\nDuring this meeting, KaRon became visibly upset and left. She called her husband in\n\ntears and told him to bring her the keys in the break room. Orlando testified KaRon told\n\nhim she had been “ambushed,” and to let Bemore know she was outside and could not\n\nreturn to work. (Id. at 874) Orlando testified he did so and Bemore “offered to clock her\n\nout.” The next day, Bemore gave KaRon a written reprimand for moving her workstation\n\nwithout permission and for leaving work without notifying her supervisor. Bemore\n\ntestified Cavalry’s policy required an employee to give notice directly to the supervisor\n\nbefore leaving early from work. In response, KaRon submitted a report recounting an\n\nincident during Torres’s employment when Torres’s wife brought a note stating he was ill\n\nbut Bemore did not reprimand Torres for failing to call.\n\n       Kiger testified there were two instances when she heard negative comments\n\nregarding the Robinsons. The timing of these statements was not established. The first\n\ncomment was made by an unidentified male employee who continues to work at Cavalry.\n\n\n       14\n         Employees were encouraged to assist each other when a debtor was recalcitrant\nabout payment. Often a second voice may be persuasive, “especially male versus\nfemale.” (Vol. II at 1066.)\n\n\n                                              - 27 -\n\fKiger stated he said, “I personally wouldn’t do that [inter-racial marriage] myself but if\n\nthat makes them happy, good.” (Id. at 859.) Kiger described the situation as follows:\n\n“[Y]ou know, otherwise he wasn’t condoning your relationship as you being married but\n\nhe wasn’t going to say that it, he was sugar-coating it . . . I don’t know why he wouldn’t\n\nwant you to be married, but for the type of jokes the person makes, I would say it would\n\nprobably be racial.” (Id. at 859-60.) Kiger also testified, “[a]t some point in time\n\n[Bemore made] a comment to [Kiger] that [Kiger] felt was inappropriate due to [the\n\nRobinsons’] interracial relationship.” (Id. at 861-62.) Kiger did not reveal what Bemore\n\nsaid nor did Kiger testify she relayed these comments to KaRon.\n\n       KaRon was transferred to Shaw’s unit less than three months after the Torres\n\nincident and did not thereafter associate with Bemore. Kiger testified Shaw was\n\noccasionally unavailable, “condescending” and “overbearing” to KaRon but she never\n\nsaw Shaw directly intimidate KaRon. (Id. at 862.). Other employees also complained\n\nabout Shaw’s supervision. Orlando testified Shaw was not “hostile” to KaRon “until\n\ntowards the end.” (Id. at 891.) He did not testify how Shaw was hostile.\n\n       Even when viewing these circumstances with all favorable inferences to KaRon’s\n\nclaims the evidence revealed, at most, an unpleasant work environment. Bemore and\n\nMadewell were rude on one occasion. Bemore, known as a harsh supervisor, picked on\n\nKaRon. However, on cross-examination, Orlando confirmed no one ever made a\n\nnegative comment to him about the racial difference between him and his wife. He\n\nconceded he never complained that he felt like he was being treated unfairly because of\n\nhis race and neither Bemore nor Madewell made any comments which would indicate\n\n                                               - 28 -\n\fthere was a problem with the fact he was married to a white woman. It is further\n\nuncontested that neither KaRon nor her husband told upper management or the human\n\nresources department that KaRon believed she was being discriminated against because\n\nof her marriage.\n\n       Without discriminatory overtones, discourteous treatment is simply not sufficient\n\nto impose liability under Title VII. See Chavez, 397 F.3d at 833. (“Title VII is not a code\n\nof workplace conduct . . . a hostile environment claim requires a showing not only of\n\nsevere and pervasive harassment, but of severe and pervasive harassment based on\n\n[race].”). While KaRon may have believed Bemore was unfair, “this court’s obligation is\n\nnot to mandate that certain individuals work on their interpersonal skills and cease\n\nengaging in inter-departmental personality conflicts.” Somoza v. Univ. of Denver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"170111\"><a href=\"/opinion/170111/somoza-v-university-of-denver/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1218 (10th Cir. 2008); see also MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1280 (courts “should\n\nfilter out complaints attacking the ordinary tribulations of the workplace”).15\n\n\n       15\n          The jury’s conclusion to the contrary is not surprising given KaRon’s questions\nand comments during the trial. KaRon did not testify, but instead accused the witnesses\nof discriminatory behavior in her questions, implying she had personal knowledge the\nCavalry witnesses were lying when they denied the accusations. For example, the\nfollowing colloquy took place during KaRon’s direct examination of Bemore:\n\n       Q.     [O]n November 17th, could you please explain to the jury what\n              happened on that day?\n\n       A.     What day is that?\n\n       Q.     The day we had a one-on-one meeting and you had told me that I\n              wasn’t allowed to be seen or speak to my husband, even on breaks\n              and lunches, because it made other people uncomfortable?\n\n       A.     I didn’t tell you that.\n\n\n                                               - 29 -\n\f       Because the evidence at trial failed to establish KaRon engaged in protected\n\nopposition to a discriminatory employment practice or that she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action, the district court erred in denying Cavalry’s request for judgment as\n\na matter of law. In light of our ruling on the hostile work environment claim, we are\n\nconfident that the district court was correct in not allowing Ms. Robinson’s constructive\n\ndischarge claim to go to the jury.

U.S. Dep’t of Labor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168767\"><a href=\"/opinion/168767/hall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">847</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 851 (10th\n\nCir. 2007) (“A constructive discharge claim based on a hostile work environment goes a\n\nstep farther. An employee is constructively discharged when the employer by his illegal\n\ndiscriminatory acts makes ‘working conditions so difficult that a reasonable person in the\n\nemployee’s position would feel compelled to resign.’” (citing Sanchez v.

Weld County, Colo., No.\n\n\n(R. Vol. II at 566-67.) During Shaw’s testimony:\n\n       Q.     Did you find it necessary to pull all married couples apart at the\n              same time and put them in separate meetings?\n\n       A.     I didn’t pull any married couples apart.\n\n(Id. at 735.). During Brown’s testimony she inferred he was lying when he said Kiger\nhad not come to him to relate derogatory comments about her marriage. (Id. at 677.) In\nfact, Kiger never testified she went to Brown. KaRon also asked Mitchell, “Did you ever\ntell anyone at Cavalry you were going to lie during your deposition?” (Id. at 979.) These\nare just a few examples of the type of “testimony” KaRon was able to present to the jury.\n\n       While the court gave a proper cautionary instruction, the mere volume of\nallegations repeated in the questions (and not substantiated through testimony or other\nevidence) would have been nearly impossible for the jury to ignore. In fact, no evidence\nof damages was presented at the first trial other than one comment made as an\nafterthought in KaRon’s closing. She stated, “I forgot this earlier but the back pay that is\nowed to me after what I made in Nevada is $158,000 for the past two years.” (Id. at\n1118). No other evidence was presented at trial. The jury awarded her $150,001.\n\n\n                                               - 30 -\n\f08-1365, Slip. Op. at 26 n.6 (10th Cir. Feb. 8, 2010) (“Because Ms. Johnson’s facts fail to\n\nmeet the threshold required for a retaliation claim — a material adverse harm — it\n\nfollows that those same facts cannot satisfy the higher threshold required for a\n\nconstructive discharge claim.”) Given our conclusion, we deem the remaining issues on\n\nappeal moot.\n\n         REVERSED and REMANDED for entry of judgment in accordance with this\n\norder.\n\n                                          Entered by the Court:\n\n                                          Terrence L.
