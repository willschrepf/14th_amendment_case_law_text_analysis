We reverse.\n\n                  PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2     Western Tradition Partnership (WTP), Champion Painting and Montana Shooting\n\nSports Foundation (MSSF) sued the Montana Attorney General and the Commissioner of\n\nPolitical Practices seeking a declaration that § 13-35-227(1), MCA, violated their\n\nfreedom of speech protected by the United States and Montana Constitutions by\n\nprohibiting political expenditures by corporations on behalf of or opposing candidates for\n\npublic office. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment along with briefs\n\nand supporting materials.      The District Court declared the statute unconstitutional,\n\ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and denied summary judgment to the State\n\ndefendants. The District Court enjoined enforcement of the statute and denied the motion\n\nof Champion and MSSF for an award of attorney fees. The State appeals the order of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and Champion and MSSF cross-appeal from\n\nthe denial of their request for attorney fees.\n\n                               STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n¶3     This Court reviews a district court’s decision on summary judgment using the\n\nsame standards as the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. Where there are cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment and the district court is not called upon to resolve factual\n\n                                           3\n\fissues, but only to draw conclusions of law, we review to determine whether those\n\nconclusions are correct. Bud-Kal v. City of Kalispell, 2009 MT 93, ¶ 15, 350 Mont. 25,\n\n204 P.3d 738. Accordingly, a moving party is entitled to summary judgment when there\n\nare no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. Town & Country Foods v. City of Bozeman, 2009 MT 72, ¶ 12, 349 Mont.\n\n453, 203 P.3d 1283. Statutes enjoy a presumption of constitutionality, and a decision on\n\nthe constitutionality of a statute is subject to plenary review. City of Billings v. Albert,\n\n2009 MT 63, ¶ 11, 349 Mont. 400, 203 P.3d 828.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n¶4     Section 13-35-227, MCA, was originally enacted as an initiative by the Montana\n\nvoters in 1912. It provides:\n\n              (1) A corporation may not make a contribution or an expenditure in\n       connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or\n       opposes a candidate or a political party.\n              (2) A person, candidate or political committee may not accept or\n       receive a corporate contribution described in subsection (1).\n              (3)    This section does not prohibit the establishment or\n       administration of a separate segregated fund to be used for making political\n       contributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary\n       contributions solicited from an individual who is a shareholder, employee\n       or member of the corporation.\n              (4) A person who violates this section is subject to the civil penalty\n       provisions of 13-37-128.\n\nSection 13-37-128, MCA, provides the sanction for a violation of § 13-35-227, MCA,\n\nand allows the Commissioner of Political Practices to recover a civil penalty up to $500\n\nor triple the amount of the unlawful expenditure. A corporation may establish a separate\n\nsegregated fund called a political committee or PAC to make political expenditures “if\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthe fund consists of only voluntary contributions solicited from an individual who is a\n\nshareholder, employee, or member of the corporation. Section 13-35-227(3), MCA.\n\nMontana law requires that all political communications must include the name and\n\naddress of the person or entity that paid for the communication. Section 13-35-225,\n\nMCA.\n\n¶5     Champion Painting, Inc., is incorporated under the laws of Montana. It is a single\n\nproprietor painting and drywall business with no employees or members, and its sole\n\nshareholder is Kenneth Champion. It is the only business corporation in this action. Mr.\n\nChampion is personally active in county and state politics, supporting and opposing\n\ncandidates through blogs, letters to the editor, and speeches. Champion states that he\n\nwants to speak on political issues as a spokesman for his corporation and wants to spend\n\ncorporation funds to independently support or oppose candidates. He believes that doing\n\nso would be prohibited by § 13-35-227(1), MCA.\n\n¶6     MSSA is a voluntary association of persons who support and promote firearm\n\nsafety, shooting sports, education, shooting facilities and Second Amendment rights. It\n\nwas incorporated in 1990 to provide liability shelter for its officers and directors. It has\n\nno employees or shareholders and its funding comes primarily from member dues and\n\ndonations from other organizations. MSSA is led by its founder Gary Marbut, who is\n\nactive in Montana politics on behalf of the Association. He and the MSSA have operated\n\na political committee under Montana law for over ten years and publicize its grading and\n\nendorsements of political candidates in state and national elections. Marbut believes that\n\nthe MSSA “has a political presence in Montana, and a political reputation that carries\n\n                                         5\n\fsome weight with the Montana public by virtue of our long history of activism in\n\nMontana.” Nonetheless Marbut wants to use MSSA member dues to support or oppose\n\ncandidates and believes that § 13-35-227(1), MCA, prohibits MSSA from doing so.\n\n¶7     Western Tradition Partnership is an entity incorporated in Colorado in 2008 and\n\nregistered to do business in Montana. WTP reveals no more than that about itself in this\n\ncase. Evidence presented by the State in District Court and not refuted by WTP is that its\n\npurpose is to act as a conduit of funds for persons and entities including corporations who\n\nwant to spend money anonymously to influence Montana elections. WTP seeks to make\n\nunlimited expenditures in Montana elections from these anonymous funding sources.\n\nWTP’s operation is premised on the fact, or at least the assumption, that its independent\n\nexpenditures have a determinative influence on the outcome of elections in Montana.\n\n¶8     Upon the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, the District Court considered\n\nwhether § 13-35-227(1), MCA, violates the First Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution to the extent that it restricts WTP, MSSA or Champion from making\n\nindependent corporate expenditures on behalf of candidates.1 The District Court applied\n\nCitizens United v. F.E.C., 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010) and determined that §\n\n13-35-227(1), MCA, impacts the corporations’ political speech protected by the United\n\nStates Constitution.    The District Court then considered whether the State had\n\ndemonstrated a compelling interest for the restriction on speech, and whether the\n\nrestriction is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. While it answered both questions\n\n1\n Under Montana law corporations are allowed to make independent expenditures on\nballot issues. Montana Chamber of Commerce v. Argenbright, 226 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir.\n2000).\n                                         6\n\fin the negative, the District Court did not conduct a detailed analysis of the compelling\n\ninterest question.   Instead, it concluded that “Citizens United is unequivocal:        the\n\ngovernment may not prohibit independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political\n\nspeech.” (Quoting Minn. Chamber of Comm. v. Gaertner, 710 F. Supp. 2d 868 (D. Minn.\n\n2010)). The District Court specifically did not address whether § 13-35-227, MCA,\n\nviolated the Montana Constitution, and further noted that the decision had “no effect on\n\ndirect corporate contributions to candidates or to any existing or future disclosure laws\n\nthat might be enacted.” Those aspects of Montana law are therefore not at issue in this\n\ncase.\n\n¶9      We take note that Western Tradition appears to be engaged in a multi-front attack\n\non both contribution restrictions and the transparency that accompanies campaign\n\ndisclosure requirements. In addition to this case, it is currently engaged in separate\n\nlitigation in the same District Court involving the Montana laws on campaign spending\n\ndisclosures. Western Tradition Partnership v. Gallik, Cause BDV 2010-1120 (Mont. 1st\n\nJud. Dist. Ct.).2 In another action filed in United States District Court in September,\n\n2011, WTP, under its new name of American Tradition Partnership, and with others,\n\nchallenges the constitutionality of most of the limits and disclosure requirements\n\ncontained in § 13-37-216, MCA. Lair, et al., v. Gallik, et al., United States District Court\n\n\n2\n  In a decision in October, 2010, the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices found\nthat WTP had created a sham organization through which to channel campaign funds, and\nthat its arguments to the contrary were deceptive. The Commissioner further concluded\nthat WTP’s failure to register as a political committee and to disclose the true source and\ndisposition of the funds it raised “frustrates the purpose of Montana’s Campaign Finance\nand Practices Act [and] raises the specter of corruption of the electoral process. . . . ”\n                                         7\n\ffor the District of Montana, Billings Division. Ironically, perhaps, WTP argued in the\n\nDistrict Court and in its oral presentation to this Court on appeal that their compliance\n\nwith these same disclosure laws that it now seeks to invalidate should remedy any\n\nconcerns regarding the potential corrupting influence of its unlimited corporate\n\nexpenditures.\n\n¶10    The District Court erroneously construed and applied the Citizens United case.\n\nThat case considered the constitutionality of Federal statutes and regulations that\n\nprohibited corporations from “electioneering” (making a communication that refers to a\n\nclearly identified candidate for Federal office) within 30 days of a primary election or 60\n\ndays of a general election.\n\n¶11    Citizens United was a case decided upon its facts, and involved “unique and\n\ncomplex” rules that affected 71 distinct entities and included separate rules for 33\n\ndifferent types of speech in Federal elections.       Since 1975, the Federal Election\n\nCommission adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanatory materials, and\n\n1,771 advisory opinions to implement and enforce the Federal law. The FEC adopted a\n\ntwo-part, 11-factor test in response to the holding in a single Supreme Court decision. If\n\nparties want to avoid litigation and possible penalties they must either refrain from\n\npolitical speech or seek an advisory opinion. All of this, the Supreme Court found,\n\nallows the FEC to “select what political speech is safe for public consumption by\n\napplying ambiguous tests.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 895-96. The Court determined\n\nthat the law was “an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 897.\n\n                                         8\n\f¶12    A premise of Citizens United was that First Amendment protections extend to\n\ncorporations. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899. The Court additionally determined that\n\nthe option for a corporation to spend through a separate PAC was not a sufficient\n\nalternative because of the burdensome, extensive, and expensive Federal regulations that\n\napplied.   The Federal law allowed corporations to form a separate segregated fund\n\n(sometimes called a political action committee or PAC) as long as the funds were limited\n\nto donations from stockholders or, in the case of unions, its members. The Court found\n\nthe regulations governing the organization of PACs to be “onerous” restrictions that\n\nmight not allow a corporation to establish a PAC in time to make its views known in a\n\ncurrent campaign.    Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898. Therefore, because the Federal\n\nlaws and regulations severely restricted speech, their constitutionality could be\n\nmaintained only upon a showing that they further a compelling governmental interest\n\nand are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\n¶13    The Court found that the Government did not claim that corporate expenditures\n\nhad actually corrupted the political process and concluded that “independent\n\nexpenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909. However, if elected\n\nofficials do succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures, “then surely\n\nthere is cause for concern.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n¶14    The Court determined that the government had not provided a compelling interest\n\nto justify the speech restrictions at issue. The Court considered and rejected arguments\n\nthat preventing the distorting effect of large expenditures; preventing corruption or the\n\n                                          9\n\fappearance of corruption; or protection of dissenting shareholders were sufficient\n\ninterests to support the Federal restrictions. Therefore, finding no compelling interest for\n\nthe Federal restrictions on corporate political speech through independent expenditures,\n\nthe Court found an impermissible contravention of the First Amendment.             Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n¶15    While Citizens United was decided under its facts or lack of facts, 3 it applied the\n\nlong-standing rule that restrictions upon speech are not per se unlawful, but rather may be\n\nupheld if the government demonstrates a sufficiently strong interest. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 898; Federal Election Comm. v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 251-\n\n52, 107 S. Ct. 616, 624 (1986); Bluman v. Federal Election Commission, 2011 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 86971 (D. D.C. 2011) (upholding Federal ban against campaign contributions by\n\nforeign citizens). The Supreme Court in Citizens United applied the highest level of\n\nscrutiny to the restrictions at issue there, requiring the government to demonstrate a\n\ncompelling interest, although the level of evidence needed to satisfy heightened scrutiny\n\nwill vary with the “novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.” Nixon v. Shrink\n\nMissouri Government PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 391, 120 S. Ct. 897, 906 (2000). Therefore,\n\nthe factual record before a court is critical to determining the validity of a governmental\n\nprovision restricting speech.       The Dissents assert that Citizens United holds\n\nunequivocally that no sufficient government interest justifies limits on political speech.\n\nWe disagree. The Supreme Court held that laws that burden political speech are subject\n\n\n3\n  The Court noted, for example, the “scant evidence” of the effects of independent\nexpenditures. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910.\n                                         10\n\fto strict scrutiny, which requires the government to prove that the law furthers a\n\ncompelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to that interest. The Court, citing\n\nWisconsin Right to Life v. FEC, 551 U.S. 449, 464, 127 S. Ct. 2652, 2663-64 (2007),\n\nclearly endorsed an analysis of restrictions on speech, placing the burden upon the\n\ngovernment to establish a compelling interest. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898. Here\n\nthe government met that burden.\n\n¶16   In this case both sides moved the District Court for summary judgment. The WTP\n\nparties conducted no discovery in the case and presented two brief affidavits, one from\n\nthe MSSF and one from Mr. Champion in support of summary judgment. The State\n\npresented a more extensive record consisting of the deposition transcripts of both Mr.\n\nChampion and Mr. Marbut of the MSSF, along with seven affidavits and attached\n\nexhibits. The plaintiffs did not contest any of this evidence. Nonetheless, the District\n\nCourt failed to give adequate consideration to the record in determining whether the State\n\nhad demonstrated a compelling interest for the restrictions imposed by § 13-35-227(1),\n\nMCA. We do so now because, unlike Citizens United, this case concerns Montana law,\n\nMontana elections and it arises from Montana history.\n\n¶17   First, the depositions of Marbut (on behalf of MSSF) and Champion demonstrate\n\nthat both have been very active politically in Montana on a range of issues that concern\n\nthem. Neither could demonstrate any material way in which Montana law hindered or\n\ncensored their political activity or speech. Mr. Marbut, on behalf of MSSF, has been an\n\nactive fixture in Montana politics and in the legislative process for many years. He stated\n\nthat he believed that while Montana law allowed MSSF to obtain and spend donations\n\n                                        11\n\ffrom other organizations on political activities, it did not allow MSSF to use dues paid by\n\nits members for the same purposes. No such distinction appears in Montana law, and the\n\naffidavit of the Commissioner of Political Practices affirms his construction of Montana\n\nlaw that it places no such restriction on MSSF. MSSF, therefore, failed to demonstrate\n\nthat its speech was impaired by the statute.\n\n¶18    Similarly, Mr. Champion described his many political activities both on a local\n\nand state level. He affirmed that he regularly speaks, blogs, and meets with others, and\n\nhas run for public office. His complaint was that he believed that Montana law prohibits\n\nhim from telling his audiences and readers that his company, Champion Painting, also\n\nsupports his views. Mr. Champion believes that a candidate endorsement by “Champion\n\nPainting, Inc.” would be more persuasive than his personal endorsement, and that if his\n\nbusiness spends money on political events he will enjoy “tax benefits.” However, in\n\nChampion’s case he is the sole shareholder and derives his livelihood from the money he\n\npays himself from the corporation.        While the statute forbids the expenditure of\n\nChampion Painting’s corporate funds to support or oppose candidates, the burden upon\n\nKenneth Champion, as a sole shareholder, to establish a political committee to advocate\n\nfor his corporation’s interests and expend funds that he will decide to contribute, are\n\nparticularly minimal. We conclude, under these facts, Champion’s political speech was\n\nsimilarly not materially impacted by the statute.\n\n¶19    WTP, as noted, has been terse in its explanations of its organization, funding,\n\nactivities, and intent. It claims to be a foreign corporation but it is not a business\n\ncorporation. Its purpose, according to un-rebutted evidence submitted to the District\n\n                                         12\n\fCourt by the State, is to solicit and anonymously spend the funds of other corporations,\n\nindividuals and entities to influence the outcome of Montana elections. In a promotional\n\npresentation directed to potential donors, WTP represented:\n\n               There’s no limit to how much you can give. As you know, Montana\n       has very strict limits on contributions to candidates, but there is no limit to\n       how much you can give to this program. You can give whatever you’re\n       comfortable with and make as big of an impact as you wish.\n               Finally, we’re not required to report the name or the amount of any\n       contribution that we receive. So, if you decide to support this program, no\n       politician, no bureaucrat, and no radical environmentalist will ever know\n       you helped make this program possible. The only thing we plan on\n       reporting is our success to contributors like you who can see the benefits of\n       a program like this. You can just sit back on election night and see what a\n       difference you’ve made.\n\nWestern Tradition Partnership, 2010 Election Year Program Executive Briefing.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n¶20    Organizations like WTP that act as conduits for anonymous spending by others\n\nrepresent a threat to the “political marketplace.” Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. at\n\n264, 107 S. Ct. at 631. Echoing that theme, the State presented evidence that WTP has\n\noperated in disregard for and without complying with Montana law, unlike MSSF and\n\nChampion. Because WTP has not disclosed its operation, it is difficult to determine how\n\nit might be impacted by § 13-35-227(1), MCA, but given the evidence presented below\n\nwe will assume there is a direct impact.\n\n¶21    Second, a material factual distinction between the present case and Citizens United\n\nis the extent of the regulatory burden imposed by the challenged law. As noted above,\n\nthe Court in Citizens United emphasized the length, complexity and ambiguity of the\n\n                                           13\n\fFederal restrictions, including the power of the FEC to determine what speech is “safe for\n\npublic consumption,” and the difficulty of establishing a PAC as an alternative to direct\n\ncorporate spending. In contrast, under Montana law a political committee can be formed\n\nand maintained by filing simple and straight-forward forms or reports. (See e.g. §§ 13-\n\n37-201 and -210; 13-35-402, MCA.) Mr. Marbut in his deposition described that MSSF\n\nhas established its own political committees and used them to actively participate in the\n\nMontana political process over a period of years. The evidence submitted by the State in\n\nthe District Court similarly demonstrates that corporations, through their political\n\ncommittees organized under Montana law, are and have been a substantial presence and\n\nactive participants in Montana politics. The many lobbyists and political committees\n\nwho participate in each session of the Montana Legislature bear witness. Under the\n\nundisputed facts here, the political committee is an easily implemented and effective\n\nalternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in political speech. This alternative\n\nis available to any corporation in Montana, and to MSSF and Champion, as well as WTP\n\nshould they choose to comply with existing Montana law. In the case of MSSF the\n\nevidence shows that it has in fact effectively used the political committee form for years\n\nand there is no showing that it could not continue to do so.\n\n¶22    Third, the Montana law at issue in this case cannot be understood outside the\n\ncontext of the time and place it was enacted, during the early twentieth century.\n\n(Montana became a state in 1889.) Those tumultuous years were marked by rough\n\ncontests for political and economic domination primarily in the mining center of Butte,\n\nbetween mining and industrial enterprises controlled by foreign trusts or corporations.\n\n                                         14\n\fThese disputes had profound long-term impacts on the entire State, including issues\n\nregarding the judiciary, the location of the state capitol, the procedure for election of U.S.\n\nSenators, and the ownership and control of virtually all media outlets in the State.\n\n¶23    Examples of well-financed corruption abound. In the fight over mineral rights\n\nbetween entrepreneur F. Augustus Heinze and the Anaconda Company, then controlled\n\nby Standard Oil, Heinze managed to control the two State judges in Butte, who routinely\n\ndecided cases in his favor. K. Ross Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 196-99 (Univ.\n\nof Okla. Press 1959) the Butte judges denied being bribed, but one of them admitted that\n\nAnaconda representatives had offered him $250,000 cash to sign an affidavit that Heinze\n\nhad bribed him. Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 204.\n\n¶24    In response to the legal conflicts with Heinze, in 1903 Anaconda/Standard closed\n\ndown all its industrial and mining operations (but not the many newspapers it controlled),\n\nthrowing 4/5 of the labor force of Montana out of work. Toole, Montana, An Uncommon\n\nLand, 206. Its price for sending its employees back to work was that the Governor call a\n\nspecial session of the Legislature to enact a measure that would allow Anaconda to avoid\n\nhaving to litigate in front of the Butte judges. The Governor and Legislature capitulated\n\nand the statute survives. See e.g. Patrick v. State, 2011 MT 169, ¶¶ 17-23, 361 Mont.\n\n204, 257 P.3d 365.\n\n¶25    W. A. Clark, who had amassed a fortune from the industrial operations in Butte,\n\nset his sights on the United States Senate. In 1899, in the wake of a large number of\n\nsuddenly affluent members, the Montana Legislature elected Clark to the U. S. Senate.\n\nClark admitted to spending $272,000 in the effort and the estimated expense was over\n\n                                          15\n\f$400,000.    Complaints of Clark’s bribery of the Montana Legislature led to an\n\ninvestigation by the U. S. Senate in 1900. The Senate investigating committee concluded\n\nthat Clark had won his seat through bribery and unseated him. The Senate committee\n\n“expressed horror at the amount of money which had been poured into politics in\n\nMontana elections . . . and expressed its concern with respect to the general aura of\n\ncorruption in Montana.” Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 186-94.\n\n¶26    In a demonstration of extraordinary boldness, Clark returned to Montana, caused\n\nthe Governor to leave the state on a ruse and, with assistance of the supportive Lt.\n\nGovernor, won appointment to the very U. S. Senate seat that had just been denied him.\n\nToole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 192-93.             When the Senate threatened to\n\ninvestigate and unseat Clark a second time, he resigned. Clark eventually won his Senate\n\nseat after spending enough on political campaigns to seat a Montana Legislature\n\nfavorable to his candidacy.\n\n¶27   After the Anaconda Company cleared itself of opposition from Heinze and others,\n\nit controlled 90% of the press in the state and a majority of the legislature. C. B.\n\nGlasscock, The War of the Copper Kings, 290 (Grosset & Dunlap, N.Y. 1935). By 1915\n\nthe company, after having acquired all of Clark’s holdings as well as many others,\n\n“clearly dominated the Montana economy and political order . . . [and] local folks now\n\nfound themselves locked in the grip of a corporation controlled from Wall Street and\n\ninsensitive to their concerns.” Michael Malone and Richard Roeder, Montana, a History\n\nof Two Centuries, 176 (Univ. of Wash. Press, Seattle 1976). Even at that time it was\n\nevident that industrial corporations controlled the state “thus converting the state\n\n                                       16\n\fgovernment into a political instrument for the furthering and accomplishment of\n\nlegislation and the execution of laws favorable to the absentee stockholders of the large\n\ncorporations and inimical to the economic interests of the wage earning and farming\n\nclasses who constitute by far the larger percentage of the population in Montana.” Helen\n\nFisk Sanders, History of Montana, Vol. 1, 429-30 (Lewis Pub. Co. 1913).\n\n¶28   In 1900 Clark himself testified in the United States Senate that “[m]any people\n\nhave become so indifferent to voting” in Montana as a result of the “large sums of money\n\nthat have been expended in the state. . . . ” Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 184-\n\n85. This naked corporate manipulation of the very government (Governor and\n\nLegislature) of the State ultimately resulted in populist reforms that are still part of\n\nMontana law. In 1906 the people voted to amend the state Constitution to allow for voter\n\ninitiatives. Not long thereafter, in 1906 this new initiative power was used to enact\n\nreforms including primary elections to choose political candidates; the direct election of\n\nUnited States Senators; and the Corrupt Practices Act, part of which survives as § 13-35-\n\n227, MCA, at issue in this case.\n\n¶29   The State of Montana was still contending with corporate domination even in the\n\nmid-20th century.     For example, the Anaconda Company maintained controlling\n\nownership of all but one of Montana’s major newspapers until 1959. Writing in 1959,\n\nhistorian K. Ross Toole so noted and described the state:\n\n      Today the influence of the Anaconda Company in the state legislature is\n      unspectacular but very great. It has been a long time since the company\n      showed the mailed fist. But no informed person denies its influence or the\n      fact that the basic use to which it is put is to maintain the status quo—to\n\n                                        17\n\f       keep taxes down, not to rock the boat. Few of the company personnel\n       either in Butte or in New York remember F. Augustus Heinze, or even for\n       that matter, [U. S. Senator] Joseph M. Dixon, but it would be foolish for\n       anyone to deny that the pervasive influence of the Anaconda Company in\n       Montana politics is part and parcel of the Montana heritage.\n\nToole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 244. A study of Montana in the early 1970s\n\nconcluded that corporate influence of the Anaconda Company had been “replaced by a\n\ncorporate power structure, with interlocked directorates, the same law firms and common\n\nbusiness interests” among the Anaconda Company, Montana Power Company,\n\nBurlington Northern Railway and the First Bank System. Malone and Roeder, Montana,\n\na History of Two Centuries, 290. History professor Dr. Harry Fritz, in his affidavit\n\npresented in the District Court, affirmed that the “dangers of corporate influence remain\n\nin Montana” because the resources upon which its economy depends in turn depend upon\n\ndistant markets. He affirmed: “What was true a century ago is as true today: distant\n\ncorporate interests mean that corporate dominated campaigns will only work ‘in the\n\nessential interest of outsiders with local interests a very secondary consideration.’”\n\nWhile specific corporate interests come and go in Montana, they are always present.\n\nMontana’s mineral wealth, for example, has historically been exported from the State,\n\nand that is still true today. Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State of Montana, 189 Mont.\n\n191, 196, 615 P.2d 847, 850 (1980), aff’d, 453 U.S. 609, 101 S. Ct. 2946. The corporate\n\npower that can be exerted with unlimited political spending is still a vital interest to the\n\npeople of Montana.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f¶30    Furthermore, in the evidence presented below the State demonstrated aptly how\n\neven small expenditures of money can impact Montana elections. The State submitted\n\naffidavits from two respected and experienced politicians and public servants. Bob\n\nBrown, a Republican, served in the Montana House of Representative, in the Montana\n\nSenate, as the Montana Secretary of State and as an unsuccessful candidate for Governor.\n\nHe retired in 2010 as a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West and the\n\nMansfield Center, at the University of Montana. Mike Cooney, a Democrat, served in the\n\nMontana House of Representatives, in the Montana Senate, as the Montana Secretary of\n\nState, and also as an unsuccessful candidate for Governor. Both affirmed that Montana,\n\nwith its small population, enjoys political campaigns marked by person-to-person contact\n\nand a low cost of advertising compared to other states. They affirmed that allowing\n\nunlimited independent expenditures of corporate money into the Montana political\n\nprocess would drastically change campaigning by shifting the emphasis to raising funds.\n\n¶31    Cooney, for example, ran his first state legislative campaign for $750 as a\n\n“grassroots” effort that he believed could have been derailed by an opposing expenditure\n\nof even a couple of thousand dollars. Brown affirmed that Montana politics are more\n\nsusceptible to corruption than Federal campaigns, and that infusions of large amounts of\n\ncorporate independent expenditure on just media coverage “could accomplish the same\n\ntype of corruption of Montana politics as that which led to the enactment of” § 13-35-\n\n227, MCA. Cooney recounted his experience from his most recent campaign when he\n\nfound that voters were concerned that they “didn’t really count” in the political process\n\nunless they can make a material financial contribution, and that special interests therefore\n\n                                         19\n\fhold sway. This is much the same sentiment described by W. A. Clark to the United\n\nStates Senate committee over a century ago, quoted above.\n\n¶32    The State also presented the affidavit of Edwin Bender of the National Institute on\n\nMoney in State Politics. He confirmed that under Montana law corporations can now\n\nmake unlimited contributions (in amount) for independent expenditures from their\n\ncorporate PACs to support or oppose candidates, directly to ballot measure committees,\n\nand to support or oppose ballot measures, and can make unlimited expenditures on\n\nlobbyists. Corporations can make contributions with the same limits as all donors from\n\ntheir PACs to candidates and to party committees. Bender also affirmed the low cost of\n\npolitical races in Montana, in comparison to other states,4 with all legislative and\n\nstatewide candidates for office raising a total of around $7 million in 2008. In that year\n\nthe average candidate for the Montana House raised $7,475 and the average candidate for\n\nthe Montana Senate raised $13,299. This makes it possible for direct political spending\n\nby corporations to significantly affect the outcome of elections.\n\n¶33    Bender also affirmed that studies of election spending in the United States show\n\nthat the percentage of campaign contributions from individual voters drops sharply from\n\n48% in states with restrictions on corporate spending to 23% in states without. Evidence\n\npresented in the District Court showed that in recent years in Montana, corporate\n\nindependent spending on ballot issues has far exceeded spending from other sources. He\n\nprovided an extensive 2010 joint study by the Hofstra University School of Law, the\n\n\n4\n  Montana is the fourth largest state in size, covering over 145,000 square miles, and has\na population less than one million people.\n                                         20\n\fBrandeis Center at the NYU School of Law and the National Institute on Money in State\n\nPolitics that concluded that polling shows that 3 of 4 Americans believe that campaign\n\ncontributions affect judicial decisions in states where judges are elected.      The New\n\nPolitics of Judicial Elections 2000-2009, Charles Hall ed., Justice at Stake Campaign,\n\n2010.\n\n¶34     Laws that impact speech in some way must be evaluated by using the proper level\n\nof scrutiny. This is determined by the type of speech that the law affects and the type of\n\nburden that the law imposes. Davis v. Fed. Election Comm., 554 U.S. 724, 737, 128 S.\n\nCt. 2759, 2770 (2008). Laws that place severe burdens on fully protected speech are\n\nsubject to strict scrutiny, Arizona Free Enterprise Club v. Bennett, __ U.S. __, 131 S. Ct.\n\n2806, 2816-17 (2011), while laws that place only a minimal burden or that apply to\n\nspeech that is not fully protected receive intermediate scrutiny. Davis, 554 U.S. at 737,\n\n128 S. Ct. at 2771.\n\n¶35     Montana law has long incorporated a requirement of a compelling state interest in\n\nevaluating cases involving claims that governmental action infringes upon constitutional\n\nrights. The Montana Constitution, Art. 2 § 10, expressly incorporates the standard for\n\nevaluating issues affecting the right of individual privacy. Montana Hum. Rights Div. v.\n\nCity of Billings, 199 Mont. 434, 439-40, 649 P.2d 1283, 1286 (1982); St. James Comm.\n\nHosp. v. District Court, 2003 MT 261, ¶ 4, 317 Mont. 419, 77 P.3d 534. Under Montana\n\nlaw the government must demonstrate a compelling interest when it intrudes on a\n\nfundamental right, and determination of a compelling interest is a question of law. State\n\nv. Pastos, 269 Mont. 43, 47, 887 P.2d 199, 202 (1994).\n\n                                        21\n\f¶36    Based upon the background of § 13-35-227(1), MCA, the State of Montana, or\n\nmore accurately its voters, clearly had a compelling interest to enact the challenged\n\nstatute in 1912. At that time the State of Montana and its government were operating\n\nunder a mere shell of legal authority, and the real social and political power was wielded\n\nby powerful corporate managers to further their own business interests. The voters had\n\nmore than enough of the corrupt practices and heavy-handed influence asserted by the\n\nspecial interests controlling Montana’s political institutions. Bribery of public officials\n\nand unlimited campaign spending by the mining interests were commonplace and well\n\nknown to the public. Referring to W. A. Clark, but describing the general state of affairs\n\nin Montana, Mark Twain wrote in 1907 that Clark “is said to have bought legislatures and\n\njudges as other men buy food and raiment. By his example he has so excused and so\n\nsweetened corruption that in Montana it no longer has an offensive smell.” Mark Twain,\n\nMark Twain in Eruption, 72 (Harper & Bros. 1940).\n\n¶37    The question then, is when in the last 99 years did Montana lose the power or\n\ninterest sufficient to support the statute, if it ever did. If the statute has worked to\n\npreserve a degree of political and social autonomy is the State required to throw away its\n\nprotections because the shadowy backers of WTP seek to promote their interests? Does a\n\nstate have to repeal or invalidate its murder prohibition if the homicide rate declines? We\n\nthink not. Issues of corporate influence, sparse population, dependence upon agriculture\n\nand extractive resource development, location as a transportation corridor, and low\n\ncampaign costs make Montana especially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate\n\ncontrol to the detriment of democracy and the republican form of government. Clearly\n\n                                        22\n\fMontana has unique and compelling interests to protect through preservation of this\n\nstatute.\n\n¶38    While Montana has a clear interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral\n\nprocess, it also has an interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana\n\nelectorate. The unrefuted evidence submitted by the State in the District Court through\n\nthe affidavit of Edwin Bender demonstrates that individual voter contributions are\n\ndiminished from 48% of the total raised by candidates in states where a corporate\n\nspending ban has been in place to 23% of the total raised by candidates in states that\n\npermit unlimited corporate spending. The point is illustrative of Montana, a state where\n\ncitizens generally support candidates with modest campaign donations. In the case of\n\nballot issues, where corporations may make unlimited donations, the characteristics of\n\ndonors are markedly different from those who give to candidates. In 2004, for example,\n\n97 institutional donors gave 95% of the total money raised in ballot initiative campaigns,\n\nwhile 760 individual donors accounted for the remaining 5%. Similarly, in 2008, 34\n\ninstitutional donors gave 95% of the total money donated to ballot campaigns. Moreover,\n\nunlimited corporate money would irrevocably change the dynamic of local Montana\n\npolitical office races, which have historically been characterized by the low-dollar, broad-\n\nbased campaigns run by Montana candidates. At present, the individual contribution\n\nlimit for Montana House, Senate and District Court races is $160, and for Supreme Court\n\nelections it is $310. Section 13-37-216, MCA, as adjusted as provided in (4). With the\n\ninfusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or opposition to a targeted candidate,\n\nthe average citizen candidate would be unable to compete against the corporate-\n\n                                         23\n\fsponsored candidate, and Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have made their\n\nmodest election contributions meaningfully count would be effectively shut out of the\n\nprocess.\n\n¶39    Montana also has a compelling interest in protecting and preserving its system of\n\nelected judges. In this State, the people elect the Justices of the Supreme Court, the\n\nJudges of the District Courts, and most lower court judges as well. Mont. Const. art. VII,\n\n§ 8; § 3-2-101, MCA; and § 3-5-201, MCA. Judicial elections are nonpartisan. Section\n\n13-14-111, MCA. When only an incumbent is running for a judicial seat, the voters can\n\napprove or reject the candidate. Mont. Const. art. VII, § 8 (e).\n\n¶40    The people of the State of Montana have a continuing and compelling interest in,\n\nand a constitutional right to, an independent, fair and impartial judiciary. The State has a\n\nconcomitant interest in preserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence\n\nso as to maintain the public’s trust and confidence. In the present case, the free speech\n\nrights of the corporations are no more important than the due process rights of litigants in\n\nMontana courts to a fair and independent judiciary, and both are constitutionally\n\nprotected. The Bill of Rights does not assign priorities as among the rights it guarantees.\n\nNeb. Press Assoc. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 561, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 2803 (1976).\n\n¶41    Clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations creates a dominating impact\n\non the political process and inevitably minimizes the impact of individual citizens. As to\n\ncandidates for political office, § 13-35-227(1), MCA, is designed to further the\n\ncompelling interest of the people of Montana in strong voter participation in the process.\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fWhile corporations have first amendment rights in political speech, they do not have the\n\nvote.\n\n¶42     The importance of and compelling interest in an independent judiciary is reflected\n\nas a matter of policy in Montana’s Code of Judicial Conduct.\n\n        An independent, fair and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system\n        of justice. The United States legal system is based upon the principle that\n        an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and\n        women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our\n        society.\n\nMont. Code of Judicial Conduct, Preamble. Montana expects its judges to act to promote\n\n“public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary” and\n\nto “avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.”         Mont. Code of Judicial\n\nConduct, Rule 1.2. Because it is the duty of a judge to make decisions based upon the\n\nfacts and law of every case, a judge must “to the greatest extent possible, be free and\n\nappear to be free from political influence and political pressure.” Mont. Code of Judicial\n\nConduct, Rule 4.2, Comment [1].          “Public confidence in the independence and\n\nimpartiality of the judiciary is eroded if judges or judicial candidates are perceived to be\n\nsubject to political influence.” Mont. Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 4.2, Comment [3].\n\n¶43     The United States Supreme Court has affirmed the importance of judicial integrity\n\nand in maintaining public respect for the judiciary.\n\n        “Courts, in our system, elaborate principles of law in the course of\n        resolving disputes. The power and the prerogative of a court to perform\n        this function rest, in the end, upon the respect accorded to its judgments.\n        The citizen’s respect for judgments depends in turn upon the issuing court’s\n        absolute probity. Judicial integrity is, in consequence, a state interest of\n        the highest order.” [Emphasis added.]\n\n                                         25\n\fCaperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 558 U.S. 868, ___, 129 S. Ct. 2252, 2266-67\n\n(2009) (quoting Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 122 S. Ct. 2528\n\n(2002)). The Court also recognizes the importance of state codes of judicial conduct,\n\nwhich “serve to maintain the integrity of the judiciary and the rule of law.” Caperton,\n\n558 U.S. at ___, 129 S. Ct. at 2266. States have a “compelling interest” in preventing\n\njudges from activities that “would undermine actual impartiality, as well as its\n\nappearance.” Bauer v. Shepard, 620 F.3d 704, 711 (7th Cir. 2010) (upholding limits on\n\njudges acting in posts of political leadership and delivering political speeches). “The\n\nstate certainly has a compelling state interest in the public’s trust and confidence in the\n\nintegrity of our judicial system.” Simes v. Ark. Judicial Discipline and Disability Comm.,\n\n247 S.W.3d 876, 882 (Ark. 2007).\n\n¶44    Montana judicial elections would be particularly vulnerable to large levels of\n\nindependent spending, both in terms of fairness and in terms of the public perception of\n\nimpartiality. Litigants appearing before a judge elected after a large expenditure of\n\ncorporate funds could legitimately question whether their due process rights were\n\nadversely impacted. In the 2008 contested election for Chief Justice of the Montana\n\nSupreme Court, evidence presented by the State in the District Court indicated that the\n\ntotal expenditure for media advertising was about $60,000. It is clear that an entity like\n\nMassey Coal, willing to spend even hundreds of thousands of dollars, much less millions,\n\non a Montana judicial election could effectively drown out all other voices. The historic\n\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fHeinze-Anaconda conflict noted above illustrates the obvious negative and corrupting\n\neffects of a “bought” judiciary.\n\n¶45    Sandra Day O’Connor recently wrote in her introduction to The New Politics of\n\nJudicial Elections that the “crisis of confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is real\n\nand growing.” The Executive Summary in that same report noted a study of the nation’s\n\nten most costly judicial elections shows the extraordinary spending power of “super\n\nspender groups,” which are mostly corporate funded. Montana is not immune from such\n\ninfluence and has a compelling interest in precluding corporate expenditures on judicial\n\nelections based upon its interest in insuring judicial impartiality and integrity, its interest\n\nin preserving public confidence in the judiciary and its interest in protecting the due\n\nprocess rights of litigants.5\n\n¶46    As discussed above, the statute has no or minimal impact on MSSF and\n\nChampion. Because of this minimal impact, the State is not required to demonstrate a\n\ncompelling interest to support § 13-35-227(1), MCA. It is required only to demonstrate\n\nthe less exacting sufficiently important interest. For the same reasons discussed above\n\nwith regard to the compelling state interest, the statute is clearly supported by important\n\ngovernmental interests. Therefore, as to MSSF and Champion, it passes constitutional\n\nmuster as well.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The State has additionally argued that it has a compelling interest in protecting the\nrights of dissenting shareholders who disagree with the political stance of corporate\nspending. We do not reach that issue because it has not been presented in the factual\nframework of this case.\n                                          27\n\f¶47     Finally, § 13-35-227(1), MCA, is narrowly tailored to meet its objectives. The\n\nstatute only minimally affects entitles like MSSF and Champion. Even if it applies\n\ndirectly to WTP, WTP can still speak through its own political committee/PAC as\n\nhundreds of organizations in Montana do on an ongoing basis. Unlike the Federal law\n\nPACs considered in Citizens United, under Montana law political committees are easy to\n\nestablish and easy to use to make independent expenditures for political speech. As the\n\nBender affidavit submitted by the State in District Court confirms, corporate PACs can\n\nmake unlimited independent expenditures on behalf of candidates. The difference then is\n\nthat under Montana law the PAC has to comply with Montana’s disclosure and reporting\n\nlaws. And as noted earlier, corporations are allowed to contribute to ballot issues in\n\nMontana, which is a significant distinction because ballot issues often have a direct\n\nimpact on corporate business activities within Montana but present less danger of\n\ncorruptive influences that have concerned Montana voters since 1912. The statute only\n\naddresses contributions regarding candidates for state political office.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n¶48    Citizens United does not compel a conclusion that Montana’s law prohibiting\n\nindependent political expenditures by a corporation related to a candidate is\n\nunconstitutional. Rather, applying the principles enunciated in Citizens United, it is clear\n\nthat Montana has a compelling interest to impose the challenged rationally-tailored\n\nstatutory restrictions. We reverse the District Court and enter summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the Montana Attorney General and the Commissioner of Political Practices and\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\fagainst WTP, MSSF and Champion. Consequently, the cross-appeal on the issue of\n\nattorney fees is moot.\n\n\n                                                  /S/ MIKE McGRATH\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n/S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n/S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ JIM RICE\n\n\n\n\nJustice Beth Baker, dissenting.\n\n¶49    I agree with Justice Nelson that we are constrained by Citizens United to declare\n\n§ 13-35-227(1), MCA, unconstitutional to the extent it prohibits independent corporate\n\nexpenditures for political speech. In my view, the State of Montana made no more\n\ncompelling a case than that painstakingly presented in the 90-page dissenting opinion of\n\nJustice Stevens and emphatically rejected by the majority in Citizens United. Though I\n\nbelieve Citizens United requires us to affirm the District Court, we must in any event\n\nanticipate the consequences should the Court’s holding today be reversed. Rather than\n\ninventing distinctions in what I fear will be a vain attempt to rescue Montana’s Corrupt\n\nPractices Act, I would construe the statute in a manner to preserve what remains of its\n\nconstitutionality and to further the legislature’s underlying intent to prevent corruption.\n\n¶50    Citizens United holds unequivocally that “[n]o sufficient governmental interest\n\njustifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” 130 S. Ct.\n                                          29\n\fat 913. Just as unequivocally, however, it allows the government to impose disclaimer\n\nand disclosure requirements on political speech because, while such requirements “may\n\nburden the ability to speak, . . . they ‘impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,’\n\n. . . and ‘do not prevent anyone from speaking[.]’” 130 S. Ct. at 914 (citations omitted).\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged during oral argument that disclosure requirements are\n\nthe means by which to address the State’s compelling interest in preserving the integrity\n\nof the election process. And the Amicus Curiae Brief from the Center for Competitive\n\nPolitics described disclosure mandates as among the “constitutional tools” available to\n\nstates in the wake of Citizens United. In light of Citizens United’s clear directive that the\n\nState cannot prohibit corporate expenditures, our review and construction of the\n\nchallenged statute should focus on preserving disclosure requirements as applied to such\n\nexpenditures in order to protect the overriding interest in preventing corruption.\n\n¶51    This Court attempts to construe statutes in a manner that avoids unconstitutional\n\ninterpretation. Oberson v. USDA, 2007 MT 293, ¶ 14, 339 Mont. 519, 171 P.3d 715. If a\n\nlaw contains both constitutional and unconstitutional provisions, the Court first will\n\nexamine the legislation to determine if there is a severability clause. PPL Mont., LLC v.\n\nState, 2010 MT 64, ¶ 131, 355 Mont. 402, 229 P.3d 421 (citing Finke v. State, 2003 MT\n\n48, ¶ 25, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576). In the absence of such a clause, the Court\n\nconsiders “whether the integrity of [the law] relies upon the unconstitutional provision or\n\nwhether the inclusion of [the] provisions acted as inducement to its enactment.” Finke,\n\n¶ 26. If the unconstitutional provisions are stricken, the law must be complete in itself\n\nand still capable of execution in accord with legislative intent. Finke, ¶ 26. Though “the\n\n                                         30\n\fpresumption is against the mutilation of a statute,” Sheehy v. Pub. Emp. Retirement Div.,\n\n262 Mont. 129, 142, 864 P.2d 762, 770 (1993), if the offending provisions may be\n\nremoved without frustrating the purpose or disrupting the integrity of the law, the Court\n\nwill strike only those provisions of the statute that are unconstitutional. Mont. Auto.\n\nAss’n v. Greely, 193 Mont. 378, 380-81, 632 P.2d 300, 302 (1981).\n\n¶52    Plaintiffs seek a ruling invalidating subsection (1) of § 13-35-227, MCA. That\n\nsubsection prohibits a corporation from making “a contribution or an expenditure in\n\nconnection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate\n\nor a political party.” Subsection (2) of the statute, not challenged here, prohibits a\n\nperson, candidate, or political committee from accepting or receiving a corporate\n\ncontribution.    Subsection (3) of the same statute allows “the establishment or\n\nadministration of a separate, segregated fund to be used for making political contributions\n\nor expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited from an\n\nindividual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation.”\n\n¶53    Section 13-35-227(3), MCA, when read in the context of Montana’s overall\n\ncampaign finance scheme, expresses the legislature’s intent to provide citizens and\n\nshareholders with information about sources of funds used in support of candidates and\n\nballot issues.   Under Citizens United, the State clearly may not require corporate\n\nindependent expenditures to come from a fund consisting only of “voluntary\n\ncontributions” as the language of § 13-35-227(3), MCA, now provides. Subsection (1) of\n\nthe statute still could be preserved by allowing corporate expenditures under that\n\nsubsection to be made from a “separate segregated fund” as prescribed by subsection (3),\n\n                                        31\n\fwithout applying the now-invalid requirement that “the funds consist[] only of voluntary\n\ncontributions.”\n\n¶54    I would therefore hold that the Commissioner constitutionally may extend\n\nMontana’s disclosure and reporting laws to independent expenditures by corporate\n\nentities made on behalf of candidates or political committees, just as the Commissioner\n\nhas done for corporate expenditures on ballot issue campaigns. Without such a holding,\n\nand given that the Montana Legislature will not meet in general session prior to the next\n\nelection, Montana voters may be left in the dark if § 13-35-227(1), MCA, is invalidated\n\nby the nation’s highest court.\n\n¶55    Applying § 13-35-227(3), MCA, in a constitutionally-permitted fashion to\n\nexpenditures from a corporate treasury will further the government’s interest in\n\ndisclosure requirements and will not disrupt the statute’s integrity. As noted by the\n\nMajority, only part of the original Corrupt Practices Act survives in § 13-35-227, MCA.\n\nOpinion, ¶ 28. The statute has been amended numerous times in its 100-year history.\n\nSubsection (3) was added in 1979. 1979 Mont. Laws ch. 404, 1011. The statute’s most\n\nrecent modification was in 2003, after federal courts invalidated the law’s prohibition\n\nagainst corporate contributions and expenditures in ballot issue campaigns.        Mont.\n\nChamber of Com. v. Argenbright, 28 F. Supp. 2d 593, 600-01 (D. Mont. 1998), aff’d, 226\n\nF.3d 1049, 1052 (9th Cir. 2000). Although neither the original Act nor most of its\n\namendments have included a severability clause, applying the statute in the fashion I\n\nsuggest is consistent with the Finke analysis.\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f¶56      Through the years, while legislative history is scant, the legislature’s palpable\n\nintent was to prevent corruption in Montana elections. Opinion, ¶¶ 22-28. Prohibition of\n\ncorporate contributions has been one means to achieve that goal; disclosure has been\n\nanother.    State Senator Miles Romney, sponsor of the 1975 amendment that first\n\nintroduced the ban on corporate spending in ballot issue campaigns, commented in part\n\nthat “everyone should know who is giving how much” and statements of contributions\n\nwould facilitate that knowledge. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., Hearing on SB 97, at 5 (Mar. 7,\n\n1975).     Through its various iterations, inducement for the legislation has been the\n\nlegislature’s desire to prevent corruption in elections. Absent constitutional authority for\n\nan outright ban on corporate spending, prohibiting application of the “voluntary\n\ncontributions” clause to expenditures made under subsection (1) will further, not\n\nfrustrate, the accountability that fosters prevention of corruption.\n\n¶57      Construing the statute to preserve its requirement for a separate segregated fund\n\nfrom which corporate expenditures are made will facilitate disclosure under requirements\n\npromulgated by the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices. The Affidavit of\n\nDennis Unsworth, submitted by the State before the District Court, described the\n\ndisclosure process in place at the present time for corporate spending on ballot issue\n\nmeasures. Unsworth stated that independent expenditures from a corporate treasury to\n\nsupport or oppose a ballot measure must be reported on the Commissioner of Political\n\nPractices’ Form C-4. The C-4 form is for “incidental political committees,” which are\n\ndefined in the Commissioner’s rules as “a political committee that is not specifically\n\norganized or maintained for the primary purpose of influencing elections but that may\n\n                                          33\n\fincidentally become a political committee by making a contribution or expenditure to\n\nsupport or oppose a candidate and/or issue.” Admin. R. M. 44.10.327(2)(c). The only\n\nother types of political committees are “principal campaign committees” and\n\n“independent committees,” both of which are committees specifically organized to\n\nsupport or oppose various candidates or issues. An independent committee includes a\n\nPolitical Action Committee.         Admin. R. M. 44.10.327(2)(b)(i).           Thus, the\n\nCommissioner’s rules treat corporate treasury expenditures as expenditures by “incidental\n\ncommittees” because the entities do not exist for the specific purpose of supporting or\n\nopposing candidates, ballot issues, or both.\n\n¶58    The integrity and purpose of the law can be salvaged by permitting the\n\nCommissioner to apply “incidental committee” status to a separate fund in a\n\ncorporation’s treasury from which election-related expenditures are made. This would\n\nensure that corporate contributions are on the same footing, and are given the same public\n\ndaylight, as contributions from individuals, political action committees, and political\n\nparties. See generally, § 13-37-225, MCA; Admin. R. M. 44.10.321 – 44.10.333.\n\n¶59    The value of disclosure in preventing corruption cannot be understated. “[B]y\n\nrevealing information about the contributors to and participants in public discourse and\n\ndebate, disclosure laws help ensure that voters have the facts they need to evaluate the\n\nvarious messages competing for their attention.”         Human Life of Wash., Inc. v.\n\nBrumsickle, 624 F.3d 990, 1005 (9th Cir. 2010). “[P]rompt disclosure of expenditures\n\ncan provide shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations\n\nand elected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.” Citizens United, 130\n\n                                         34\n\fS. Ct. at 916. The Ninth Circuit has recognized the importance of Montana’s interest in\n\ndisclosure in the context of ballot issue campaigns. Canyon Ferry Rd. Baptist Church of\n\nEast Helena v. Unsworth, 556 F.3d 1021, 1032 (2009) (citing cases and noting disclosure\n\nrequirements “may prevent ‘the wolf from masquerading in sheep’s clothing.’”).\n\nRegardless of the ultimate fate of Montana’s ban on corporate political expenditures,\n\nstate disclosure requirements should be applied to all expenditures by corporate entities\n\n“in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a\n\ncandidate or a political party.” Section 13-35-227(1), MCA.\n\n¶60   In conclusion, I believe it is our unflagging obligation, in keeping with the courts’\n\nduty to safeguard the rule of law, to honor the decisions of our nation’s highest Court.\n\n“Americans today accept the [United States Supreme] Court’s role as guardian of the law.\n\nThey understand the value to the nation of following Court decisions, . . . even when they\n\ndisagree with a Court decision and even when they may be right and the decisions may be\n\nwrong.” Stephen Breyer, Making Our Democracy Work: A Judge’s View 214 (Alfred A.\n\nKnopf 2010).    Citizens United makes clear that a state’s outright ban on corporate\n\npolitical expenditures violates the First Amendment.       Since § 13-35-227(1), MCA,\n\nimposes just such a ban, I respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision to uphold the\n\nstatute in its entirety. I would instead uphold only those provisions necessary to ensure\n\nindependent corporate expenditures properly are reported and full disclosure is made to\n\ninform citizens and shareholders of the corporation’s election-related spending.\n\n\n\n                                                /S/ BETH BAKER\n\n                                        35\n\fJustice James C. Nelson, dissenting.\n\n¶61    I respectfully dissent from the Court’s decision.\n\n                                  I. INTRODUCTION\n\n¶62    The Supreme Court1 could not have been more clear in Citizens United v. Federal\n\nElection Commission, ___ U.S.___, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010): corporations have broad\n\nrights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to engage in political\n\nspeech, and corporations cannot be prohibited from using general treasury funds for this\n\npurpose based on antidistortion, anticorruption, or shareholder-protection interests. The\n\nlanguage of the Citizens United majority opinion is remarkably sweeping and leaves\n\nvirtually no conceivable basis for muzzling or otherwise restricting corporate political\n\nspeech in the form of independent expenditures.2\n\n¶63    As a result, the critical question presented in the case now before us is simply this:\n\nHas the State of Montana identified a compelling state interest, not already rejected by\n\nthe Supreme Court, that would justify the outright ban on corporate expenditures for\n\npolitical speech effected by § 13-35-227(1), MCA? Having considered the matter, I\n\nbelieve the Montana Attorney General has identified some very compelling reasons for\n\nlimiting corporate expenditures in Montana’s political process. The problem, however, is\n\nthat regardless of how persuasive I may think the Attorney General’s justifications are,\n\nthe Supreme Court has already rebuffed each and every one of them. Accordingly, as\n\nmuch as I would like to rule in favor of the State, I cannot in good faith do so.\n\n       1\n         I refer to the United States Supreme Court as “the Supreme Court.” References\nto the Montana Supreme Court include “the Court,” “this Court,” “we,” and “our.”\n       2\n         As the Court notes, direct contributions are not at issue here. Opinion, ¶ 8.\n\f¶64    The Court, on the other hand, views the matter differently. The Court concludes\n\nthat Montana may bar corporations from using general treasury funds for political\n\nspeech—Citizens     United    notwithstanding—because       “Montana     has     unique   and\n\ncompelling interests to protect.” Opinion, ¶ 37. What “unique” interests render Montana\n\nexempt from Citizens United? One searches the Court’s Opinion in vain to find any. The\n\nCourt states that Montana has “a clear interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral\n\nprocess” and “an interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana electorate.”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 38. Yet, Montana is hardly unique in this regard. Every state in the Union is\n\ninterested in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging the full\n\nparticipation of its electorate. The Court asserts that Montana has interests in “protecting\n\nand preserving its system of elected judges,” “preserving the appearance of judicial\n\npropriety and independence so as to maintain the public’s trust and confidence,” and\n\n“protecting the due process rights of litigants.” Opinion, ¶¶ 39, 40, 45. But surely every\n\nstate with an elected judiciary has these same interests.       The Court also cites “the\n\ncompelling interest of the people of Montana in strong voter participation in the process.”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 41. Again, however, the people of Montana are certainly not the only people\n\nin the United States with a compelling interest in strong voter participation.\n\n¶65    The fact is that none of the interests identified by the Court are unique to Montana.\n\nWhat the Court is really saying is that Montana has a unique history and unique qualities\n\nwhich make Montana uniquely susceptible to the corrupting influence of unlimited\n\ncorporate expenditures. Indeed, the Court points to Montana’s history involving the\n\nCopper Kings—their bribery of public officials, their manipulation of state government,\n\n                                         37\n\fand their control over local judges in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Opinion, ¶¶ 22-28.\n\nBased on this history, the Court concludes that Montana voters “had a compelling interest\n\nto enact the challenged statute in 1912.”        Opinion, ¶ 36.    Furthermore, the Court\n\nconcludes that the dangers of corporate influence and domination still exist in Montana.\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 29-31. In fact, the Court asserts that Montana is “especially vulnerable to\n\ncontinued efforts of corporate control to the detriment of democracy and the republican\n\nform of government.” Opinion, ¶ 37. According to the Court, this is owing to Montana’s\n\nsparse population, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development,\n\nlocation as a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs. Opinion, ¶ 37. Given\n\nthese characteristics, the Court opines that unlimited corporate money would “irrevocably\n\nchange the dynamic of local Montana political office races, which have historically been\n\ncharacterized by the low-dollar, broad-based campaigns run by Montana candidates.”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 38. Moreover, the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or\n\nopposition to a targeted candidate would “minimize[ ] the impact of individual citizens”\n\nin the political process and leave the average citizen “effectively shut out of the process.”\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 38, 41. Accordingly, the Court holds that Montana may flat-out prohibit\n\ndirect political spending by corporations.\n\n¶66    Respectfully, I cannot agree that this “Montana is unique” rationale is consistent\n\nwith Citizens United. And I seriously doubt this rationale is going to prevail in the\n\nSupreme Court when this case is appealed, as it almost certainly will be. For one thing, a\n\nfair reading of the Citizens United majority opinion, coupled with a fair reading of the\n\nseparate concurring and dissenting opinions, leads inescapably to the conclusion that\n\n                                         38\n\fevery one of the Attorney General’s arguments—and this Court’s rationales adopting\n\nthose arguments—was argued, considered, and then flatly rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nMoreover, even accepting the propositions that Montana experienced an egregious period\n\nof corporate domination and political corruption at the turn of the 20th century, that\n\nMontana citizens understandably became fed up with the heavy-handed influence and\n\ncorrupt practices of special interests at the time, and that Montana to this day remains\n\nespecially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate control, what the Court and the\n\nAttorney General have failed to recognize is this fundamental point: a ban on corporate\n\nspeech is not a constitutionally permissible remedy for these problems. This should be\n\nabundantly clear from the following passage in Citizens United:\n\n      If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent\n      expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put\n      expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We\n      must give weight to attempts by [the legislative branch] to seek to dispel\n      either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies\n      enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is\n      our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule.\n      An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical\n      preelection period is not a permissible remedy.\n\n130 S. Ct. at 911 (emphases added).\n\n¶67   The federal law struck down in Citizens United (2 U.S.C. § 441b, as amended by\n\n§ 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002) prohibited corporations from\n\nexpressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates and from broadcasting\n\nelectioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a\n\ngeneral election. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887, 897. The Montana law at issue here\n\nis even more categorical, prohibiting corporations from ever using general treasury funds\n\n                                       39\n\ffor political advocacy. Section 13-35-227(1), MCA (“A corporation may not make a\n\ncontribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee\n\nthat supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.”). If the federal law is facially\n\nunconstitutional, as the Supreme Court held, then I cannot envision any possibility that\n\nthe Montana law will survive the predictable appeal of this Court’s decision.\n\n¶68    Unquestionably, Montana has its own unique history. No doubt Montana also has\n\ncompelling interests in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging\n\nthe full participation of its electorate. And Montana may indeed be more vulnerable than\n\nother states to corporate domination of the political process. But the notion argued by the\n\nAttorney General and adopted by the Court—that these characteristics entitle Montana to\n\na special “no peeing” zone in the First Amendment swimming pool—is simply untenable\n\nunder Citizens United.\n\n¶69    Admittedly, I have never had to write a more frustrating dissent. I agree, at least\n\nin principle, with much of the Court’s discussion and with the arguments of the Attorney\n\nGeneral. More to the point, I thoroughly disagree with the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nCitizens United. I agree, rather, with the eloquent and, in my view, better-reasoned\n\ndissent of Justice Stevens. As a result, I find myself in the distasteful position of having\n\nto defend the applicability of a controlling precedent with which I profoundly disagree. 3\n\n¶70    That said, this case is ultimately not about my agreement or disagreement with the\n\nAttorney General or our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the Citizens United decision.\n\n       3\n        The task is all the more distasteful in light of Western Tradition Partnership’s\nquestionable tactics and blatant hypocrisy. See Opinion, ¶¶ 7, 9, 19; Br. of Appellants\n10-11, 22-23 (Apr. 15, 2011).\n                                         40\n\fWhether we agree with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the First Amendment is\n\nirrelevant. In accordance with our federal system of government, our obligations here are\n\nto acknowledge that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the United States Constitution\n\nis, for better or for worse, binding on this Court and on the officers of this state, and to\n\napply the law faithful to the Supreme Court’s ruling.\n\n¶71    Granted, there are some in the legislative and executive branches of government\n\nwho would call—and, in fact, have called—for Montana to thumb its nose at the federal\n\ngovernment, to disregard federal law, and to boldly ignore the Supremacy Clause (U.S.\n\nConst., art. VI, cl. 2). See e.g. Mike Dennison, Bills Test State’s Power to Nullify Fed\n\nLaws, Helena Independent Record (Feb. 13, 2011). Regardless of those views, however,\n\nall elected officials in Montana—legislative, executive, and judicial—are sworn to\n\n“support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.” Mont. Const. art. III,\n\n§ 3. Obviously, this means in accordance with the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the\n\nUnited States Constitution. Thus, when the highest court in the country has spoken\n\nclearly on a matter of federal constitutional law, as it did in Citizens United, the highest\n\ncourt in Montana—this Court—is not at liberty to disregard or parse that decision in\n\norder to uphold a state law that, while politically popular, is clearly at odds with the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision. This is the rule of law and is part and parcel of every judge’s\n\nand justice’s oath of office to “support, protect and defend the constitution of the United\n\nStates.” In my view, this Court’s decision today fails to do so.\n\n¶72    The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected the notion that corporate political\n\nspeech may be restricted based on interests in protecting against political and campaign\n\n                                         41\n\fcorruption, safeguarding the ability of individual citizens to compete and participate in\n\nthe political process, and preserving judicial integrity and impartiality. It makes no sense\n\nwhatsoever that a state may rely on these very same interests—despite their rejection by\n\nthe Supreme Court—as grounds for muzzling corporate speech simply because the state’s\n\nhistory, demographics, economics, and elections are in some way “unique.” It also\n\nmakes no sense that, on one hand, the First Amendment protects corporate expenditures\n\nfor political speech at the federal level and, apparently, throughout the rest of the country4\n\nbut that, on the other hand, this First Amendment protection magically evaporates at\n\nMontana’s borders because of a law adopted 100 years ago to address a very fact-specific\n\nsituation. See Larry Howell, Once Upon a Time in the West: Citizens United, Caperton,\n\nand the War of the Copper Kings, at 6-16 (under the heading “The Montana Situation”)\n\n(available at http://mtlr.org). Indeed, if the Supreme Court countenances this Court’s\n\napproach of restricting corporate political speech rights based on population density, the\n\nexistence of “mineral wealth,” a history of “low-dollar, broad-based campaigns,” and past\n\nexperience with “heavy-handed influence” asserted by corporations, then there shortly\n\nwill be nothing left of Citizens United at the state level. Due to its unpopularity, the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision will be “state-lawed” into oblivion. While this would be a\n\n\n       4\n        See Robert Barnes, Citizens United Decision Reverberates in Courts across\nCountry, Washington Post (May 22, 2011) (“The [Supreme Court’s] January 2010\ndecision freeing corporations and unions to spend whatever they like for and against\ncandidates wiped out laws in 24 states banning such spending. Only Montana still wages\na lonely court battle to maintain the ban.”); Natl. Conf. of State Legislatures, Citizens\nUnited and the States, http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=19607 (updated Jan. 4,\n2011) (noting that “[i]n 17 of the 24 states with laws affected by the Citizens United\ndecision, legislation has been introduced to amend the law,” and listing the bills).\n                                          42\n\fgood thing in the view of many, my point here is that the Supreme Court clearly did not\n\nintend, with the broad, sweeping, and unqualified language it used, to allow the holding\n\nof Citizens United to be circumvented through “uniqueness” stratagems.\n\n¶73    Therefore, and with all due respect to my colleagues, I believe this Court is simply\n\nwrong in its refusal to affirm the District Court. Like it or not, Citizens United is the law\n\nof the land as regards corporate political speech. There is no “Montana exception.” The\n\nproof of the Court’s error is found in a comparison of the rationales provided in the\n\nCourt’s Opinion with the statements by the Supreme Court rejecting those rationales. I\n\nbegin with an analysis of the Citizens United decision.\n\n                                 II. CITIZENS UNITED\n\n¶74    A significant portion of the Citizens United decision is devoted to the threshold\n\nquestion whether the Supreme Court should even be deciding the constitutional matters\n\nthat it ultimately does decide. Indeed, the five Justices in the majority—Justice Kennedy\n\njoined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito—\n\nconsumed numerous pages attempting to explain why they were (1) addressing a claim\n\nthat Citizens United had expressly dismissed in the district court (its facial challenge to\n\nthe law’s constitutionality), (2) deciding the case on grounds that arguably were broader\n\nthan necessary to resolve Citizens United’s claim, and (3) overruling prior precedents\n\nnotwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 888-96,\n\n911-13 (majority opinion); 130 S. Ct. at 917-25 (Roberts, C.J., & Alito, J., concurring).\n\nWith regard to these issues, the dissent—Justice Stevens joined by Justice Ginsburg,\n\nJustice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor—accused the majority of simply being “unhappy\n\n                                         43\n\fwith the limited nature of the case before us,” of having “disdain” for the prior\n\nprecedents, and thus of “chang[ing] the case to give themselves an opportunity to change\n\nthe law.”5 Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 932, 938. The dissent also criticized the\n\nmajority’s determination to invalidate the statute on facial grounds, not only because this\n\napproach is “ ‘contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint’ ” and has the\n\nsecondary effect of “implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well,” but also\n\nbecause the record before the Supreme Court was “nonexistent.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 932-33. Whereas Congress had crafted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of\n\n2002 (BCRA) “in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that\n\nprevious legislation had failed to avert,” the majority “now negates Congress’ efforts\n\nwithout a shred of evidence on how § 203 or its state-law counterparts have been\n\naffecting any entity other than Citizens United.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 933. The\n\ndissent argued that “it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress’ years of\n\nbipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming\n\nthat the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral\n\ncompetition.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 969. Finally, the dissent argued that the case\n\ncould have been decided on various narrower grounds, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n936-38, and that the majority had failed to give proper deference to the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis, 130 S. Ct. at 938-42. On this latter point, the dissent observed that\n\n       5\n         Unfortunately, remaking cases is not a phenomenon exclusive to the Supreme\nCourt. See e.g. Western Sec. Bank and Glacier Bancorp, Inc. v. Eide Bailly LLP, 2010\nMT 291, ¶¶ 71-82, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35 (Nelson, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part); PacifiCorp v. State, 2011 MT 93, ¶¶ 65-67, 360 Mont. 259, 253 P.3d\n847 (Rice & Nelson, JJ., concurring).\n                                          44\n\f       [s]tare decisis protects not only personal rights involving property or\n       contract but also the ability of the elected branches to shape their laws in an\n       effective and coherent fashion. Today’s decision takes away a power that\n       we have long permitted these branches to exercise. State legislatures have\n       relied on their authority to regulate corporate electioneering, confirmed in\n       [Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 110 S. Ct. 1391\n       (1990)], for more than a century. The Federal Congress has relied on this\n       authority for a comparable stretch of time, and it specifically relied on\n       Austin throughout the years it spent developing and debating BCRA. The\n       total record it compiled was 100,000 pages long. Pulling out the rug\n       beneath Congress after affirming the constitutionality of § 203 six years\n       ago shows great disrespect for a coequal branch.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 940 (emphasis in original, footnotes omitted).6\n\n¶75    While I believe the Citizens United dissent makes a persuasive argument that the\n\nmajority need not and should not have rendered such a broad constitutional holding, the\n\nfact remains that the majority did so, striking down the federal law as facially invalid.\n\nThus, my focus hereafter is on what the majority specifically held regarding corporate\n\nindependent expenditures on political speech. I approach this in step-by-step fashion.\n\n       A. The First Amendment Applies to Political Speech by Corporations\n\n¶76    The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging\n\nthe freedom of speech.” This protection extends to corporations and to the context of\n\npolitical speech. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899, 900. Political speech does not lose\n\n       6\n         In addition to the foregoing criticisms by the dissent, I note that the Citizens\nUnited majority’s approach has also been criticized for flouting the very rhetoric that\nconservatives have espoused for decades against so-called “judicial activism.” See e.g.\nErwin Chemerinsky, Op., Conservatives Embrace Judicial Activism in Campaign\nFinance Ruling, L.A. Times (Jan. 22, 2010); see also Reza Dibadj, Citizens United as\nCorporate Law Narrative, 16 Nexus 39, 40-48 (2010-2011) (noting “technical concerns”\nand “constitutional problems” with the majority’s approach); J. Harvie Wilkinson III, Of\nGuns, Abortions, and the Unraveling Rule of Law, 95 Va. L. Rev. 253 (2009) (criticizing\nthe same five-Justice majority for not adhering to a conservative judicial methodology in\nDist. of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008)).\n                                         45\n\fFirst Amendment protection simply because its source is a corporation. Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 900. The identity of the speaker is not decisive in determining whether\n\nspeech is protected; corporations and other associations, like individuals, contribute to the\n\ndiscussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and ideas that the First\n\nAmendment seeks to foster. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 900. The Supreme Court “has\n\nthus rejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations\n\nshould be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such\n\nassociations are not ‘natural persons.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 900.\n\n                 B. Section 441b Burdens Corporate Political Speech\n\n¶77    The law at issue (2 U.S.C. § 441b, as amended by § 203 of the BCRA) prohibits\n\ncorporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make independent\n\nexpenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates. It also prohibits\n\nthe broadcast of electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and\n\n60 days of a general election. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887, 897. This prohibition\n\non corporate independent expenditures is a ban on speech. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n898. It is true that corporations and unions may establish a “separate segregated fund”\n\n(known as a political action committee or PAC) for purposes of express advocacy or\n\nelectioneering communications.      The moneys received by the PAC are limited to\n\ndonations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions,\n\nmembers of the union. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887-88. Nevertheless, § 441b “is a\n\nban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can\n\nstill speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897. This is because “[a] PAC is a separate\n\n                                         46\n\fassociation from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from § 441b’s expenditure ban\n\ndoes not allow corporations to speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (citation\n\nomitted). Furthermore, “[e]ven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak—\n\nand it does not—the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment\n\nproblems with § 441b.       PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to\n\nadminister and subject to extensive regulations.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897.\n\n                        C. Standard of Review: Strict Scrutiny\n\n¶78    “While it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or\n\nrestricted as a categorical matter,” the following standard “provides a sufficient\n\nframework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case.” Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 898. Laws that burden political speech are subject to strict scrutiny,\n\nwhich requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest\n\nand is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\n                        D. The Governmental-Function Interest\n\n¶79    The First Amendment prohibits restrictions that distinguish among different\n\nspeakers, allowing speech by some but not others. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\nHence, the government “may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies\n\ncertain preferred speakers.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899. The Supreme Court has\n\nupheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain\n\npersons, but these rulings were based on “the proposition that there are certain\n\ngovernmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds\n\nof speech”—e.g., the function of public school education, the penological objectives of\n\n                                         47\n\fthe corrections system, and the capacity of the government to discharge its military\n\nresponsibilities. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899. This interest is not applicable here\n\nbecause the corporate independent expenditures at issue would not interfere with\n\ngovernmental functions. Quite the contrary, “it is inherent in the nature of the political\n\nprocess that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to\n\ndetermine how to cast their votes.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899.\n\n                             E. The Antidistortion Interest\n\n¶80    The Supreme Court in Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 110\n\nS. Ct. 1391 (1990), found a compelling governmental interest in preventing “ ‘the\n\ncorrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated\n\nwith the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s\n\nsupport for the corporation’s political ideas.’ ”     Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903\n\n(quoting Austin, 494 U.S. at 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1397). The concerns in this regard are that\n\ncorporations can “use resources amassed in the economic marketplace to obtain an unfair\n\nadvantage in the political marketplace,” and that corporate wealth can “dominat[e] . . . the\n\npolitical process” and “unfairly influence elections” when it is deployed in the form of\n\nindependent expenditures.     Austin, 494 U.S. at 659, 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1397, 1398\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶81    The problem with this “antidistortion rationale,” however, is that it is inconsistent\n\nwith the First Amendment. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904-08. For one thing, “ ‘the\n\nconcept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order\n\nto enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.’ ”\n\n                                         48\n\fCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904 (alteration omitted) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424\n\nU.S. 1, 48-49, 96 S. Ct. 612, 649 (1976) (per curiam)).\n\n       Buckley rejected the premise that the Government has an interest “in\n       equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the\n       outcome of elections.” Buckley was specific in stating that “the\n       skyrocketing cost of political campaigns” could not sustain the\n       governmental prohibition. The First Amendment’s protections do not\n       depend on the speaker’s “financial ability to engage in public discussion.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904 (citations omitted).\n\n¶82    Additionally, the antidistortion rationale interferes with the “open marketplace” of\n\nideas protected by the First Amendment by permitting the government to ban the political\n\nspeech of millions of associations of citizens. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 906-07.\n\nMost of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth—a fact which\n\nbelies the argument that the statute at issue is justified on the ground that it prevents the\n\n“distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n907. In any event, political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy,\n\nand this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an\n\nindividual. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904. “Corporations, like individuals, do not\n\nhave monolithic views. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise,\n\nleaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts,\n\nincluding the speech of candidates and elected officials.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n912. By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit,\n\nthe government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and\n\nadvising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests. Citizens United,\n\n\n                                         49\n\f130 S. Ct. at 907. In so doing, the government muffles the voices that best represent the\n\nmost significant segments of the economy and deprives the electorate of information,\n\nknowledge, and opinion vital to its function. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 907. When\n\nthe government seeks to use its power “to command where a person may get his or her\n\ninformation or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control\n\nthought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for\n\nourselves.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n                            F. The Anticorruption Interest\n\n¶83   The Government argues that corporate political speech may be banned in order to\n\nprevent corruption or its appearance. The Buckley Court found this interest sufficiently\n\nimportant to allow limits on contributions. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (citing\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 25, 96 S. Ct. at 638). But when the Buckley Court examined a ban\n\non independent expenditures, it found “that the governmental interest in preventing\n\ncorruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify [the ban].” Buckley,\n\n424 U.S. at 45, 96 S. Ct. at 647. For the reasons which follow, that holding is reaffirmed\n\nhere. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908-11.\n\n¶84   “ ‘The hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for political\n\nfavors.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (quoting Fed. Election Commn. v. Natl.\n\nConservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.S. 480, 497, 105 S. Ct. 1459, 1468 (1985)).\n\n“[C]ontribution limits, . . . unlike limits on independent expenditures, have been an\n\naccepted means to prevent quid pro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909.\n\nNot only can large direct contributions be given to secure a political quid pro quo, the\n\n                                        50\n\fscope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 908 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S. Ct. at 638). Thus, limits on direct\n\ncontributions are permissible to ensure against the reality or appearance of quid pro quo\n\ncorruption. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n¶85    Independent expenditures, in contrast, have a substantially diminished potential\n\nfor abuse. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908. By definition, an independent expenditure\n\nis political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910. “ ‘The absence of prearrangement and coordination of\n\nan expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the\n\nexpenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given\n\nas a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.’ ” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 908 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 47, 96 S. Ct. at 648). Limits on independent\n\nexpenditures, therefore, “have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government’s\n\ninterest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n¶86    “When Buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in\n\npreventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid\n\npro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909. Two years later, the Supreme\n\nCourt purported to leave open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures\n\ncould be shown to cause corruption. See First Natl. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S.\n\n765, 788 n. 26, 98 S. Ct. 1407, 1422 n. 26 (1978). However, “we now conclude that\n\nindependent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to\n\ncorruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909.\n\n                                         51\n\f¶87    The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does\n\nnot mean that these officials are corrupt. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910.\n\n       “Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics.\n       It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and,\n       by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support\n       those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason,\n       if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one\n       candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing\n       those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on\n       responsiveness.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (ellipsis in original) (quoting McConnell v. Fed.\n\nElection Commn., 540 U.S. 93, 297, 124 S. Ct. 619, 748 (2003) (Kennedy, J., Rehnquist,\n\nC.J., & Scalia, J., dissenting)). The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will\n\nnot cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.         As noted, an independent\n\nexpenditure is, by definition, political speech presented to the electorate that is not\n\ncoordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing\n\nto spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate\n\ninfluence over elected officials.     This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the\n\nelectorate will refuse to take part in democratic governance because of additional political\n\nspeech made by a corporation or any other speaker. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910.\n\n¶88    In sum, the hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for\n\npolitical favors. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910. The government has a sufficiently\n\nimportant interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of it. Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 909. Indeed, a quid pro quo arrangement would be covered by\n\nbribery laws. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908. Independent expenditures, however,\n\n\n                                          52\n\f“do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption. In fact, there is\n\nonly scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate.         Ingratiation and\n\naccess, in any event, are not corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (citation\n\nomitted). Therefore, “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations,\n\ndo not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 909.   Of course, if elected officials succumb to improper influences from\n\nindependent expenditures, surrender their best judgment, and put expediency before\n\nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern; but in attempting to dispel either the\n\nappearance or the reality of these influences, “[a]n outright ban on corporate political\n\nspeech . . . is not a permissible remedy.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n                        G. The Shareholder-Protection Interest\n\n¶89    The Government argues that corporate independent expenditures can be limited in\n\nthe interest of protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate\n\npolitical speech with which they do not agree. The First Amendment, however, does not\n\nallow the government to restrict corporate speech based on a shareholder’s disagreement\n\nwith the political views of the corporation. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911. There is,\n\nfurthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders through the\n\nprocedures of corporate democracy. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n                                  H. Foreign Influence\n\n¶90    “We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling\n\ninterest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation’s\n\npolitical process.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n                                         53\n\f                                       I. Conclusion\n\n¶91    Based on the foregoing, the Supreme Court overruled its decision in Austin. “We\n\nreturn to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not\n\nsuppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient\n\ngovernmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit\n\ncorporations.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the\n\nSupreme Court held that BCRA § 203’s restriction on electioneering communications\n\nand 2 U.S.C. § 441b’s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for express\n\nadvocacy were both invalid. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913. The Supreme Court\n\n(with only Justice Thomas dissenting) then went on to uphold BCRA’s disclaimer and\n\ndisclosure provisions against an as-applied constitutional challenge. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 913-16.\n\n                            III. THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS\n\n¶92    Before examining this Court’s rationales upholding § 13-35-227(1), MCA,7 it is\n\nnecessary to dispel some misconceptions regarding the plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n¶93    First, the Court asserts that neither Gary Marbut, the founder of Montana Shooting\n\nSports Association (MSSA), nor Kenneth Champion, the sole shareholder of Champion\n\nPainting, Inc., has demonstrated “any material way” in which Montana law has hindered\n\nor censored their political activity or speech. Opinion, ¶ 17. Of course, Marbut and\n\nChampion are not parties to this lawsuit, and their speech rights are not at issue here.\n\nHence, whether Marbut and Champion, as individuals, have been hindered or censored in\n\n       7\n           I occasionally refer to § 13-35-227, MCA, hereafter as “Section 227” or “§ 227.”\n                                          54\n\ftheir political activity or speech is totally irrelevant. The question is whether the speech\n\nrights of MSSA and Champion Painting, as incorporated entities, have been infringed.\n\n¶94    Second, the Court asserts that MSSA has failed to demonstrate that its speech has\n\nbeen impaired by § 227 because Montana law places no restriction on MSSA to spend its\n\nmembers’ dues on political advocacy. Opinion, ¶ 17. As support for this, the Court cites\n\nthe affidavit of former Commissioner of Political Practices Dennis Unsworth. What\n\nUnsworth specifically says, however, is this: “[MSSA] has been and continues to be free\n\nto spend its member dues and donations from its treasury regardless of its corporate\n\nstatus, as long as it complies with the filing requirements described above and meets the\n\ncriteria for a voluntary association.” (Emphasis added.) The affidavit of Mary Baker,\n\nprogram supervisor in the Office of the Commissioner of Political Practices, likewise\n\nstates that “there is nothing in Montana’s campaign finance laws that would prohibit\n\n[MSSA] from registering itself as a committee and making independent expenditures\n\nfrom its corporate treasury, if it meets our office’s criteria for a voluntary association.”8\n\n(Emphasis added.) According to Unsworth’s affidavit, those criteria are as follows:\n\n             A voluntary association that incorporates can spend its members’\n       dues and donations on campaign contributions and independent\n       expenditures from its treasury, if it: (1) is formed for the express purpose\n\n       8\n         An exemption for “voluntary associations” is not codified in the statute. Rather,\nit is the Commissioner’s “policy” to except such associations from § 227(1). Prior to\n2003, a narrow category of nonprofit corporations was statutorily permitted to make\ncontributions to or expenditures in connection with ballot issues, notwithstanding the\ngeneral prohibition on corporate contributions and expenditures. See § 13-35-227(1), (4),\nMCA (2001). But in light of Mont. Chamber of Commerce v. Argenbright, 226 F.3d\n1049 (9th Cir. 2000), which held that corporations cannot be prohibited from making\ndirect corporate expenditures in ballot initiative campaigns, the 2003 Legislature\namended the statute accordingly. See Laws of Montana, 2003, ch. 59.\n                                         55\n\f      of promoting political ideas, and could not engage in business activities;\n      (2) has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on\n      its assets or earnings; (3) is not established by a business corporation, and\n      does not accept contributions from business corporations.\n\n¶95   Contrary to the Court’s implication, there has been no determination in this case\n\nthat MSSA in fact meets the criteria of a “voluntary association.” And one of the exhibits\n\nattached to Unsworth’s affidavit indicates that MSSA does not satisfy the criteria. The\n\nexhibit is an “advisory opinion” issued by former Commissioner Linda Vaughey on\n\nSeptember 25, 2003, in which she addresses whether the nonprofit corporation People for\n\nResponsible Government (PRG) may engage in political activities in connection with\n\ncandidates for public office. Vaughey starts with the premise that § 227 “appears on its\n\nface to prohibit all corporations, including nonprofit corporations, from making\n\ncontributions or expenditures in connection with candidates, other than through separate,\n\nsegregated funds.” Vaughey then observes that, based on Fed. Election Commn. v. Mass.\n\nCitizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238, 263-64, 107 S. Ct. 616, 631 (1986), there is an\n\nexception for nonprofit corporations which meet the three criteria listed above. Vaughey\n\nfinally determines that PRG does not meet the third criterion because\n\n      [n]othing in the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, or the other\n      information you have provided confirms that PRG was not established by a\n      business corporation or a labor organization. Moreover, you have not\n      provided any information establishing that PRG does not directly or\n      indirectly accept donations or contributions of anything of value from\n      business corporations or labor organizations. [Emphasis added.]\n\nLikewise here, there is no evidence in the record—not in Marbut’s affidavit, in MSSA’s\n\nArticles of Incorporation (attached to Marbut’s affidavit), in Unsworth’s affidavit, in\n\nBaker’s affidavit, or in any other document—establishing that MSSA “does not directly\n\n                                        56\n\for indirectly accept donations or contributions of anything of value from business\n\ncorporations or labor organizations.” Hence, MSSA does not qualify as a “voluntary\n\nassociation” under the Commissioner’s definition, and MSSA is not allowed to use its\n\ngeneral treasury funds to make independent expenditures in connection with candidate\n\nelections.   MSSA states in the First Amended Complaint that it wishes to “use its\n\ncorporate funds to directly support or oppose candidates.” In light of the foregoing\n\ndiscussion, § 227(1) bars MSSA from doing so. The Court is flat wrong, therefore, in\n\nstating that “the statute has no or minimal impact” on MSSA. Opinion, ¶ 46.\n\n¶96    Third, the Court likewise misstates the impact on Champion Painting. For one\n\nthing, the Court again seems to be improperly focused on Champion’s speech rights,\n\nwhich are not at issue, rather than Champion Painting’s speech rights, which are at issue.\n\nOpinion, ¶ 18. The Court also suggests that the only reason Champion Painting is\n\nparticipating in this lawsuit is so that its shareholder (Champion) can be allowed to make\n\n“candidate endorsement[s]” using the company name. Opinion, ¶ 18. Finally, the Court\n\nasserts that because Champion, as sole shareholder, can simply establish a PAC to\n\nadvocate for Champion Painting’s interests and expend funds that he will decide to\n\ncontribute, Opinion, ¶ 18, “the statute has no or minimal impact on . . . Champion,”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 46. The Court is wrong on all counts.\n\n¶97    According to the First Amended Complaint,\n\n       Champion Painting intends to spend corporate funds to educate the citizens\n       of Montana and Bozeman about political candidates and ballot issues that\n       will either positively or negatively impact Montana’s small businesses, and\n       Champion Painting intends to publicly support or oppose candidates and\n       issues relating to Montana’s small businesses. The corporate funds will be\n\n                                        57\n\f       spent to purchase TV spots and radio advertisements, and to create and\n       distribute brochures and fliers . . . .\n\nChampion’s affidavit is to the same effect: “In addition to being politically active as an\n\nindividual, I would like for Champion Painting to be politically active. . . .        Since\n\nChampion Painting is a small business, its voice will be more effective than my voice\n\nwhen supporting or opposing candidates who may have an impact on small businesses.”\n\nIt is apparent, then, that Champion Painting’s claim is about the corporation’s ability to\n\nspeak, not its shareholder’s ability to speak. And as the Court concedes, § 227(1) forbids\n\nthe expenditure of Champion Painting’s corporate funds to support or oppose candidates.\n\nOpinion, ¶ 18. Nothing in § 227 exempts corporations held by a sole shareholder. As for\n\nthe Court’s theory that Champion Painting could speak through a PAC, Opinion, ¶ 18, the\n\nSupreme Court rejected this approach as discussed above and noted again below.\n\n                                  IV. COMPARISON\n\n¶98    I now turn to a comparison of the rationales provided in the Court’s Opinion with\n\nthe statements by the Supreme Court rejecting those rationales. Again, the specific issue\n\nis the constitutionality of § 227(1)’s prohibition on corporate expenditures in connection\n\nwith a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a\n\npolitical party. The disclosure laws, the prohibition on direct corporate contributions, and\n\nthe Corrupt Practices Act as a whole have not been challenged. Opinion, ¶¶ 2, 8.\n\n                        A. The Political Committee Alternative\n\n¶99    Section 227(1) states that “[a] corporation may not make a contribution or an\n\nexpenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or\n\n\n                                         58\n\fopposes a candidate or a political party.” Section 227(3), however, provides that “[t]his\n\nsection does not prohibit the establishment or administration of a separate, segregated\n\nfund [known as a political committee or PAC] to be used for making political\n\ncontributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited\n\nfrom an individual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation.” See\n\nOpinion, ¶ 4.\n\n¶100 The Court asserts that, in Montana, political committees are “easy to establish,”\n\n“easy to use,” and an “effective alternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in\n\npolitical speech.” Opinion, ¶¶ 21, 47. The Supreme Court, however, stated: “A PAC is\n\na separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from [the law’s]\n\nexpenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897\n\n(citation omitted). Moreover, “[e]ven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to\n\nspeak—and it does not—the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First\n\nAmendment problems.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (emphasis added).\n\n¶101 The Court ignores the Supreme Court’s holding that a PAC is “separate” from the\n\ncorporation and, thus, is not a valid alternative to direct corporate expenditures. Indeed,\n\nthe Court asserts that the Supreme Court rejected PACs “because of the burdensome,\n\nextensive, and expensive Federal regulations that applied.” Opinion, ¶ 12. This is false.\n\nGranted, the Supreme Court briefly noted that “PACs are burdensome alternatives; they\n\nare expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 897. Yet, even if federal PACs were as “easily implemented” as the Court says\n\nMontana’s PACs are, Opinion, ¶ 21, the fundamental problem with PACs still remains:\n\n                                         59\n\f“A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from [the\n\nlaw’s] expenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 897 (citation omitted). Bottom line: “[Section 227(1)] is a ban on corporate speech\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation [as permitted under\n\n§ 227(3)] can still speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897. The Court’s contrary\n\nholding is plainly wrong.\n\n               B. Anticorruption and Restraining Corporate Influence\n\n¶102 The Court cites various examples of “well-financed corruption” perpetrated by\n\nF. Augustus Heinze, the Anaconda Company, and W.A. Clark.                 Opinion, ¶¶ 23-28.\n\nNotably, some of these examples involved blatant bribery and quid pro quo corruption\n\n(i.e., dollars for political favors), but it is not clear that any of them involved independent\n\nexpenditures (i.e., political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with\n\na candidate) in exchange for political favors. In any event, the Court then proceeds to\n\npaint a dismal picture of the corporate “domination” and “influence” that has persisted in\n\nMontana. Opinion, ¶ 29. From this discussion, the Court concludes as follows. First,\n\nvoters had a “compelling interest” to enact the challenged statute in 1912 because “the\n\nreal social and political power [in Montana] was wielded by powerful corporate managers\n\nto further their own business interests,” and the voters were fed up with the “corrupt\n\npractices” and “heavy-handed influence” asserted by the special interests controlling\n\nMontana’s political institutions. Opinion, ¶ 36. Second, the statute “has worked to\n\npreserve a degree of political and social autonomy” from “shadowy” corporate figures\n\nwho seek to promote their own interests. Opinion, ¶ 37. And finally, there is still a\n\n                                          60\n\fsufficient interest to support the statute because “[i]ssues of corporate influence, sparse\n\npopulation, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development, location\n\nas a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs make Montana especially vulnerable\n\nto continued efforts of corporate control.” Opinion, ¶ 37.\n\n¶103 It is patently unconstitutional, however, for the government to silence a speaker on\n\nthe ground that the speaker might otherwise exert an undesired amount of “influence” or\n\n“control” in government and politics. Under such a rationale, any disfavored class of\n\nspeakers could be censored if thought to be too “influential.”        The Supreme Court\n\nunequivocally repudiated the notion that corporate political speech can be restricted “as a\n\nmeans to prevent corporations from obtaining an unfair advantage in the political\n\nmarketplace by using resources amassed in the economic marketplace.” Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 904 (internal quotation marks omitted). Austin’s holding was founded on\n\nthe same concern expressed by the Court here: that “[c]orporate wealth can unfairly\n\ninfluence elections when it is deployed in the form of independent expenditures.” Austin,\n\n494 U.S. at 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1398. The Supreme Court in Citizens United, however,\n\nheld that “Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing the Government to\n\nlimit corporate independent expenditures.” 130 S. Ct. at 913. The Supreme Court\n\n“rejected the premise that the Government has an interest in equalizing the relative ability\n\nof individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 904 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶104 “Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics,” and\n\n“[r]eliance on a generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First\n\n                                         61\n\fAmendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (ellipses in original, internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nMore to the point, the First Amendment prohibits “restrictions distinguishing among\n\ndifferent speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 898. “ ‘In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified\n\nfrom dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may\n\naddress a public issue.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 902 (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at\n\n784-85, 98 S. Ct. at 1420). The government may not bar corporations from contributing\n\nto the “open marketplace” of ideas.        Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 906.       “When\n\nGovernment seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a\n\nperson may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it\n\nuses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the\n\nfreedom to think for ourselves.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n¶105 The Court tries to distinguish Citizens United as “decided upon its facts” and\n\ninvolving only federal laws and federal elections, while this case “concerns Montana law,\n\nMontana elections and . . . Montana history.” Opinion, ¶¶ 11, 16. Yet, Bellotti involved\n\na state law, and the Supreme Court in Citizens United expressly noted that\n\n       [Bellotti] rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to\n       ban corporations from speaking.            Bellotti did not address the\n       constitutionality of the State’s ban on corporate independent expenditures\n       to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have\n       been unconstitutional under Bellotti’s central principle: that the First\n       Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a\n       speaker’s corporate identity.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (emphasis added, paragraph break omitted).\n\n                                         62\n\f¶106 Like its “influence” rationale, the Court’s “corruption” rationale is also untenable.\n\nRegardless of the history of “bribery,” “control,” and “naked corporate manipulation”\n\nrecounted by the Court, Opinion, ¶¶ 23, 25, 28, plaintiffs here do not challenge the\n\nstatutory prohibition on corporate contributions. Rather, they challenge the prohibition\n\non corporate expenditures. And the Supreme Court stated very clearly “that independent\n\nexpenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909. “When Buckley identified\n\na sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance\n\nof corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 909. “The hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for\n\npolitical favors.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n“[I]ndependent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo\n\ncorruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even\n\ningratiate. Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.” Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 910 (citation omitted).\n\n¶107 As for the Court’s fear that invalidation of § 227(1)’s prohibition on independent\n\nexpenditures by corporations will return Montana to its pre-1912 days of corruption and\n\ncorporate domination, the Supreme Court answered this concern as follows:\n\n       If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent\n       expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put\n       expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We\n       must give weight to attempts by [the legislature] to seek to dispel either the\n       appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law,\n       however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our\n\n\n                                         63\n\f       tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban\n       on corporate political speech . . . is not a permissible remedy.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911 (emphases added).\n\n                                  C. Citizen Protection\n\n¶108 The Court observes that allowing unlimited independent expenditures of corporate\n\nmoney into the Montana political process would “drastically change campaigning by\n\nshifting the emphasis to raising funds.” Opinion, ¶ 30. Direct political spending by\n\ncorporations could also “significantly affect the outcome of elections.” Opinion, ¶ 32.\n\nThe Court explains that Montana has a small population and enjoys political campaigns\n\nmarked by person-to-person contact and a low cost of advertising compared to other\n\nstates. Opinion, ¶ 30. Thus, the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or\n\nopposition to a targeted candidate would leave the average citizen candidate “unable to\n\ncompete against the corporate-sponsored candidate.” Opinion, ¶ 38.\n\n¶109 Furthermore, Montana voters feel they do not really “count” in the political\n\nprocess unless they can make a material financial contribution; and they are concerned,\n\ntherefore, that special interests hold sway. Opinion, ¶ 31. The percentage of campaign\n\ncontributions from individual voters is much less in states that do not have restrictions on\n\ncorporate spending. Opinion, ¶ 33. At present, the individual contribution limit for\n\nMontana House, Senate, and District Court races is $160 and for Supreme Court elections\n\nis $310. Opinion, ¶ 38. Thus, with the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support\n\nof or opposition to a targeted candidate, “Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have\n\nmade their modest election contributions meaningfully count[,] would be effectively shut\n\n\n                                         64\n\fout of the process.” Opinion, ¶ 38. “Clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations\n\ncreates a dominating impact on the political process and inevitably minimizes the impact\n\nof individual citizens.” Opinion, ¶ 41. The State “has an interest in encouraging the full\n\nparticipation of the Montana electorate.” Opinion, ¶ 38; accord Opinion, ¶ 41.\n\n¶110 While I understand the Court’s desire to protect the ability of citizen candidates to\n\ncompete, and the ability of citizens to meaningfully participate and be heard in the\n\npolitical process, this rationale has been rejected. “ ‘[T]he concept that government may\n\nrestrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice\n\nof others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904\n\n(brackets in original) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S. Ct. at 649). The Court’s\n\nreasoning is essentially a repackaged version of the antidistortion rationale, which the\n\nSupreme Court answered as follows:\n\n       Austin sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent\n       corporations from obtaining “an unfair advantage in the political\n       marketplace” by using “resources amassed in the economic marketplace.”\n       But Buckley rejected the premise that the Government has an interest “in\n       equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the\n       outcome of elections.” Buckley was specific in stating that the skyrocketing\n       cost of political campaigns could not sustain the governmental prohibition.\n       The First Amendment’s protections do not depend on the speaker’s\n       financial ability to engage in public discussion.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904 (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n“The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker’s wealth is a\n\nnecessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the\n\nsuppression of political speech based on the speaker’s identity.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 905. The Court’s citizen-protection theory is invalid under Citizens United.\n\n                                         65\n\f                                       D. Elected Judges\n\n¶111 The Court next discusses Montana’s interests in “protecting and preserving its\n\nsystem of elected judges,” providing “an independent, fair and impartial judiciary,” and\n\n“preserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence.” Opinion, ¶¶ 39-40.\n\nThe Court fears that “Montana judicial elections would be particularly vulnerable to large\n\nlevels of independent spending, both in terms of fairness and in terms of the public\n\nperception of impartiality.” Opinion, ¶ 44. The Court cites Sandra Day O’Connor’s\n\nrecent observation that the “ ‘crisis of confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is\n\nreal and growing.’ ”9 Opinion, ¶ 45. Noting that Montana is not immune from the\n\ninfluence of corporate-funded “super spender groups,” the Court concludes that Montana\n\n“has a compelling interest in precluding corporate expenditures on judicial elections\n\nbased upon its interest in insuring judicial impartiality and integrity, its interest in\n\npreserving public confidence in the judiciary and its interest in protecting the due process\n\nrights of litigants.” Opinion, ¶ 45.\n\n¶112 While I share some of the Court’s concerns,10 I do not believe the Supreme Court\n\nwill allow a state to single out corporations as a group and prohibit them from speaking in\n\njudicial elections.   First of all, as noted already, the First Amendment prohibits\n\n“restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not\n\n       9\n         It is somewhat ironic that the Court would cite Justice O’Connor in the context\nof discussing Montana’s “interest in protecting and preserving its system of elected\njudges,” given that she has been openly critical of this form of selecting judges. See\nRepublican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 788-92, 122 S. Ct. 2528, 2542-44\n(2002) (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n       10\n          See James C.

Rev. 299, 311 (2010).\n                                           66\n\fothers.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898. More to the point, “the First Amendment\n\ndoes not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate identity.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903.\n\n¶113 Secondly, Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S. 868, 129 S. Ct. 2252\n\n(2009), which the Court cites at ¶ 43, is of no assistance. Caperton held that a judge was\n\nrequired to recuse himself “when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a\n\nsignificant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising\n\nfunds or directing the judge’s election campaign when the case was pending or\n\nimminent.” 129 S. Ct. at 2263-64. As the Supreme Court later explained in Citizens\n\nUnited, “[t]he remedy of recusal was based on a litigant’s due process right to a fair trial\n\nbefore an unbiased judge. Caperton’s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must\n\nbe recused, not that the litigant’s political speech could be banned.” 130 S. Ct. at 910\n\n(citation omitted). In other words, recusal is the remedy for the concern with “protecting\n\nthe due process rights of litigants” (Opinion, ¶ 45), not banning corporate speech.\n\n¶114 Third, Justice Stevens raised this exact issue in his dissent, pointing out that\n\n       [t]he majority of the States select their judges through popular elections. At\n       a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a\n       fever pitch, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union\n       general treasury spending in these races. Perhaps “Caperton motions” will\n       catch some of the worst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States\n       that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on\n       corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to\n       maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 968 (citations omitted). In response, the majority certainly\n\ncould have left open the possibility that judicial elections implicate unique interests\n\n\n                                         67\n\fjustifying restrictions on corporate expenditures in that particular context. The majority\n\ndid not do so, however.11 The majority, rather, remained firm and categorical: the First\n\nAmendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate\n\nidentity, and speech restrictions aimed at reducing the relative ability of corporations to\n\ninfluence the outcome of elections are invalid. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903, 904.\n\n¶115 Lastly, the Supreme Court’s decision in White, 536 U.S. 765, 122 S. Ct. 2528,\n\nstrongly indicates that the interests cited by the Court here are insufficient for prohibiting\n\ncorporate speech in judicial elections. The Supreme Court—Justice Scalia joined by\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas—held\n\nthat the Minnesota Supreme Court’s canon of judicial conduct (the “announce clause”)\n\nprohibiting candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal\n\nand political issues violated the First Amendment. White, 536 U.S. at 788, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2542. The interests asserted in support of the announce clause were the same interests\n\nasserted by the Court in the present case:\n\n       preserving the impartiality of the state judiciary and preserving the\n       appearance of the impartiality of the state judiciary. Respondents reassert\n       these two interests before us, arguing that the first is compelling because it\n       protects the due process rights of litigants, and that the second is\n       compelling because it preserves public confidence in the judiciary.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 775, 122 S. Ct. at 2535 (citation omitted). In analyzing these interests,\n\nthe White Court considered different possible meanings of the term “impartiality.” One\n\nmeaning is the “lack of bias for or against either party to the proceeding,” which\n\n       11\n         Notably, the Supreme Court eight years earlier rejected as “not a true picture of\nthe American system” the notion that an elected judiciary is completely separate from the\nenterprise of “representative government.” White, 536 U.S. at 784, 122 S. Ct. at 2539.\n                                          68\n\f“guarantees a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law to him in the\n\nsame way he applies it to any other party.” White, 536 U.S. at 775-76, 122 S. Ct. at 2535\n\n(emphasis in original). Without stating expressly whether this was a compelling state\n\ninterest, the Supreme Court held that the announce clause’s restriction on speech for or\n\nagainst particular issues did not serve the interest in assuring equal application of the law\n\nto particular parties. White, 536 U.S. at 776, 122 S. Ct. at 2535. Another meaning of\n\nimpartiality is the “lack of preconception in favor of or against a particular legal view.”\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 777, 122 S. Ct. at 2536 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court\n\ndisagreed, however, with the proposition that “[a] judge’s lack of predisposition\n\nregarding the relevant legal issues in a case” is a compelling state interest. White, 536\n\nU.S. at 777-78, 122 S. Ct. at 2536. Likewise, the Supreme Court concluded that a third\n\npossible meaning—“openmindedness”—was an implausible basis for the announce\n\nclause. White, 536 U.S. at 778-81, 122 S. Ct. at 2536-38.\n\n¶116 Of relevance to the present discussion, the Supreme Court observed in White that\n\n“the notion that the special context of electioneering justifies an abridgment of the right\n\nto speak out on disputed issues sets our First Amendment jurisprudence on its head.\n\nDebate on the qualifications of candidates is at the core of our electoral process and of the\n\nFirst Amendment freedoms, not at the edges.” 536 U.S. at 781, 122 S. Ct. at 2538\n\n(alteration, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted). Concerning the relationship\n\nbetween judicial elections and the First Amendment, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n              There is an obvious tension between the article of Minnesota’s\n       popularly approved Constitution which provides that judges shall be\n       elected, and the Minnesota Supreme Court’s announce clause which places\n\n                                         69\n\f       most subjects of interest to the voters off limits. . . . The disparity is\n       perhaps unsurprising, since the ABA, which originated the announce\n       clause, has long been an opponent of judicial elections. That opposition\n       may be well taken (it certainly had the support of the Founders of the\n       Federal Government), but the First Amendment does not permit it to\n       achieve its goal by leaving the principle of elections in place while\n       preventing candidates from discussing what the elections are about. The\n       greater power to dispense with elections altogether does not include the\n       lesser power to conduct elections under conditions of state-imposed voter\n       ignorance. If the State chooses to tap the energy and the legitimizing\n       power of the democratic process, it must accord the participants in that\n       process . . . the First Amendment rights that attach to their roles.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 787-88, 122 S. Ct. at 2541 (second ellipsis in original, brackets,\n\ncitations, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶117 Justice O’Connor made a similar point in her concurrence:\n\n              Minnesota has chosen to select its judges through contested popular\n       elections . . . . In doing so the State has voluntarily taken on the risks to\n       judicial bias described above. As a result, the State’s claim that it needs to\n       significantly restrict judges’ speech in order to protect judicial impartiality\n       is particularly troubling. If the State has a problem with judicial\n       impartiality, it is largely one the State brought upon itself by continuing the\n       practice of popularly electing judges.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 792, 122 S. Ct. at 2544 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n¶118 Perhaps most telling are the remarks of Justice Kennedy—who, as noted, authored\n\nthe majority opinion in Citizens United. Justice Kennedy agreed that “[j]udicial integrity\n\nis . . . a state interest of the highest order.” White, 536 U.S. at 793, 122 S. Ct. at 2544\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). He also acknowledged that a state may choose to have an\n\nelected judiciary, may strive to define those characteristics that exemplify judicial\n\nexcellence, may enshrine its definitions in a code of judicial conduct, may adopt recusal\n\n\n\n\n                                         70\n\fstandards more rigorous than due process requires, and may censure judges who violate\n\nthese standards. White, 536 U.S. at 794, 122 S. Ct. at 2545.\n\n       What [a state] may not do, however, is censor what the people hear as they\n       undertake to decide for themselves which candidate is most likely to be an\n       exemplary judicial officer. Deciding the relevance of candidate speech is\n       the right of the voters, not the State. The law in question here contradicts\n       the principle that unabridged speech is the foundation of political freedom.\n              The State of Minnesota no doubt was concerned, as many citizens\n       and thoughtful commentators are concerned, that judicial campaigns in an\n       age of frenetic fundraising and mass media may foster disrespect for the\n       legal system. Indeed, from the beginning there have been those who\n       believed that the rough-and-tumble of politics would bring our\n       governmental institutions into ill repute. And some have sought to cure this\n       tendency with governmental restrictions on political speech. See Sedition\n       Act of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596. Cooler heads have always recognized,\n       however, that these measures abridge the freedom of speech—not because\n       the state interest is insufficiently compelling, but simply because\n       content-based restrictions on political speech are expressly and positively\n       forbidden by the First Amendment. The State cannot opt for an elected\n       judiciary and then assert that its democracy, in order to work as desired,\n       compels the abridgment of speech.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 794-95, 122 S. Ct. at 2545 (emphases added, internal quotation marks\n\nand some citations omitted).\n\n¶119 The principle espoused by Justice Kennedy in White—that a state may not “censor\n\nwhat the people hear as they undertake to decide for themselves which candidate is most\n\nlikely to be an exemplary judicial officer”—is consistent with the theme of the Citizens\n\nUnited opinion: “[I]t is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the\n\ngoverning rule,” 130 S. Ct. at 911, and “[n]o sufficient governmental interest justifies\n\nlimits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations,” 130 S. Ct. at 913. A\n\nfair reading of the broad holding in Citizens United, together with a fair reading of the\n\nFirst Amendment principles articulated in White, leads inevitably to the conclusion that\n\n                                         71\n\fcorporate independent expenditures can no more be prohibited in judicial elections than\n\nthey can be in legislative and executive elections.\n\n                                       E. Summary\n\n¶120 In sum, what has happened here is essentially this: The Supreme Court in Citizens\n\nUnited (and in White) rejected several asserted governmental interests; and this Court has\n\nnow come along, retrieved those interests from the garbage can, dusted them off, slapped\n\na “Made in Montana” sticker on them, and held them up as grounds for sustaining a\n\npatently unconstitutional state statute. The erroneous premise underlying the Court’s\n\nentire approach here is its belief that the Supreme Court rejected the asserted\n\ngovernmental interests only as applied to federal elections. Opinion, ¶¶ 11, 16. Nowhere\n\nin its decision did the Supreme Court state that there was something unique about federal\n\nelections that precluded the PAC-as-an-alternative theory, the antidistortion rationale, or\n\nthe anticorruption interest as justifications for restricting independent expenditures by\n\ncorporations. The Supreme Court simply rejected all of these arguments outright, in\n\nbroad and unqualified language. Not only that, the Supreme Court expressly noted that\n\n“Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the State’s ban on corporate independent\n\nexpenditures to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have\n\nbeen unconstitutional under Bellotti’s central principle: that the First Amendment does\n\nnot allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate identity.” Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (emphasis added) (citing Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 784-85, 98 S. Ct.\n\nat 1420). This Court is extremely misguided, therefore, in attempting to resurrect the\n\nrejected governmental interests under a “Montana is unique” theory.\n\n                                         72\n\f                                  V. CONCLUSION\n\n¶121 As demonstrated, the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United is clear with\n\nregard to the First Amendment’s protection of corporate political speech.         Section\n\n13-35-227(1), MCA, impermissibly restricts such speech by prohibiting corporations\n\nfrom making “an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that\n\nsupports or opposes a candidate or a political party.” The statute is, therefore, facially\n\nunconstitutional under Citizens United.\n\n¶122 That said, and as noted above, I agree, at least in principle, with the arguments and\n\nconcerns expressed by the Attorney General and the amici curiae supporting the State. I\n\nam deeply frustrated, as are many Americans, with the reach of Citizens United. The\n\nFirst Amendment has now been elevated to a vaunted and isolated position so as to\n\nendow corporations with extravagant rights of political speech and, with those rights, the\n\nexaggerated power to influence voters and elections.\n\n¶123 Professor Howell suggests that “[t]he disconnect between [Citizens United’s and\n\nCaperton’s] statements about corruption” provides Montana an opportunity to preserve\n\nits Corrupt Practices Act as applied to judicial elections. See Larry Howell, Once Upon a\n\nTime in the West: Citizens United, Caperton, and the War of the Copper Kings, at 26\n\n(available at http://mtlr.org). For my own part, I doubt that approach will be successful.\n\nIn its zeal to grant corporations unlimited rights of political speech, the Supreme Court\n\nsummarily dismissed its decision in Caperton with the statement that Caperton “is not to\n\nthe contrary” because its holding “was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused,\n\nnot that the litigant’s political speech could be banned.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n                                          73\n\f910 (emphasis added). This statement, along with the observations of the dissent in\n\nCitizens United and the statements by the majority and concurring opinions in White, lead\n\nme to conclude that Citizens United will eventually be applied to state judicial elections,12\n\nleaving recusals as the sole remedy where corporate expenditures have corrupted or\n\nbiased the judge or judges at issue.13\n\n¶124 Once Citizens United is imposed on elected state judiciaries, I am concerned—as\n\nwere Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor; as are my former colleagues\n\n(see Amicus Brief of Former Montana Supreme Court Justices William Hunt, William\n\nLeaphart, James Regnier, Terry Trieweiler and John Warner (Apr. 27, 2011)); and as is\n\nthe Court in today’s Opinion—that judicial elections will become little better than the\n\ncorporate bidding wars that elections for partisan offices have already become. I have\n\nsuggested, therefore, that Montana’s voters may—and probably should—amend the\n\nMontana Constitution to implement a merit system for selecting judges. See James C.\n\nNelson, Introduction, 72 Mont. L. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2011); cf. W. William Leaphart, First\n\nRight of Recusal, 72 Mont. L. Rev. 287 (2011) (suggesting that Montana adopt an\n\nenforceable mechanism for removing Montana justices when potential bias exists).\n\n\n\n\n       12\n           As reflected in the discussion of White (¶¶ 116-118, supra), and as I have\npreviously noted (Nelson, 71 Mont. L. Rev. at 310), the system of electing judges and\njustices presently finds little support or esteem from the appointed federal judiciary.\n        13\n           Perhaps, ironically, it will come to pass that the best way to insure that a judge\nor justice does not sit on a case involving a particular corporation is for the corporation to\nrun a vigorous and expensive campaign supporting the judge’s election.\n                                          74\n\f¶125 While, as a member of this Court, I am bound to follow Citizens United, I do not\n\nhave to agree with the Supreme Court’s decision.14 And, to be absolutely clear, I do not\n\nagree with it. For starters, the notion that corporations are disadvantaged in the political\n\nrealm is unbelievable. Indeed, it has astounded most Americans. The truth is that\n\ncorporations wield inordinate power in Congress and in state legislatures. It is hard to tell\n\nwhere government ends and corporate America begins; the transition is seamless and\n\noverlapping. In my view, Citizens United has turned the First Amendment’s “open\n\nmarketplace” of ideas into an auction house for Friedmanian15 corporatists. Freedom of\n\nspeech is now synonymous with freedom to spend. Speech equals money; money equals\n\ndemocracy. This decidedly was not the view of the constitutional founders, who favored\n\nthe preeminence of individual interests over those of big business. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 949-50 (dissenting opinion).\n\n¶126 Second, I disagree with the premise that unlimited corporate political speech is\n\nessential to “enlightened self-government” and aids the electorate in making “informed\n\nchoices.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898, 907. I agree that “[r]hetoric ought not\n\nobscure reality.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 907. But I cannot agree that the Citizens\n\n\n       14\n           Cf. J. Harvie Wilkinson III, Of Guns, Abortions, and the Unraveling Rule of\nLaw, 95 Va. L. Rev. 253, 255-56 (2009) (“It is the solemn duty of judges on the inferior\nfederal courts to follow, both in letter and in spirit, rules and decisions with which we\nmay not agree. Our oath demands it, and our respect for the Supreme Court as an\ninstitution and for the able and dedicated individuals who serve on it requires no less.\nBut esteem can likewise be manifest in the respectful expression of difference—that too\nis the essence of the judicial craft.”).\n        15\n           Milton Friedman: the guru, popularizer, and propagandist for unrestrained\nfree-market economics. See Naomi Klein, Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster\nCapitalism (Henry Holt & Co. 2007).\n                                         75\n\fUnited majority’s views reflect “reality.” For one thing, voters generally do not have the\n\ndesire, much less the time, sophistication, or ability, to sift through hours upon hours of\n\nattack ads, political mumbo jumbo, and sound bites in order to winnow truth (of which\n\nthere often seems to be very little) from fiction and half-truths (of which there\n\nunfortunately seems to be an endless supply).16 The Supreme Court believes the solution\n\nfor false or misleading speech is more speech. Yet, an endless barrage of accusations and\n\ncounteraccusations providing more fodder than fact only serves to overwhelm, confuse,\n\nand disenchant voters.\n\n¶127 Furthermore, it defies reality to suggest that millions of dollars in slick television\n\nand Internet ads—put out by entities whose purpose and expertise, in the first place, is to\n\npersuade people to buy what’s being sold—carry the same weight as the fliers of citizen\n\ncandidates and the letters to the editor of John and Mary Public. It is utter nonsense to\n\nthink that ordinary citizens or candidates can spend enough to place their experience,\n\nwisdom, and views before the voters and keep pace with the virtually unlimited spending\n\ncapability of corporations to place corporate views before the electorate. In spending\n\nability, bigger really is better; and with campaign advertising and attack ads, quantity\n\ncounts. In the end, candidates and the public will become mere bystanders in elections.\n\n\n\n       16\n         For example, the Los Angeles Times recently reported that Crossroads GPS, the\nconservative group co-founded by Karl Rove, released an ad slamming Montana Senator\nJon Tester for supporting an Environmental Protection Agency regulation on farm dust.\nHowever, one Montana cable show pulled the ad “because the network determined that it\nwas false; the regulation was actually never proposed, and the vote cited in the ad was a\nprocedural measure.” Tom Hamburger & Melanie Mason, Chamber of Commerce\nGetting Early Start with Attack Ads, L.A. Times (Nov. 16, 2011).\n                                        76\n\f¶128 Third, with respect to the interests of shareholders in not being compelled to fund\n\ncorporate political speech with which they disagree, I do not believe that participation in\n\n“corporate democracy” actually accounts for anything—unless, of course, the objecting\n\nshareholder is an insider or owns a controlling percentage of the outstanding stock. I\n\ncannot agree that “corporate democracy” will cause big business and multinational\n\ncorporations to exercise responsibly their new unlimited power to speak and spend. It\n\nwon’t, because money, influence, and access are at stake. Any notion to the contrary is\n\nsimply the triumph of hope over experience.\n\n¶129 Fourth, I absolutely do not agree that corporate money in the form of “independent\n\nexpenditures” expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates cannot give rise\n\nto corruption or the appearance of corruption. Of course it can. Even the most cursory\n\nreview of decades of partisan campaigns and elections, whether state or federal,\n\ndemonstrates this. Citizens United held that the only sufficiently important governmental\n\ninterest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is one that is limited to\n\nquid pro quo corruption. This is simply smoke and mirrors. See Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 961 (dissenting opinion). In the real world of politics, the “quid pro quo” of\n\nboth direct contributions to candidates and independent expenditures on their behalf is\n\nloyalty. And, in practical effect, experience teaches that money corrupts, and enough of it\n\ncorrupts absolutely. See e.g. Caperton, 556 U.S. 868, 129 S. Ct. 2252.\n\n¶130 Fifth, therefore, I cannot agree with the holding that the prevention of corruption\n\nin the form of independent expenditures is not a compelling state interest. There is no\n\nplausible reason why a state would not want to protect the integrity of its election process\n\n                                         77\n\fagainst corruption and undue influence; to do otherwise would render the fundamental\n\nright to vote a meaningless exercise. To my knowledge, the First Amendment has never\n\nbeen interpreted to be absolute and gloriously isolated from other fundamental rights and\n\nvalues protected by the Constitution. Yet, Citizens United distorts the right to speech\n\nbeyond recognition. Indeed, I am shocked that the Supreme Court did not balance the\n\nright to speech with the government’s compelling interest in preserving the fundamental\n\nright to vote in elections.\n\n¶131 At the same time, though, I am not persuaded that Montana’s experience with\n\ncorruption is as “unique” as the Attorney General and this Court posit. Each state has its\n\nown corruption horror stories and has battled political and election corruption at one time\n\nor another. Even a casual examination of the daily newspaper or the evening news\n\nproves that battling political corruption is ongoing; like painting the Golden Gate Bridge,\n\nwhen you reach one end, you start over at the other. It should be noted that Montana’s\n\nCorrupt Practices Act was adopted in 1912 at a time when the country’s focus was on\n\npreventing political corruption, not on protecting corporate influence. Due to intervening\n\nchanges in the composition and philosophy of the Supreme Court, that focus has now\n\nflip-flopped. See Zephyr Teachout, The Historical Roots of Citizens United v. FEC:\n\nHow Anarchists and Academics Accidentally Created Corporate Speech Rights, 5 Harv.\n\nL. & Policy Rev. 163 (2011).         Montana’s Corrupt Practices Act has become an\n\nhistorical—and unconstitutional—artifact, and it will have to be legislatively revised to\n\naccommodate a changed time and a changed Supreme Court. A number of our sister\n\n\n\n                                        78\n\fstates have modified their laws in the wake of Citizens United (see ¶ 72 n. 4, supra), and I\n\nexpect that Montana’s 2013 Legislature will, or should, be tasked with doing the same.\n\n¶132 Lastly, I am compelled to say something about corporate “personhood.” While I\n\nrecognize that this doctrine is firmly entrenched in the law, see Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 780\n\nn. 15, 98 S. Ct. at 1418 n. 15; but see 435 U.S. at 822, 98 S. Ct. at 1439-40 (Rehnquist, J.,\n\ndissenting), I find the entire concept offensive. Corporations are artificial creatures of\n\nlaw.   As such, they should enjoy only those powers—not constitutional rights, but\n\nlegislatively-conferred powers—that are concomitant with their legitimate function, that\n\nbeing limited-liability investment vehicles for business. Corporations are not persons.\n\nHuman beings are persons, and it is an affront to the inviolable dignity of our species that\n\ncourts have created a legal fiction which forces people—human beings—to share\n\nfundamental, natural rights with soulless creations of government. Worse still, while\n\ncorporations and human beings share many of the same rights under the law, they clearly\n\nare not bound equally to the same codes of good conduct, decency, and morality, and\n\nthey are not held equally accountable for their sins. Indeed, it is truly ironic that the\n\ndeath penalty and hell are reserved only to natural persons.\n\n¶133 Having said all this, I must return to the central point of this Dissent. Regardless\n\nof my disagreement with the views of the Citizens United majority, the fact remains that\n\nthe Supreme Court has spoken. It has interpreted the protections of the First Amendment\n\nvis-à-vis corporate political speech. Agree with its decision or not, Montana’s judiciary\n\nand elected officers are bound to accept and enforce the Supreme Court’s ruling—in the\n\nsame way that this Court demands obedience to its rulings, like them or not.\n\n                                         79\n\f¶134 For these reasons, I dissent from the Court’s analysis in the instant case. I\n\ndisagree with the Court’s decision to parse Citizens United in a fashion so as to “send a\n\nmessage” to, or be the next “test case” before, the Supreme Court. In my view, this\n\napproach is disingenuous. Montana is in the same First Amendment swimming pool as\n\nevery other state, and the Supreme Court has dictated that its waters are expansive and\n\ndeep when it comes to corporate political speech. Citizens United is the law of the land,\n\nand this Court is duty-bound to follow it. When this case is appealed to the Supreme\n\nCourt, as I expect it will be, a summary reversal on the merits (see U.S. Sup. Ct. R. 16)\n\nwould not surprise me in the least.\n\n¶135 In my opinion, District Court Judge Sherlock’s well-reasoned and courageous—\n\nthough politically unpopular—decision should be affirmed. I cannot agree with this\n\nCourt’s determination not to do so. Therefore, I respectfully and regretfully dissent.\n\n\n                                                 /S/ JAMES C.

The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment along with briefs\n\nand supporting materials.      The District Court declared the statute unconstitutional,\n\ngranted summary judgment for the plaintiffs and denied summary judgment to the State\n\ndefendants. The District Court enjoined enforcement of the statute and denied the motion\n\nof Champion and MSSF for an award of attorney fees. The State appeals the order of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, and Champion and MSSF cross-appeal from\n\nthe denial of their request for attorney fees.\n\n                               STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n¶3     This Court reviews a district court’s decision on summary judgment using the\n\nsame standards as the district court under M.

It provides:\n\n              (1) A corporation may not make a contribution or an expenditure in\n       connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or\n       opposes a candidate or a political party.\n              (2) A person, candidate or political committee may not accept or\n       receive a corporate contribution described in subsection (1).\n              (3)    This section does not prohibit the establishment or\n       administration of a separate segregated fund to be used for making political\n       contributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary\n       contributions solicited from an individual who is a shareholder, employee\n       or member of the corporation.\n              (4) A person who violates this section is subject to the civil penalty\n       provisions of 13-37-128.\n\nSection 13-37-128, MCA, provides the sanction for a violation of § 13-35-227, MCA,\n\nand allows the Commissioner of Political Practices to recover a civil penalty up to $500\n\nor triple the amount of the unlawful expenditure. A corporation may establish a separate\n\nsegregated fund called a political committee or PAC to make political expenditures “if\n\n\n                                         4\n\fthe fund consists of only voluntary contributions solicited from an individual who is a\n\nshareholder, employee, or member of the corporation. Section 13-35-227(3), MCA.\n\nMontana law requires that all political communications must include the name and\n\naddress of the person or entity that paid for the communication. Section 13-35-225,\n\nMCA.\n\n¶5     Champion Painting, Inc., is incorporated under the laws of Montana. It is a single\n\nproprietor painting and drywall business with no employees or members, and its sole\n\nshareholder is Kenneth Champion. It is the only business corporation in this action. Mr.\n\nChampion is personally active in county and state politics, supporting and opposing\n\ncandidates through blogs, letters to the editor, and speeches. Champion states that he\n\nwants to speak on political issues as a spokesman for his corporation and wants to spend\n\ncorporation funds to independently support or oppose candidates. He believes that doing\n\nso would be prohibited by § 13-35-227(1), MCA.\n\n¶6     MSSA is a voluntary association of persons who support and promote firearm\n\nsafety, shooting sports, education, shooting facilities and Second Amendment rights. It\n\nwas incorporated in 1990 to provide liability shelter for its officers and directors. It has\n\nno employees or shareholders and its funding comes primarily from member dues and\n\ndonations from other organizations. MSSA is led by its founder Gary Marbut, who is\n\nactive in Montana politics on behalf of the Association. He and the MSSA have operated\n\na political committee under Montana law for over ten years and publicize its grading and\n\nendorsements of political candidates in state and national elections. Marbut believes that\n\nthe MSSA “has a political presence in Montana, and a political reputation that carries\n\n                                         5\n\fsome weight with the Montana public by virtue of our long history of activism in\n\nMontana.” Nonetheless Marbut wants to use MSSA member dues to support or oppose\n\ncandidates and believes that § 13-35-227(1), MCA, prohibits MSSA from doing so.\n\n¶7     Western Tradition Partnership is an entity incorporated in Colorado in 2008 and\n\nregistered to do business in Montana. WTP reveals no more than that about itself in this\n\ncase. Evidence presented by the State in District Court and not refuted by WTP is that its\n\npurpose is to act as a conduit of funds for persons and entities including corporations who\n\nwant to spend money anonymously to influence Montana elections. WTP seeks to make\n\nunlimited expenditures in Montana elections from these anonymous funding sources.\n\nWTP’s operation is premised on the fact, or at least the assumption, that its independent\n\nexpenditures have a determinative influence on the outcome of elections in Montana.\n\n¶8     Upon the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, the District Court considered\n\nwhether § 13-35-227(1), MCA, violates the First Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution to the extent that it restricts WTP, MSSA or Champion from making\n\nindependent corporate expenditures on behalf of candidates.1 The District Court applied\n\nCitizens United v. F.E.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010) and determined that §\n\n13-35-227(1), MCA, impacts the corporations’ political speech protected by the United\n\nStates Constitution.    The District Court then considered whether the State had\n\ndemonstrated a compelling interest for the restriction on speech, and whether the\n\nrestriction is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. While it answered both questions\n\n1\n Under Montana law corporations are allowed to make independent expenditures on\nballot issues. Montana Chamber of Commerce v. Argenbright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770459\"><a href=\"/opinion/770459/montana-chamber-of-commerce-sletten-construction-lehrkinds-inc-kalispell/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n2000).\n                                         6\n\fin the negative, the District Court did not conduct a detailed analysis of the compelling\n\ninterest question.   Instead, it concluded that “Citizens United is unequivocal:        the\n\ngovernment may not prohibit independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political\n\nspeech.” (Quoting Minn. Chamber of Comm. v. Gaertner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2538481\"><a href=\"/opinion/2538481/minnesota-chamber-of-commerce-v-gaertner/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Minn.\n\n2010)). The District Court specifically did not address whether § 13-35-227, MCA,\n\nviolated the Montana Constitution, and further noted that the decision had “no effect on\n\ndirect corporate contributions to candidates or to any existing or future disclosure laws\n\nthat might be enacted.” Those aspects of Montana law are therefore not at issue in this\n\ncase.\n\n¶9      We take note that Western Tradition appears to be engaged in a multi-front attack\n\non both contribution restrictions and the transparency that accompanies campaign\n\ndisclosure requirements. In addition to this case, it is currently engaged in separate\n\nlitigation in the same District Court involving the Montana laws on campaign spending\n\ndisclosures. Western Tradition Partnership v. Gallik, Cause BDV 2010-1120 (Mont. 1st\n\nJud. Dist. Ct.).2 In another action filed in United States District Court in September,\n\n2011, WTP, under its new name of American Tradition Partnership, and with others,\n\nchallenges the constitutionality of most of the limits and disclosure requirements\n\ncontained in § 13-37-216, MCA. Lair, et al., v. Gallik, et al., United States District Court\n\n\n2\n  In a decision in October, 2010, the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices found\nthat WTP had created a sham organization through which to channel campaign funds, and\nthat its arguments to the contrary were deceptive. The Commissioner further concluded\nthat WTP’s failure to register as a political committee and to disclose the true source and\ndisposition of the funds it raised “frustrates the purpose of Montana’s Campaign Finance\nand Practices Act [and] raises the specter of corruption of the electoral process. . . . ”\n                                         7\n\ffor the District of Montana, Billings Division. Ironically, perhaps, WTP argued in the\n\nDistrict Court and in its oral presentation to this Court on appeal that their compliance\n\nwith these same disclosure laws that it now seeks to invalidate should remedy any\n\nconcerns regarding the potential corrupting influence of its unlimited corporate\n\nexpenditures.\n\n¶10    The District Court erroneously construed and applied the Citizens United case.\n\nThat case considered the constitutionality of Federal statutes and regulations that\n\nprohibited corporations from “electioneering” (making a communication that refers to a\n\nclearly identified candidate for Federal office) within 30 days of a primary election or 60\n\ndays of a general election.\n\n¶11    Citizens United was a case decided upon its facts, and involved “unique and\n\ncomplex” rules that affected 71 distinct entities and included separate rules for 33\n\ndifferent types of speech in Federal elections.       Since 1975, the Federal Election\n\nCommission adopted 568 pages of regulations, 1,278 pages of explanatory materials, and\n\n1,771 advisory opinions to implement and enforce the Federal law. The FEC adopted a\n\ntwo-part, 11-factor test in response to the holding in a single Supreme Court decision. If\n\nparties want to avoid litigation and possible penalties they must either refrain from\n\npolitical speech or seek an advisory opinion. All of this, the Supreme Court found,\n\nallows the FEC to “select what political speech is safe for public consumption by\n\napplying ambiguous tests.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 895-96. The Court determined\n\nthat the law was “an outright ban, backed by criminal sanctions.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 897.\n\n                                         8\n\f¶12    A premise of Citizens United was that First Amendment protections extend to\n\ncorporations. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899. The Court additionally determined that\n\nthe option for a corporation to spend through a separate PAC was not a sufficient\n\nalternative because of the burdensome, extensive, and expensive Federal regulations that\n\napplied.   The Federal law allowed corporations to form a separate segregated fund\n\n(sometimes called a political action committee or PAC) as long as the funds were limited\n\nto donations from stockholders or, in the case of unions, its members. The Court found\n\nthe regulations governing the organization of PACs to be “onerous” restrictions that\n\nmight not allow a corporation to establish a PAC in time to make its views known in a\n\ncurrent campaign.    Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898. Therefore, because the Federal\n\nlaws and regulations severely restricted speech, their constitutionality could be\n\nmaintained only upon a showing that they further a compelling governmental interest\n\nand are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\n¶13    The Court found that the Government did not claim that corporate expenditures\n\nhad actually corrupted the political process and concluded that “independent\n\nexpenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909. However, if elected\n\nofficials do succumb to improper influences from independent expenditures, “then surely\n\nthere is cause for concern.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n¶14    The Court determined that the government had not provided a compelling interest\n\nto justify the speech restrictions at issue. The Court considered and rejected arguments\n\nthat preventing the distorting effect of large expenditures; preventing corruption or the\n\n                                          9\n\fappearance of corruption; or protection of dissenting shareholders were sufficient\n\ninterests to support the Federal restrictions. Therefore, finding no compelling interest for\n\nthe Federal restrictions on corporate political speech through independent expenditures,\n\nthe Court found an impermissible contravention of the First Amendment.             Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n¶15    While Citizens United was decided under its facts or lack of facts, 3 it applied the\n\nlong-standing rule that restrictions upon speech are not per se unlawful, but rather may be\n\nupheld if the government demonstrates a sufficiently strong interest.

The Supreme Court in Citizens United applied the highest level of\n\nscrutiny to the restrictions at issue there, requiring the government to demonstrate a\n\ncompelling interest, although the level of evidence needed to satisfy heightened scrutiny\n\nwill vary with the “novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.” Nixon v.

The Supreme Court held that laws that burden political speech are subject\n\n\n3\n  The Court noted, for example, the “scant evidence” of the effects of independent\nexpenditures. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910.\n                                         10\n\fto strict scrutiny, which requires the government to prove that the law furthers a\n\ncompelling state interest and is narrowly tailored to that interest.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2663-64 (2007),\n\nclearly endorsed an analysis of restrictions on speech, placing the burden upon the\n\ngovernment to establish a compelling interest. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898. Here\n\nthe government met that burden.\n\n¶16   In this case both sides moved the District Court for summary judgment. The WTP\n\nparties conducted no discovery in the case and presented two brief affidavits, one from\n\nthe MSSF and one from Mr. Champion in support of summary judgment. The State\n\npresented a more extensive record consisting of the deposition transcripts of both Mr.\n\nChampion and Mr. Marbut of the MSSF, along with seven affidavits and attached\n\nexhibits. The plaintiffs did not contest any of this evidence. Nonetheless, the District\n\nCourt failed to give adequate consideration to the record in determining whether the State\n\nhad demonstrated a compelling interest for the restrictions imposed by § 13-35-227(1),\n\nMCA. We do so now because, unlike Citizens United, this case concerns Montana law,\n\nMontana elections and it arises from Montana history.\n\n¶17   First, the depositions of Marbut (on behalf of MSSF) and Champion demonstrate\n\nthat both have been very active politically in Montana on a range of issues that concern\n\nthem. Neither could demonstrate any material way in which Montana law hindered or\n\ncensored their political activity or speech. Mr. Marbut, on behalf of MSSF, has been an\n\nactive fixture in Montana politics and in the legislative process for many years. He stated\n\nthat he believed that while Montana law allowed MSSF to obtain and spend donations\n\n                                        11\n\ffrom other organizations on political activities, it did not allow MSSF to use dues paid by\n\nits members for the same purposes. No such distinction appears in Montana law, and the\n\naffidavit of the Commissioner of Political Practices affirms his construction of Montana\n\nlaw that it places no such restriction on MSSF. MSSF, therefore, failed to demonstrate\n\nthat its speech was impaired by the statute.\n\n¶18    Similarly, Mr. Champion described his many political activities both on a local\n\nand state level. He affirmed that he regularly speaks, blogs, and meets with others, and\n\nhas run for public office. His complaint was that he believed that Montana law prohibits\n\nhim from telling his audiences and readers that his company, Champion Painting, also\n\nsupports his views. Mr. Champion believes that a candidate endorsement by “Champion\n\nPainting, Inc.” would be more persuasive than his personal endorsement, and that if his\n\nbusiness spends money on political events he will enjoy “tax benefits.” However, in\n\nChampion’s case he is the sole shareholder and derives his livelihood from the money he\n\npays himself from the corporation.        While the statute forbids the expenditure of\n\nChampion Painting’s corporate funds to support or oppose candidates, the burden upon\n\nKenneth Champion, as a sole shareholder, to establish a political committee to advocate\n\nfor his corporation’s interests and expend funds that he will decide to contribute, are\n\nparticularly minimal. We conclude, under these facts, Champion’s political speech was\n\nsimilarly not materially impacted by the statute.\n\n¶19    WTP, as noted, has been terse in its explanations of its organization, funding,\n\nactivities, and intent. It claims to be a foreign corporation but it is not a business\n\ncorporation. Its purpose, according to un-rebutted evidence submitted to the District\n\n                                         12\n\fCourt by the State, is to solicit and anonymously spend the funds of other corporations,\n\nindividuals and entities to influence the outcome of Montana elections. In a promotional\n\npresentation directed to potential donors, WTP represented:\n\n               There’s no limit to how much you can give. As you know, Montana\n       has very strict limits on contributions to candidates, but there is no limit to\n       how much you can give to this program. You can give whatever you’re\n       comfortable with and make as big of an impact as you wish.\n               Finally, we’re not required to report the name or the amount of any\n       contribution that we receive. So, if you decide to support this program, no\n       politician, no bureaucrat, and no radical environmentalist will ever know\n       you helped make this program possible. The only thing we plan on\n       reporting is our success to contributors like you who can see the benefits of\n       a program like this. You can just sit back on election night and see what a\n       difference you’ve made.\n\nWestern Tradition Partnership, 2010 Election Year Program Executive Briefing.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n¶20    Organizations like WTP that act as conduits for anonymous spending by others\n\nrepresent a threat to the “political marketplace.” Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. at\n\n264, 107 S. Ct. at 631. Echoing that theme, the State presented evidence that WTP has\n\noperated in disregard for and without complying with Montana law, unlike MSSF and\n\nChampion. Because WTP has not disclosed its operation, it is difficult to determine how\n\nit might be impacted by § 13-35-227(1), MCA, but given the evidence presented below\n\nwe will assume there is a direct impact.\n\n¶21    Second, a material factual distinction between the present case and Citizens United\n\nis the extent of the regulatory burden imposed by the challenged law. As noted above,\n\nthe Court in Citizens United emphasized the length, complexity and ambiguity of the\n\n                                           13\n\fFederal restrictions, including the power of the FEC to determine what speech is “safe for\n\npublic consumption,” and the difficulty of establishing a PAC as an alternative to direct\n\ncorporate spending. In contrast, under Montana law a political committee can be formed\n\nand maintained by filing simple and straight-forward forms or reports. (See e.g. §§ 13-\n\n37-201 and -210; 13-35-402, MCA.) Mr. Marbut in his deposition described that MSSF\n\nhas established its own political committees and used them to actively participate in the\n\nMontana political process over a period of years. The evidence submitted by the State in\n\nthe District Court similarly demonstrates that corporations, through their political\n\ncommittees organized under Montana law, are and have been a substantial presence and\n\nactive participants in Montana politics. The many lobbyists and political committees\n\nwho participate in each session of the Montana Legislature bear witness. Under the\n\nundisputed facts here, the political committee is an easily implemented and effective\n\nalternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in political speech. This alternative\n\nis available to any corporation in Montana, and to MSSF and Champion, as well as WTP\n\nshould they choose to comply with existing Montana law. In the case of MSSF the\n\nevidence shows that it has in fact effectively used the political committee form for years\n\nand there is no showing that it could not continue to do so.\n\n¶22    Third, the Montana law at issue in this case cannot be understood outside the\n\ncontext of the time and place it was enacted, during the early twentieth century.\n\n(Montana became a state in 1889.) Those tumultuous years were marked by rough\n\ncontests for political and economic domination primarily in the mining center of Butte,\n\nbetween mining and industrial enterprises controlled by foreign trusts or corporations.\n\n                                         14\n\fThese disputes had profound long-term impacts on the entire State, including issues\n\nregarding the judiciary, the location of the state capitol, the procedure for election of U.S.\n\nSenators, and the ownership and control of virtually all media outlets in the State.\n\n¶23    Examples of well-financed corruption abound. In the fight over mineral rights\n\nbetween entrepreneur F. Augustus Heinze and the Anaconda Company, then controlled\n\nby Standard Oil, Heinze managed to control the two State judges in Butte, who routinely\n\ndecided cases in his favor. K. Ross Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 196-99 (Univ.\n\nof Okla. Press 1959) the Butte judges denied being bribed, but one of them admitted that\n\nAnaconda representatives had offered him $250,000 cash to sign an affidavit that Heinze\n\nhad bribed him. Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 204.\n\n¶24    In response to the legal conflicts with Heinze, in 1903 Anaconda/Standard closed\n\ndown all its industrial and mining operations (but not the many newspapers it controlled),\n\nthrowing 4/5 of the labor force of Montana out of work. Toole, Montana, An Uncommon\n\nLand, 206. Its price for sending its employees back to work was that the Governor call a\n\nspecial session of the Legislature to enact a measure that would allow Anaconda to avoid\n\nhaving to litigate in front of the Butte judges. The Governor and Legislature capitulated\n\nand the statute survives. See e.g. Patrick v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889750\"><a href=\"/opinion/889750/patrick-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 17-23, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"889750\"><a href=\"/opinion/889750/patrick-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n¶25    W. A. Clark, who had amassed a fortune from the industrial operations in Butte,\n\nset his sights on the United States Senate. In 1899, in the wake of a large number of\n\nsuddenly affluent members, the Montana Legislature elected Clark to the U. S. Senate.\n\nClark admitted to spending $272,000 in the effort and the estimated expense was over\n\n                                          15\n\f$400,000.    Complaints of Clark’s bribery of the Montana Legislature led to an\n\ninvestigation by the U. S. Senate in 1900. The Senate investigating committee concluded\n\nthat Clark had won his seat through bribery and unseated him. The Senate committee\n\n“expressed horror at the amount of money which had been poured into politics in\n\nMontana elections . . . and expressed its concern with respect to the general aura of\n\ncorruption in Montana.” Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 186-94.\n\n¶26    In a demonstration of extraordinary boldness, Clark returned to Montana, caused\n\nthe Governor to leave the state on a ruse and, with assistance of the supportive Lt.\n\nGovernor, won appointment to the very U. S. Senate seat that had just been denied him.\n\nToole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 192-93.             When the Senate threatened to\n\ninvestigate and unseat Clark a second time, he resigned. Clark eventually won his Senate\n\nseat after spending enough on political campaigns to seat a Montana Legislature\n\nfavorable to his candidacy.\n\n¶27   After the Anaconda Company cleared itself of opposition from Heinze and others,\n\nit controlled 90% of the press in the state and a majority of the legislature. C. B.\n\nGlasscock, The War of the Copper Kings, 290 (Grosset & Dunlap, N.Y. 1935). By 1915\n\nthe company, after having acquired all of Clark’s holdings as well as many others,\n\n“clearly dominated the Montana economy and political order . . . [and] local folks now\n\nfound themselves locked in the grip of a corporation controlled from Wall Street and\n\ninsensitive to their concerns.” Michael Malone and Richard Roeder, Montana, a History\n\nof Two Centuries, 176 (Univ. of Wash. Press, Seattle 1976). Even at that time it was\n\nevident that industrial corporations controlled the state “thus converting the state\n\n                                       16\n\fgovernment into a political instrument for the furthering and accomplishment of\n\nlegislation and the execution of laws favorable to the absentee stockholders of the large\n\ncorporations and inimical to the economic interests of the wage earning and farming\n\nclasses who constitute by far the larger percentage of the population in Montana.” Helen\n\nFisk Sanders, History of Montana, Vol. 1, 429-30 (Lewis Pub. Co. 1913).\n\n¶28   In 1900 Clark himself testified in the United States Senate that “[m]any people\n\nhave become so indifferent to voting” in Montana as a result of the “large sums of money\n\nthat have been expended in the state. . . . ” Toole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 184-\n\n85. This naked corporate manipulation of the very government (Governor and\n\nLegislature) of the State ultimately resulted in populist reforms that are still part of\n\nMontana law. In 1906 the people voted to amend the state Constitution to allow for voter\n\ninitiatives. Not long thereafter, in 1906 this new initiative power was used to enact\n\nreforms including primary elections to choose political candidates; the direct election of\n\nUnited States Senators; and the Corrupt Practices Act, part of which survives as § 13-35-\n\n227, MCA, at issue in this case.\n\n¶29   The State of Montana was still contending with corporate domination even in the\n\nmid-20th century.     For example, the Anaconda Company maintained controlling\n\nownership of all but one of Montana’s major newspapers until 1959. Writing in 1959,\n\nhistorian K. Ross Toole so noted and described the state:\n\n      Today the influence of the Anaconda Company in the state legislature is\n      unspectacular but very great. It has been a long time since the company\n      showed the mailed fist. But no informed person denies its influence or the\n      fact that the basic use to which it is put is to maintain the status quo—to\n\n                                        17\n\f       keep taxes down, not to rock the boat. Few of the company personnel\n       either in Butte or in New York remember F. Augustus Heinze, or even for\n       that matter, [U. S. Senator] Joseph M. Dixon, but it would be foolish for\n       anyone to deny that the pervasive influence of the Anaconda Company in\n       Montana politics is part and parcel of the Montana heritage.\n\nToole, Montana, An Uncommon Land, 244. A study of Montana in the early 1970s\n\nconcluded that corporate influence of the Anaconda Company had been “replaced by a\n\ncorporate power structure, with interlocked directorates, the same law firms and common\n\nbusiness interests” among the Anaconda Company, Montana Power Company,\n\nBurlington Northern Railway and the First Bank System. Malone and Roeder, Montana,\n\na History of Two Centuries, 290. History professor Dr. Harry Fritz, in his affidavit\n\npresented in the District Court, affirmed that the “dangers of corporate influence remain\n\nin Montana” because the resources upon which its economy depends in turn depend upon\n\ndistant markets. He affirmed: “What was true a century ago is as true today: distant\n\ncorporate interests mean that corporate dominated campaigns will only work ‘in the\n\nessential interest of outsiders with local interests a very secondary consideration.’”\n\nWhile specific corporate interests come and go in Montana, they are always present.\n\nMontana’s mineral wealth, for example, has historically been exported from the State,\n\nand that is still true today.

The corporate\n\npower that can be exerted with unlimited political spending is still a vital interest to the\n\npeople of Montana.\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f¶30    Furthermore, in the evidence presented below the State demonstrated aptly how\n\neven small expenditures of money can impact Montana elections. The State submitted\n\naffidavits from two respected and experienced politicians and public servants. Bob\n\nBrown, a Republican, served in the Montana House of Representative, in the Montana\n\nSenate, as the Montana Secretary of State and as an unsuccessful candidate for Governor.\n\nHe retired in 2010 as a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Rocky Mountain West and the\n\nMansfield Center, at the University of Montana. Mike Cooney, a Democrat, served in the\n\nMontana House of Representatives, in the Montana Senate, as the Montana Secretary of\n\nState, and also as an unsuccessful candidate for Governor. Both affirmed that Montana,\n\nwith its small population, enjoys political campaigns marked by person-to-person contact\n\nand a low cost of advertising compared to other states. They affirmed that allowing\n\nunlimited independent expenditures of corporate money into the Montana political\n\nprocess would drastically change campaigning by shifting the emphasis to raising funds.\n\n¶31    Cooney, for example, ran his first state legislative campaign for $750 as a\n\n“grassroots” effort that he believed could have been derailed by an opposing expenditure\n\nof even a couple of thousand dollars. Brown affirmed that Montana politics are more\n\nsusceptible to corruption than Federal campaigns, and that infusions of large amounts of\n\ncorporate independent expenditure on just media coverage “could accomplish the same\n\ntype of corruption of Montana politics as that which led to the enactment of” § 13-35-\n\n227, MCA. Cooney recounted his experience from his most recent campaign when he\n\nfound that voters were concerned that they “didn’t really count” in the political process\n\nunless they can make a material financial contribution, and that special interests therefore\n\n                                         19\n\fhold sway. This is much the same sentiment described by W. A. Clark to the United\n\nStates Senate committee over a century ago, quoted above.\n\n¶32    The State also presented the affidavit of Edwin Bender of the National Institute on\n\nMoney in State Politics. He confirmed that under Montana law corporations can now\n\nmake unlimited contributions (in amount) for independent expenditures from their\n\ncorporate PACs to support or oppose candidates, directly to ballot measure committees,\n\nand to support or oppose ballot measures, and can make unlimited expenditures on\n\nlobbyists. Corporations can make contributions with the same limits as all donors from\n\ntheir PACs to candidates and to party committees. Bender also affirmed the low cost of\n\npolitical races in Montana, in comparison to other states,4 with all legislative and\n\nstatewide candidates for office raising a total of around $7 million in 2008. In that year\n\nthe average candidate for the Montana House raised $7,475 and the average candidate for\n\nthe Montana Senate raised $13,299. This makes it possible for direct political spending\n\nby corporations to significantly affect the outcome of elections.\n\n¶33    Bender also affirmed that studies of election spending in the United States show\n\nthat the percentage of campaign contributions from individual voters drops sharply from\n\n48% in states with restrictions on corporate spending to 23% in states without. Evidence\n\npresented in the District Court showed that in recent years in Montana, corporate\n\nindependent spending on ballot issues has far exceeded spending from other sources. He\n\nprovided an extensive 2010 joint study by the Hofstra University School of Law, the\n\n\n4\n  Montana is the fourth largest state in size, covering over 145,000 square miles, and has\na population less than one million people.\n                                         20\n\fBrandeis Center at the NYU School of Law and the National Institute on Money in State\n\nPolitics that concluded that polling shows that 3 of 4 Americans believe that campaign\n\ncontributions affect judicial decisions in states where judges are elected.

At that time the State of Montana and its government were operating\n\nunder a mere shell of legal authority, and the real social and political power was wielded\n\nby powerful corporate managers to further their own business interests. The voters had\n\nmore than enough of the corrupt practices and heavy-handed influence asserted by the\n\nspecial interests controlling Montana’s political institutions. Bribery of public officials\n\nand unlimited campaign spending by the mining interests were commonplace and well\n\nknown to the public. Referring to W. A. Clark, but describing the general state of affairs\n\nin Montana, Mark Twain wrote in 1907 that Clark “is said to have bought legislatures and\n\njudges as other men buy food and raiment. By his example he has so excused and so\n\nsweetened corruption that in Montana it no longer has an offensive smell.” Mark Twain,\n\nMark Twain in Eruption, 72 (Harper & Bros. 1940).\n\n¶37    The question then, is when in the last 99 years did Montana lose the power or\n\ninterest sufficient to support the statute, if it ever did. If the statute has worked to\n\npreserve a degree of political and social autonomy is the State required to throw away its\n\nprotections because the shadowy backers of WTP seek to promote their interests? Does a\n\nstate have to repeal or invalidate its murder prohibition if the homicide rate declines? We\n\nthink not. Issues of corporate influence, sparse population, dependence upon agriculture\n\nand extractive resource development, location as a transportation corridor, and low\n\ncampaign costs make Montana especially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate\n\ncontrol to the detriment of democracy and the republican form of government. Clearly\n\n                                        22\n\fMontana has unique and compelling interests to protect through preservation of this\n\nstatute.\n\n¶38    While Montana has a clear interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral\n\nprocess, it also has an interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana\n\nelectorate. The unrefuted evidence submitted by the State in the District Court through\n\nthe affidavit of Edwin Bender demonstrates that individual voter contributions are\n\ndiminished from 48% of the total raised by candidates in states where a corporate\n\nspending ban has been in place to 23% of the total raised by candidates in states that\n\npermit unlimited corporate spending. The point is illustrative of Montana, a state where\n\ncitizens generally support candidates with modest campaign donations. In the case of\n\nballot issues, where corporations may make unlimited donations, the characteristics of\n\ndonors are markedly different from those who give to candidates. In 2004, for example,\n\n97 institutional donors gave 95% of the total money raised in ballot initiative campaigns,\n\nwhile 760 individual donors accounted for the remaining 5%. Similarly, in 2008, 34\n\ninstitutional donors gave 95% of the total money donated to ballot campaigns. Moreover,\n\nunlimited corporate money would irrevocably change the dynamic of local Montana\n\npolitical office races, which have historically been characterized by the low-dollar, broad-\n\nbased campaigns run by Montana candidates. At present, the individual contribution\n\nlimit for Montana House, Senate and District Court races is $160, and for Supreme Court\n\nelections it is $310. Section 13-37-216, MCA, as adjusted as provided in (4). With the\n\ninfusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or opposition to a targeted candidate,\n\nthe average citizen candidate would be unable to compete against the corporate-\n\n                                         23\n\fsponsored candidate, and Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have made their\n\nmodest election contributions meaningfully count would be effectively shut out of the\n\nprocess.\n\n¶39    Montana also has a compelling interest in protecting and preserving its system of\n\nelected judges. In this State, the people elect the Justices of the Supreme Court, the\n\nJudges of the District Courts, and most lower court judges as well. Mont. Const. art. VII,\n\n§ 8; § 3-2-101, MCA; and § 3-5-201, MCA. Judicial elections are nonpartisan. Section\n\n13-14-111, MCA. When only an incumbent is running for a judicial seat, the voters can\n\napprove or reject the candidate. Mont. Const. art. VII, § 8 (e).\n\n¶40    The people of the State of Montana have a continuing and compelling interest in,\n\nand a constitutional right to, an independent, fair and impartial judiciary. The State has a\n\nconcomitant interest in preserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence\n\nso as to maintain the public’s trust and confidence. In the present case, the free speech\n\nrights of the corporations are no more important than the due process rights of litigants in\n\nMontana courts to a fair and independent judiciary, and both are constitutionally\n\nprotected. The Bill of Rights does not assign priorities as among the rights it guarantees.\n\nNeb. Press Assoc. v.

As to\n\ncandidates for political office, § 13-35-227(1), MCA, is designed to further the\n\ncompelling interest of the people of Montana in strong voter participation in the process.\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fWhile corporations have first amendment rights in political speech, they do not have the\n\nvote.\n\n¶42     The importance of and compelling interest in an independent judiciary is reflected\n\nas a matter of policy in Montana’s Code of Judicial Conduct.\n\n        An independent, fair and impartial judiciary is indispensable to our system\n        of justice. The United States legal system is based upon the principle that\n        an independent, impartial, and competent judiciary, composed of men and\n        women of integrity, will interpret and apply the law that governs our\n        society.\n\nMont. Code of Judicial Conduct, Preamble. Montana expects its judges to act to promote\n\n“public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary” and\n\nto “avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.”         Mont. Code of Judicial\n\nConduct, Rule 1.2. Because it is the duty of a judge to make decisions based upon the\n\nfacts and law of every case, a judge must “to the greatest extent possible, be free and\n\nappear to be free from political influence and political pressure.” Mont. Code of Judicial\n\nConduct, Rule 4.2, Comment [1].          “Public confidence in the independence and\n\nimpartiality of the judiciary is eroded if judges or judicial candidates are perceived to be\n\nsubject to political influence.” Mont. Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 4.2, Comment [3].\n\n¶43     The United States Supreme Court has affirmed the importance of judicial integrity\n\nand in maintaining public respect for the judiciary.\n\n        “Courts, in our system, elaborate principles of law in the course of\n        resolving disputes. The power and the prerogative of a court to perform\n        this function rest, in the end, upon the respect accorded to its judgments.\n        The citizen’s respect for judgments depends in turn upon the issuing court’s\n        absolute probity. Judicial integrity is, in consequence, a state interest of\n        the highest order.” [Emphasis added.]\n\n                                         25\n\fCaperton v. A. T.

Litigants appearing before a judge elected after a large expenditure of\n\ncorporate funds could legitimately question whether their due process rights were\n\nadversely impacted. In the 2008 contested election for Chief Justice of the Montana\n\nSupreme Court, evidence presented by the State in the District Court indicated that the\n\ntotal expenditure for media advertising was about $60,000. It is clear that an entity like\n\nMassey Coal, willing to spend even hundreds of thousands of dollars, much less millions,\n\non a Montana judicial election could effectively drown out all other voices. The historic\n\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fHeinze-Anaconda conflict noted above illustrates the obvious negative and corrupting\n\neffects of a “bought” judiciary.\n\n¶45    Sandra Day O’Connor recently wrote in her introduction to The New Politics of\n\nJudicial Elections that the “crisis of confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is real\n\nand growing.” The Executive Summary in that same report noted a study of the nation’s\n\nten most costly judicial elections shows the extraordinary spending power of “super\n\nspender groups,” which are mostly corporate funded. Montana is not immune from such\n\ninfluence and has a compelling interest in precluding corporate expenditures on judicial\n\nelections based upon its interest in insuring judicial impartiality and integrity, its interest\n\nin preserving public confidence in the judiciary and its interest in protecting the due\n\nprocess rights of litigants.5\n\n¶46    As discussed above, the statute has no or minimal impact on MSSF and\n\nChampion. Because of this minimal impact, the State is not required to demonstrate a\n\ncompelling interest to support § 13-35-227(1), MCA. It is required only to demonstrate\n\nthe less exacting sufficiently important interest. For the same reasons discussed above\n\nwith regard to the compelling state interest, the statute is clearly supported by important\n\ngovernmental interests. Therefore, as to MSSF and Champion, it passes constitutional\n\nmuster as well.\n\n\n\n\n5\n  The State has additionally argued that it has a compelling interest in protecting the\nrights of dissenting shareholders who disagree with the political stance of corporate\nspending. We do not reach that issue because it has not been presented in the factual\nframework of this case.\n                                          27\n\f¶47     Finally, § 13-35-227(1), MCA, is narrowly tailored to meet its objectives. The\n\nstatute only minimally affects entitles like MSSF and Champion. Even if it applies\n\ndirectly to WTP, WTP can still speak through its own political committee/PAC as\n\nhundreds of organizations in Montana do on an ongoing basis. Unlike the Federal law\n\nPACs considered in Citizens United, under Montana law political committees are easy to\n\nestablish and easy to use to make independent expenditures for political speech. As the\n\nBender affidavit submitted by the State in District Court confirms, corporate PACs can\n\nmake unlimited independent expenditures on behalf of candidates. The difference then is\n\nthat under Montana law the PAC has to comply with Montana’s disclosure and reporting\n\nlaws. And as noted earlier, corporations are allowed to contribute to ballot issues in\n\nMontana, which is a significant distinction because ballot issues often have a direct\n\nimpact on corporate business activities within Montana but present less danger of\n\ncorruptive influences that have concerned Montana voters since 1912. The statute only\n\naddresses contributions regarding candidates for state political office.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n¶48    Citizens United does not compel a conclusion that Montana’s law prohibiting\n\nindependent political expenditures by a corporation related to a candidate is\n\nunconstitutional. Rather, applying the principles enunciated in Citizens United, it is clear\n\nthat Montana has a compelling interest to impose the challenged rationally-tailored\n\nstatutory restrictions. We reverse the District Court and enter summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the Montana Attorney General and the Commissioner of Political Practices and\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\fagainst WTP, MSSF and Champion. Consequently, the cross-appeal on the issue of\n\nattorney fees is moot.\n\n\n                                                  /S/ MIKE McGRATH\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n/S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n/S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ JIM RICE\n\n\n\n\nJustice Beth Baker, dissenting.\n\n¶49    I agree with Justice Nelson that we are constrained by Citizens United to declare\n\n§ 13-35-227(1), MCA, unconstitutional to the extent it prohibits independent corporate\n\nexpenditures for political speech. In my view, the State of Montana made no more\n\ncompelling a case than that painstakingly presented in the 90-page dissenting opinion of\n\nJustice Stevens and emphatically rejected by the majority in Citizens United. Though I\n\nbelieve Citizens United requires us to affirm the District Court, we must in any event\n\nanticipate the consequences should the Court’s holding today be reversed. Rather than\n\ninventing distinctions in what I fear will be a vain attempt to rescue Montana’s Corrupt\n\nPractices Act, I would construe the statute in a manner to preserve what remains of its\n\nconstitutionality and to further the legislature’s underlying intent to prevent corruption.\n\n¶50    Citizens United holds unequivocally that “[n]o sufficient governmental interest\n\njustifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Just as unequivocally, however, it allows the government to impose disclaimer\n\nand disclosure requirements on political speech because, while such requirements “may\n\nburden the ability to speak, . . . they ‘impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,’\n\n. . . and ‘do not prevent anyone from speaking[.]’” 130 S.

In light of Citizens United’s clear directive that the\n\nState cannot prohibit corporate expenditures, our review and construction of the\n\nchallenged statute should focus on preserving disclosure requirements as applied to such\n\nexpenditures in order to protect the overriding interest in preventing corruption.\n\n¶51    This Court attempts to construe statutes in a manner that avoids unconstitutional\n\ninterpretation.

That\n\nsubsection prohibits a corporation from making “a contribution or an expenditure in\n\nconnection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate\n\nor a political party.” Subsection (2) of the statute, not challenged here, prohibits a\n\nperson, candidate, or political committee from accepting or receiving a corporate\n\ncontribution.    Subsection (3) of the same statute allows “the establishment or\n\nadministration of a separate, segregated fund to be used for making political contributions\n\nor expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited from an\n\nindividual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation.”\n\n¶53    Section 13-35-227(3), MCA, when read in the context of Montana’s overall\n\ncampaign finance scheme, expresses the legislature’s intent to provide citizens and\n\nshareholders with information about sources of funds used in support of candidates and\n\nballot issues.   Under Citizens United, the State clearly may not require corporate\n\nindependent expenditures to come from a fund consisting only of “voluntary\n\ncontributions” as the language of § 13-35-227(3), MCA, now provides. Subsection (1) of\n\nthe statute still could be preserved by allowing corporate expenditures under that\n\nsubsection to be made from a “separate segregated fund” as prescribed by subsection (3),\n\n                                        31\n\fwithout applying the now-invalid requirement that “the funds consist[] only of voluntary\n\ncontributions.”\n\n¶54    I would therefore hold that the Commissioner constitutionally may extend\n\nMontana’s disclosure and reporting laws to independent expenditures by corporate\n\nentities made on behalf of candidates or political committees, just as the Commissioner\n\nhas done for corporate expenditures on ballot issue campaigns. Without such a holding,\n\nand given that the Montana Legislature will not meet in general session prior to the next\n\nelection, Montana voters may be left in the dark if § 13-35-227(1), MCA, is invalidated\n\nby the nation’s highest court.\n\n¶55    Applying § 13-35-227(3), MCA, in a constitutionally-permitted fashion to\n\nexpenditures from a corporate treasury will further the government’s interest in\n\ndisclosure requirements and will not disrupt the statute’s integrity.

Opinion, ¶¶ 22-28. Prohibition of\n\ncorporate contributions has been one means to achieve that goal; disclosure has been\n\nanother.    State Senator Miles Romney, sponsor of the 1975 amendment that first\n\nintroduced the ban on corporate spending in ballot issue campaigns, commented in part\n\nthat “everyone should know who is giving how much” and statements of contributions\n\nwould facilitate that knowledge. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., Hearing on SB 97, at 5 (Mar. 7,\n\n1975).     Through its various iterations, inducement for the legislation has been the\n\nlegislature’s desire to prevent corruption in elections. Absent constitutional authority for\n\nan outright ban on corporate spending, prohibiting application of the “voluntary\n\ncontributions” clause to expenditures made under subsection (1) will further, not\n\nfrustrate, the accountability that fosters prevention of corruption.\n\n¶57      Construing the statute to preserve its requirement for a separate segregated fund\n\nfrom which corporate expenditures are made will facilitate disclosure under requirements\n\npromulgated by the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices. The Affidavit of\n\nDennis Unsworth, submitted by the State before the District Court, described the\n\ndisclosure process in place at the present time for corporate spending on ballot issue\n\nmeasures. Unsworth stated that independent expenditures from a corporate treasury to\n\nsupport or oppose a ballot measure must be reported on the Commissioner of Political\n\nPractices’ Form C-4. The C-4 form is for “incidental political committees,” which are\n\ndefined in the Commissioner’s rules as “a political committee that is not specifically\n\norganized or maintained for the primary purpose of influencing elections but that may\n\n                                          33\n\fincidentally become a political committee by making a contribution or expenditure to\n\nsupport or oppose a candidate and/or issue.” Admin. R. M. 44.10.327(2)(c). The only\n\nother types of political committees are “principal campaign committees” and\n\n“independent committees,” both of which are committees specifically organized to\n\nsupport or oppose various candidates or issues. An independent committee includes a\n\nPolitical Action Committee.         Admin. R. M. 44.10.327(2)(b)(i).           Thus, the\n\nCommissioner’s rules treat corporate treasury expenditures as expenditures by “incidental\n\ncommittees” because the entities do not exist for the specific purpose of supporting or\n\nopposing candidates, ballot issues, or both.\n\n¶58    The integrity and purpose of the law can be salvaged by permitting the\n\nCommissioner to apply “incidental committee” status to a separate fund in a\n\ncorporation’s treasury from which election-related expenditures are made.

INTRODUCTION\n\n¶62    The Supreme Court1 could not have been more clear in Citizens United v. Federal\n\nElection Commission, ___ U.S.___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010): corporations have broad\n\nrights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to engage in political\n\nspeech, and corporations cannot be prohibited from using general treasury funds for this\n\npurpose based on antidistortion, anticorruption, or shareholder-protection interests. The\n\nlanguage of the Citizens United majority opinion is remarkably sweeping and leaves\n\nvirtually no conceivable basis for muzzling or otherwise restricting corporate political\n\nspeech in the form of independent expenditures.2\n\n¶63    As a result, the critical question presented in the case now before us is simply this:\n\nHas the State of Montana identified a compelling state interest, not already rejected by\n\nthe Supreme Court, that would justify the outright ban on corporate expenditures for\n\npolitical speech effected by § 13-35-227(1), MCA? Having considered the matter, I\n\nbelieve the Montana Attorney General has identified some very compelling reasons for\n\nlimiting corporate expenditures in Montana’s political process. The problem, however, is\n\nthat regardless of how persuasive I may think the Attorney General’s justifications are,\n\nthe Supreme Court has already rebuffed each and every one of them. Accordingly, as\n\nmuch as I would like to rule in favor of the State, I cannot in good faith do so.\n\n       1\n         I refer to the United States Supreme Court as “the Supreme Court.” References\nto the Montana Supreme Court include “the Court,” “this Court,” “we,” and “our.”\n       2\n         As the Court notes, direct contributions are not at issue here. Opinion, ¶ 8.\n\f¶64    The Court, on the other hand, views the matter differently. The Court concludes\n\nthat Montana may bar corporations from using general treasury funds for political\n\nspeech—Citizens     United    notwithstanding—because       “Montana     has     unique   and\n\ncompelling interests to protect.” Opinion, ¶ 37. What “unique” interests render Montana\n\nexempt from Citizens United? One searches the Court’s Opinion in vain to find any. The\n\nCourt states that Montana has “a clear interest in preserving the integrity of its electoral\n\nprocess” and “an interest in encouraging the full participation of the Montana electorate.”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 38. Yet, Montana is hardly unique in this regard. Every state in the Union is\n\ninterested in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging the full\n\nparticipation of its electorate. The Court asserts that Montana has interests in “protecting\n\nand preserving its system of elected judges,” “preserving the appearance of judicial\n\npropriety and independence so as to maintain the public’s trust and confidence,” and\n\n“protecting the due process rights of litigants.” Opinion, ¶¶ 39, 40, 45. But surely every\n\nstate with an elected judiciary has these same interests.       The Court also cites “the\n\ncompelling interest of the people of Montana in strong voter participation in the process.”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 41. Again, however, the people of Montana are certainly not the only people\n\nin the United States with a compelling interest in strong voter participation.\n\n¶65    The fact is that none of the interests identified by the Court are unique to Montana.\n\nWhat the Court is really saying is that Montana has a unique history and unique qualities\n\nwhich make Montana uniquely susceptible to the corrupting influence of unlimited\n\ncorporate expenditures. Indeed, the Court points to Montana’s history involving the\n\nCopper Kings—their bribery of public officials, their manipulation of state government,\n\n                                         37\n\fand their control over local judges in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Opinion, ¶¶ 22-28.\n\nBased on this history, the Court concludes that Montana voters “had a compelling interest\n\nto enact the challenged statute in 1912.”        Opinion, ¶ 36.    Furthermore, the Court\n\nconcludes that the dangers of corporate influence and domination still exist in Montana.\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 29-31. In fact, the Court asserts that Montana is “especially vulnerable to\n\ncontinued efforts of corporate control to the detriment of democracy and the republican\n\nform of government.” Opinion, ¶ 37. According to the Court, this is owing to Montana’s\n\nsparse population, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development,\n\nlocation as a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs. Opinion, ¶ 37. Given\n\nthese characteristics, the Court opines that unlimited corporate money would “irrevocably\n\nchange the dynamic of local Montana political office races, which have historically been\n\ncharacterized by the low-dollar, broad-based campaigns run by Montana candidates.”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 38. Moreover, the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or\n\nopposition to a targeted candidate would “minimize[ ] the impact of individual citizens”\n\nin the political process and leave the average citizen “effectively shut out of the process.”\n\nOpinion, ¶¶ 38, 41. Accordingly, the Court holds that Montana may flat-out prohibit\n\ndirect political spending by corporations.\n\n¶66    Respectfully, I cannot agree that this “Montana is unique” rationale is consistent\n\nwith Citizens United. And I seriously doubt this rationale is going to prevail in the\n\nSupreme Court when this case is appealed, as it almost certainly will be. For one thing, a\n\nfair reading of the Citizens United majority opinion, coupled with a fair reading of the\n\nseparate concurring and dissenting opinions, leads inescapably to the conclusion that\n\n                                         38\n\fevery one of the Attorney General’s arguments—and this Court’s rationales adopting\n\nthose arguments—was argued, considered, and then flatly rejected by the Supreme Court.\n\nMoreover, even accepting the propositions that Montana experienced an egregious period\n\nof corporate domination and political corruption at the turn of the 20th century, that\n\nMontana citizens understandably became fed up with the heavy-handed influence and\n\ncorrupt practices of special interests at the time, and that Montana to this day remains\n\nespecially vulnerable to continued efforts of corporate control, what the Court and the\n\nAttorney General have failed to recognize is this fundamental point: a ban on corporate\n\nspeech is not a constitutionally permissible remedy for these problems. This should be\n\nabundantly clear from the following passage in Citizens United:\n\n      If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent\n      expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put\n      expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We\n      must give weight to attempts by [the legislative branch] to seek to dispel\n      either the appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies\n      enacted by law, however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is\n      our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule.\n      An outright ban on corporate political speech during the critical\n      preelection period is not a permissible remedy.\n\n130 S. Ct. at 911 (emphases added).\n\n¶67   The federal law struck down in Citizens United (2 U.S.C. § 441b, as amended by\n\n§ 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002) prohibited corporations from\n\nexpressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates and from broadcasting\n\nelectioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of a\n\ngeneral election. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887, 897. The Montana law at issue here\n\nis even more categorical, prohibiting corporations from ever using general treasury funds\n\n                                       39\n\ffor political advocacy. Section 13-35-227(1), MCA (“A corporation may not make a\n\ncontribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee\n\nthat supports or opposes a candidate or a political party.”). If the federal law is facially\n\nunconstitutional, as the Supreme Court held, then I cannot envision any possibility that\n\nthe Montana law will survive the predictable appeal of this Court’s decision.\n\n¶68    Unquestionably, Montana has its own unique history. No doubt Montana also has\n\ncompelling interests in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging\n\nthe full participation of its electorate. And Montana may indeed be more vulnerable than\n\nother states to corporate domination of the political process. But the notion argued by the\n\nAttorney General and adopted by the Court—that these characteristics entitle Montana to\n\na special “no peeing” zone in the First Amendment swimming pool—is simply untenable\n\nunder Citizens United.\n\n¶69    Admittedly, I have never had to write a more frustrating dissent. I agree, at least\n\nin principle, with much of the Court’s discussion and with the arguments of the Attorney\n\nGeneral. More to the point, I thoroughly disagree with the Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nCitizens United. I agree, rather, with the eloquent and, in my view, better-reasoned\n\ndissent of Justice Stevens. As a result, I find myself in the distasteful position of having\n\nto defend the applicability of a controlling precedent with which I profoundly disagree. 3\n\n¶70    That said, this case is ultimately not about my agreement or disagreement with the\n\nAttorney General or our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the Citizens United decision.\n\n       3\n        The task is all the more distasteful in light of Western Tradition Partnership’s\nquestionable tactics and blatant hypocrisy. See Opinion, ¶¶ 7, 9, 19; Br. of Appellants\n10-11, 22-23 (Apr. 15, 2011).\n                                         40\n\fWhether we agree with the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the First Amendment is\n\nirrelevant. In accordance with our federal system of government, our obligations here are\n\nto acknowledge that the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the United States Constitution\n\nis, for better or for worse, binding on this Court and on the officers of this state, and to\n\napply the law faithful to the Supreme Court’s ruling.\n\n¶71    Granted, there are some in the legislative and executive branches of government\n\nwho would call—and, in fact, have called—for Montana to thumb its nose at the federal\n\ngovernment, to disregard federal law, and to boldly ignore the Supremacy Clause (U.S.\n\nConst., art. VI, cl. 2). See e.g. Mike Dennison, Bills Test State’s Power to Nullify Fed\n\nLaws, Helena Independent Record (Feb. 13, 2011). Regardless of those views, however,\n\nall elected officials in Montana—legislative, executive, and judicial—are sworn to\n\n“support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.” Mont. Const. art. III,\n\n§ 3. Obviously, this means in accordance with the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the\n\nUnited States Constitution. Thus, when the highest court in the country has spoken\n\nclearly on a matter of federal constitutional law, as it did in Citizens United, the highest\n\ncourt in Montana—this Court—is not at liberty to disregard or parse that decision in\n\norder to uphold a state law that, while politically popular, is clearly at odds with the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision. This is the rule of law and is part and parcel of every judge’s\n\nand justice’s oath of office to “support, protect and defend the constitution of the United\n\nStates.” In my view, this Court’s decision today fails to do so.\n\n¶72    The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected the notion that corporate political\n\nspeech may be restricted based on interests in protecting against political and campaign\n\n                                         41\n\fcorruption, safeguarding the ability of individual citizens to compete and participate in\n\nthe political process, and preserving judicial integrity and impartiality. It makes no sense\n\nwhatsoever that a state may rely on these very same interests—despite their rejection by\n\nthe Supreme Court—as grounds for muzzling corporate speech simply because the state’s\n\nhistory, demographics, economics, and elections are in some way “unique.” It also\n\nmakes no sense that, on one hand, the First Amendment protects corporate expenditures\n\nfor political speech at the federal level and, apparently, throughout the rest of the country4\n\nbut that, on the other hand, this First Amendment protection magically evaporates at\n\nMontana’s borders because of a law adopted 100 years ago to address a very fact-specific\n\nsituation. See Larry Howell, Once Upon a Time in the West: Citizens United, Caperton,\n\nand the War of the Copper Kings, at 6-16 (under the heading “The Montana Situation”)\n\n(available at http://mtlr.org). Indeed, if the Supreme Court countenances this Court’s\n\napproach of restricting corporate political speech rights based on population density, the\n\nexistence of “mineral wealth,” a history of “low-dollar, broad-based campaigns,” and past\n\nexperience with “heavy-handed influence” asserted by corporations, then there shortly\n\nwill be nothing left of Citizens United at the state level. Due to its unpopularity, the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision will be “state-lawed” into oblivion. While this would be a\n\n\n       4\n        See Robert Barnes, Citizens United Decision Reverberates in Courts across\nCountry, Washington Post (May 22, 2011) (“The [Supreme Court’s] January 2010\ndecision freeing corporations and unions to spend whatever they like for and against\ncandidates wiped out laws in 24 states banning such spending. Only Montana still wages\na lonely court battle to maintain the ban.”); Natl. Conf. of State Legislatures, Citizens\nUnited and the States, http://www.ncsl.org/default.aspx?tabid=19607 (updated Jan. 4,\n2011) (noting that “[i]n 17 of the 24 states with laws affected by the Citizens United\ndecision, legislation has been introduced to amend the law,” and listing the bills).\n                                          42\n\fgood thing in the view of many, my point here is that the Supreme Court clearly did not\n\nintend, with the broad, sweeping, and unqualified language it used, to allow the holding\n\nof Citizens United to be circumvented through “uniqueness” stratagems.\n\n¶73    Therefore, and with all due respect to my colleagues, I believe this Court is simply\n\nwrong in its refusal to affirm the District Court. Like it or not, Citizens United is the law\n\nof the land as regards corporate political speech. There is no “Montana exception.” The\n\nproof of the Court’s error is found in a comparison of the rationales provided in the\n\nCourt’s Opinion with the statements by the Supreme Court rejecting those rationales. I\n\nbegin with an analysis of the Citizens United decision.\n\n                                 II. CITIZENS UNITED\n\n¶74    A significant portion of the Citizens United decision is devoted to the threshold\n\nquestion whether the Supreme Court should even be deciding the constitutional matters\n\nthat it ultimately does decide. Indeed, the five Justices in the majority—Justice Kennedy\n\njoined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito—\n\nconsumed numerous pages attempting to explain why they were (1) addressing a claim\n\nthat Citizens United had expressly dismissed in the district court (its facial challenge to\n\nthe law’s constitutionality), (2) deciding the case on grounds that arguably were broader\n\nthan necessary to resolve Citizens United’s claim, and (3) overruling prior precedents\n\nnotwithstanding the doctrine of stare decisis. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 888-96,\n\n911-13 (majority opinion); 130 S. Ct. at 917-25 (Roberts, C.J., & Alito, J., concurring).\n\nWith regard to these issues, the dissent—Justice Stevens joined by Justice Ginsburg,\n\nJustice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor—accused the majority of simply being “unhappy\n\n                                         43\n\fwith the limited nature of the case before us,” of having “disdain” for the prior\n\nprecedents, and thus of “chang[ing] the case to give themselves an opportunity to change\n\nthe law.”5 Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 932, 938. The dissent also criticized the\n\nmajority’s determination to invalidate the statute on facial grounds, not only because this\n\napproach is “ ‘contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint’ ” and has the\n\nsecondary effect of “implicitly striking down a great many state laws as well,” but also\n\nbecause the record before the Supreme Court was “nonexistent.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 932-33. Whereas Congress had crafted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of\n\n2002 (BCRA) “in response to a virtual mountain of research on the corruption that\n\nprevious legislation had failed to avert,” the majority “now negates Congress’ efforts\n\nwithout a shred of evidence on how § 203 or its state-law counterparts have been\n\naffecting any entity other than Citizens United.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 933. The\n\ndissent argued that “it is the height of recklessness to dismiss Congress’ years of\n\nbipartisan deliberation and its reasoned judgment on this basis, without first confirming\n\nthat the statute in question was intended to be, or will function as, a restraint on electoral\n\ncompetition.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 969. Finally, the dissent argued that the case\n\ncould have been decided on various narrower grounds, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n936-38, and that the majority had failed to give proper deference to the doctrine of stare\n\ndecisis, 130 S. Ct. at 938-42. On this latter point, the dissent observed that\n\n       5\n         Unfortunately, remaking cases is not a phenomenon exclusive to the Supreme\nCourt. See e.g. Western Sec.

I approach this in step-by-step fashion.\n\n       A. The First Amendment Applies to Political Speech by Corporations\n\n¶76    The First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging\n\nthe freedom of speech.” This protection extends to corporations and to the context of\n\npolitical speech.

Ct. at 900.\n\n                 B. Section 441b Burdens Corporate Political Speech\n\n¶77    The law at issue (2 U.S.C. § 441b, as amended by § 203 of the BCRA) prohibits\n\ncorporations and unions from using general treasury funds to make independent\n\nexpenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of candidates. It also prohibits\n\nthe broadcast of electioneering communications within 30 days of a primary election and\n\n60 days of a general election. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887, 897. This prohibition\n\non corporate independent expenditures is a ban on speech. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n898. It is true that corporations and unions may establish a “separate segregated fund”\n\n(known as a political action committee or PAC) for purposes of express advocacy or\n\nelectioneering communications.      The moneys received by the PAC are limited to\n\ndonations from stockholders and employees of the corporation or, in the case of unions,\n\nmembers of the union. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887-88. Nevertheless, § 441b “is a\n\nban on corporate speech notwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation can\n\nstill speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897. This is because “[a] PAC is a separate\n\n                                         46\n\fassociation from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from § 441b’s expenditure ban\n\ndoes not allow corporations to speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (citation\n\nomitted). Furthermore, “[e]ven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to speak—\n\nand it does not—the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First Amendment\n\nproblems with § 441b.       PACs are burdensome alternatives; they are expensive to\n\nadminister and subject to extensive regulations.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897.\n\n                        C. Standard of Review: Strict Scrutiny\n\n¶78    “While it might be maintained that political speech simply cannot be banned or\n\nrestricted as a categorical matter,” the following standard “provides a sufficient\n\nframework for protecting the relevant First Amendment interests in this case.” Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 898. Laws that burden political speech are subject to strict scrutiny,\n\nwhich requires the government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest\n\nand is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\n                        D. The Governmental-Function Interest\n\n¶79    The First Amendment prohibits restrictions that distinguish among different\n\nspeakers, allowing speech by some but not others. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\nHence, the government “may commit a constitutional wrong when by law it identifies\n\ncertain preferred speakers.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899. The Supreme Court has\n\nupheld a narrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the disadvantage of certain\n\npersons, but these rulings were based on “the proposition that there are certain\n\ngovernmental functions that cannot operate without some restrictions on particular kinds\n\nof speech”—e.g., the function of public school education, the penological objectives of\n\n                                         47\n\fthe corrections system, and the capacity of the government to discharge its military\n\nresponsibilities. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899. This interest is not applicable here\n\nbecause the corporate independent expenditures at issue would not interfere with\n\ngovernmental functions. Quite the contrary, “it is inherent in the nature of the political\n\nprocess that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources in order to\n\ndetermine how to cast their votes.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899.\n\n                             E. The Antidistortion Interest\n\n¶80    The Supreme Court in Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112398\"><a href=\"/opinion/112398/austin-v-michigan-chamber-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), found a compelling governmental interest in preventing “ ‘the\n\ncorrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated\n\nwith the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public’s\n\nsupport for the corporation’s political ideas.’ ”     Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903\n\n(quoting Austin, 494 U.S. at 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1397). The concerns in this regard are that\n\ncorporations can “use resources amassed in the economic marketplace to obtain an unfair\n\nadvantage in the political marketplace,” and that corporate wealth can “dominat[e] . . . the\n\npolitical process” and “unfairly influence elections” when it is deployed in the form of\n\nindependent expenditures.     Austin, 494 U.S. at 659, 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1397, 1398\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶81    The problem with this “antidistortion rationale,” however, is that it is inconsistent\n\nwith the First Amendment. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904-08. For one thing, “ ‘the\n\nconcept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order\n\nto enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.’ ”\n\n                                         48\n\fCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904 (alteration omitted) (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48-49, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The First Amendment’s protections do not\n       depend on the speaker’s “financial ability to engage in public discussion.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904 (citations omitted).\n\n¶82    Additionally, the antidistortion rationale interferes with the “open marketplace” of\n\nideas protected by the First Amendment by permitting the government to ban the political\n\nspeech of millions of associations of citizens. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 906-07.\n\nMost of these are small corporations without large amounts of wealth—a fact which\n\nbelies the argument that the statute at issue is justified on the ground that it prevents the\n\n“distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n907. In any event, political speech is indispensable to decision-making in a democracy,\n\nand this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an\n\nindividual. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904. “Corporations, like individuals, do not\n\nhave monolithic views. On certain topics corporations may possess valuable expertise,\n\nleaving them the best equipped to point out errors or fallacies in speech of all sorts,\n\nincluding the speech of candidates and elected officials.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n912. By suppressing the speech of manifold corporations, both for-profit and nonprofit,\n\nthe government prevents their voices and viewpoints from reaching the public and\n\nadvising voters on which persons or entities are hostile to their interests. Citizens United,\n\n\n                                         49\n\f130 S. Ct. at 907. In so doing, the government muffles the voices that best represent the\n\nmost significant segments of the economy and deprives the electorate of information,\n\nknowledge, and opinion vital to its function. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 907. When\n\nthe government seeks to use its power “to command where a person may get his or her\n\ninformation or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control\n\nthought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for\n\nourselves.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n                            F. The Anticorruption Interest\n\n¶83   The Government argues that corporate political speech may be banned in order to\n\nprevent corruption or its appearance. The Buckley Court found this interest sufficiently\n\nimportant to allow limits on contributions. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (citing\n\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 25, 96 S. Ct. at 638). But when the Buckley Court examined a ban\n\non independent expenditures, it found “that the governmental interest in preventing\n\ncorruption and the appearance of corruption is inadequate to justify [the ban].” Buckley,\n\n424 U.S. at 45, 96 S. Ct. at 647. For the reasons which follow, that holding is reaffirmed\n\nhere. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908-11.\n\n¶84   “ ‘The hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for political\n\nfavors.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (quoting Fed. Election Commn. v. Natl.\n\nConservative Political Action Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-political-action-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 497, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-political-action-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct. at 909.\n\nNot only can large direct contributions be given to secure a political quid pro quo, the\n\n                                        50\n\fscope of such pernicious practices can never be reliably ascertained. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 908 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27, 96 S. Ct. at 638). Thus, limits on direct\n\ncontributions are permissible to ensure against the reality or appearance of quid pro quo\n\ncorruption. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n¶85    Independent expenditures, in contrast, have a substantially diminished potential\n\nfor abuse. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908. By definition, an independent expenditure\n\nis political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with a candidate.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910. “ ‘The absence of prearrangement and coordination of\n\nan expenditure with the candidate or his agent not only undermines the value of the\n\nexpenditure to the candidate, but also alleviates the danger that expenditures will be given\n\nas a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.’ ” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 908 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 47, 96 S. Ct. at 648). Limits on independent\n\nexpenditures, therefore, “have a chilling effect extending well beyond the Government’s\n\ninterest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n¶86    “When Buckley identified a sufficiently important governmental interest in\n\npreventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, that interest was limited to quid\n\npro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909. Two years later, the Supreme\n\nCourt purported to leave open the possibility that corporate independent expenditures\n\ncould be shown to cause corruption. See First Natl. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788 n. 26, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109836\"><a href=\"/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, “we now conclude that\n\nindependent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to\n\ncorruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909.\n\n                                         51\n\f¶87    The fact that speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does\n\nnot mean that these officials are corrupt. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910.\n\n       “Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics.\n       It is in the nature of an elected representative to favor certain policies, and,\n       by necessary corollary, to favor the voters and contributors who support\n       those policies. It is well understood that a substantial and legitimate reason,\n       if not the only reason, to cast a vote for, or to make a contribution to, one\n       candidate over another is that the candidate will respond by producing\n       those political outcomes the supporter favors. Democracy is premised on\n       responsiveness.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (ellipsis in original) (quoting McConnell v. Fed.\n\nElection Commn., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131149\"><a href=\"/opinion/131149/mcconnell-v-federal-election-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will\n\nnot cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.         As noted, an independent\n\nexpenditure is, by definition, political speech presented to the electorate that is not\n\ncoordinated with a candidate. The fact that a corporation, or any other speaker, is willing\n\nto spend money to try to persuade voters presupposes that the people have the ultimate\n\ninfluence over elected officials.     This is inconsistent with any suggestion that the\n\nelectorate will refuse to take part in democratic governance because of additional political\n\nspeech made by a corporation or any other speaker. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910.\n\n¶88    In sum, the hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for\n\npolitical favors. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910. The government has a sufficiently\n\nimportant interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or the appearance of it. Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 909. Indeed, a quid pro quo arrangement would be covered by\n\nbribery laws. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908. Independent expenditures, however,\n\n\n                                          52\n\f“do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo corruption. In fact, there is\n\nonly scant evidence that independent expenditures even ingratiate.         Ingratiation and\n\naccess, in any event, are not corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (citation\n\nomitted). Therefore, “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations,\n\ndo not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 909.   Of course, if elected officials succumb to improper influences from\n\nindependent expenditures, surrender their best judgment, and put expediency before\n\nprinciple, then surely there is cause for concern; but in attempting to dispel either the\n\nappearance or the reality of these influences, “[a]n outright ban on corporate political\n\nspeech . . . is not a permissible remedy.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n                        G. The Shareholder-Protection Interest\n\n¶89    The Government argues that corporate independent expenditures can be limited in\n\nthe interest of protecting dissenting shareholders from being compelled to fund corporate\n\npolitical speech with which they do not agree. The First Amendment, however, does not\n\nallow the government to restrict corporate speech based on a shareholder’s disagreement\n\nwith the political views of the corporation. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911. There is,\n\nfurthermore, little evidence of abuse that cannot be corrected by shareholders through the\n\nprocedures of corporate democracy. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n                                  H. Foreign Influence\n\n¶90    “We need not reach the question whether the Government has a compelling\n\ninterest in preventing foreign individuals or associations from influencing our Nation’s\n\npolitical process.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n                                         53\n\f                                       I. Conclusion\n\n¶91    Based on the foregoing, the Supreme Court overruled its decision in Austin. “We\n\nreturn to the principle established in Buckley and Bellotti that the Government may not\n\nsuppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s corporate identity. No sufficient\n\ngovernmental interest justifies limits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit\n\ncorporations.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the\n\nSupreme Court held that BCRA § 203’s restriction on electioneering communications\n\nand 2 U.S.C. § 441b’s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for express\n\nadvocacy were both invalid. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913. The Supreme Court\n\n(with only Justice Thomas dissenting) then went on to uphold BCRA’s disclaimer and\n\ndisclosure provisions against an as-applied constitutional challenge. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 913-16.\n\n                            III. THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS\n\n¶92    Before examining this Court’s rationales upholding § 13-35-227(1), MCA,7 it is\n\nnecessary to dispel some misconceptions regarding the plaintiffs’ claims.\n\n¶93    First, the Court asserts that neither Gary Marbut, the founder of Montana Shooting\n\nSports Association (MSSA), nor Kenneth Champion, the sole shareholder of Champion\n\nPainting, Inc., has demonstrated “any material way” in which Montana law has hindered\n\nor censored their political activity or speech. Opinion, ¶ 17. Of course, Marbut and\n\nChampion are not parties to this lawsuit, and their speech rights are not at issue here.\n\nHence, whether Marbut and Champion, as individuals, have been hindered or censored in\n\n       7\n           I occasionally refer to § 13-35-227, MCA, hereafter as “Section 227” or “§ 227.”\n                                          54\n\ftheir political activity or speech is totally irrelevant. The question is whether the speech\n\nrights of MSSA and Champion Painting, as incorporated entities, have been infringed.\n\n¶94    Second, the Court asserts that MSSA has failed to demonstrate that its speech has\n\nbeen impaired by § 227 because Montana law places no restriction on MSSA to spend its\n\nmembers’ dues on political advocacy. Opinion, ¶ 17. As support for this, the Court cites\n\nthe affidavit of former Commissioner of Political Practices Dennis Unsworth. What\n\nUnsworth specifically says, however, is this: “[MSSA] has been and continues to be free\n\nto spend its member dues and donations from its treasury regardless of its corporate\n\nstatus, as long as it complies with the filing requirements described above and meets the\n\ncriteria for a voluntary association.” (Emphasis added.) The affidavit of Mary Baker,\n\nprogram supervisor in the Office of the Commissioner of Political Practices, likewise\n\nstates that “there is nothing in Montana’s campaign finance laws that would prohibit\n\n[MSSA] from registering itself as a committee and making independent expenditures\n\nfrom its corporate treasury, if it meets our office’s criteria for a voluntary association.”8\n\n(Emphasis added.) According to Unsworth’s affidavit, those criteria are as follows:\n\n             A voluntary association that incorporates can spend its members’\n       dues and donations on campaign contributions and independent\n       expenditures from its treasury, if it: (1) is formed for the express purpose\n\n       8\n         An exemption for “voluntary associations” is not codified in the statute. Rather,\nit is the Commissioner’s “policy” to except such associations from § 227(1). Prior to\n2003, a narrow category of nonprofit corporations was statutorily permitted to make\ncontributions to or expenditures in connection with ballot issues, notwithstanding the\ngeneral prohibition on corporate contributions and expenditures. See § 13-35-227(1), (4),\nMCA (2001). But in light of Mont. Chamber of Commerce v. Argenbright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770459\"><a href=\"/opinion/770459/montana-chamber-of-commerce-sletten-construction-lehrkinds-inc-kalispell/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1049</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2000), which held that corporations cannot be prohibited from making\ndirect corporate expenditures in ballot initiative campaigns, the 2003 Legislature\namended the statute accordingly. See Laws of Montana, 2003, ch. 59.\n                                         55\n\f      of promoting political ideas, and could not engage in business activities;\n      (2) has no shareholders or other persons affiliated so as to have a claim on\n      its assets or earnings; (3) is not established by a business corporation, and\n      does not accept contributions from business corporations.\n\n¶95   Contrary to the Court’s implication, there has been no determination in this case\n\nthat MSSA in fact meets the criteria of a “voluntary association.” And one of the exhibits\n\nattached to Unsworth’s affidavit indicates that MSSA does not satisfy the criteria. The\n\nexhibit is an “advisory opinion” issued by former Commissioner Linda Vaughey on\n\nSeptember 25, 2003, in which she addresses whether the nonprofit corporation People for\n\nResponsible Government (PRG) may engage in political activities in connection with\n\ncandidates for public office. Vaughey starts with the premise that § 227 “appears on its\n\nface to prohibit all corporations, including nonprofit corporations, from making\n\ncontributions or expenditures in connection with candidates, other than through separate,\n\nsegregated funds.” Vaughey then observes that, based on Fed. Election Commn. v. Mass.\n\nCitizens for Life, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-for-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263-64, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-for-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631 (1986), there is an\n\nexception for nonprofit corporations which meet the three criteria listed above. Vaughey\n\nfinally determines that PRG does not meet the third criterion because\n\n      [n]othing in the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, or the other\n      information you have provided confirms that PRG was not established by a\n      business corporation or a labor organization. Moreover, you have not\n      provided any information establishing that PRG does not directly or\n      indirectly accept donations or contributions of anything of value from\n      business corporations or labor organizations. [Emphasis added.]\n\nLikewise here, there is no evidence in the record—not in Marbut’s affidavit, in MSSA’s\n\nArticles of Incorporation (attached to Marbut’s affidavit), in Unsworth’s affidavit, in\n\nBaker’s affidavit, or in any other document—establishing that MSSA “does not directly\n\n                                        56\n\for indirectly accept donations or contributions of anything of value from business\n\ncorporations or labor organizations.” Hence, MSSA does not qualify as a “voluntary\n\nassociation” under the Commissioner’s definition, and MSSA is not allowed to use its\n\ngeneral treasury funds to make independent expenditures in connection with candidate\n\nelections.   MSSA states in the First Amended Complaint that it wishes to “use its\n\ncorporate funds to directly support or oppose candidates.” In light of the foregoing\n\ndiscussion, § 227(1) bars MSSA from doing so. The Court is flat wrong, therefore, in\n\nstating that “the statute has no or minimal impact” on MSSA. Opinion, ¶ 46.\n\n¶96    Third, the Court likewise misstates the impact on Champion Painting. For one\n\nthing, the Court again seems to be improperly focused on Champion’s speech rights,\n\nwhich are not at issue, rather than Champion Painting’s speech rights, which are at issue.\n\nOpinion, ¶ 18. The Court also suggests that the only reason Champion Painting is\n\nparticipating in this lawsuit is so that its shareholder (Champion) can be allowed to make\n\n“candidate endorsement[s]” using the company name. Opinion, ¶ 18. Finally, the Court\n\nasserts that because Champion, as sole shareholder, can simply establish a PAC to\n\nadvocate for Champion Painting’s interests and expend funds that he will decide to\n\ncontribute, Opinion, ¶ 18, “the statute has no or minimal impact on . . . Champion,”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 46. The Court is wrong on all counts.\n\n¶97    According to the First Amended Complaint,\n\n       Champion Painting intends to spend corporate funds to educate the citizens\n       of Montana and Bozeman about political candidates and ballot issues that\n       will either positively or negatively impact Montana’s small businesses, and\n       Champion Painting intends to publicly support or oppose candidates and\n       issues relating to Montana’s small businesses. The corporate funds will be\n\n                                        57\n\f       spent to purchase TV spots and radio advertisements, and to create and\n       distribute brochures and fliers . . . .\n\nChampion’s affidavit is to the same effect: “In addition to being politically active as an\n\nindividual, I would like for Champion Painting to be politically active. . . .        Since\n\nChampion Painting is a small business, its voice will be more effective than my voice\n\nwhen supporting or opposing candidates who may have an impact on small businesses.”\n\nIt is apparent, then, that Champion Painting’s claim is about the corporation’s ability to\n\nspeak, not its shareholder’s ability to speak. And as the Court concedes, § 227(1) forbids\n\nthe expenditure of Champion Painting’s corporate funds to support or oppose candidates.\n\nOpinion, ¶ 18. Nothing in § 227 exempts corporations held by a sole shareholder. As for\n\nthe Court’s theory that Champion Painting could speak through a PAC, Opinion, ¶ 18, the\n\nSupreme Court rejected this approach as discussed above and noted again below.\n\n                                  IV. COMPARISON\n\n¶98    I now turn to a comparison of the rationales provided in the Court’s Opinion with\n\nthe statements by the Supreme Court rejecting those rationales. Again, the specific issue\n\nis the constitutionality of § 227(1)’s prohibition on corporate expenditures in connection\n\nwith a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a\n\npolitical party. The disclosure laws, the prohibition on direct corporate contributions, and\n\nthe Corrupt Practices Act as a whole have not been challenged. Opinion, ¶¶ 2, 8.\n\n                        A. The Political Committee Alternative\n\n¶99    Section 227(1) states that “[a] corporation may not make a contribution or an\n\nexpenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or\n\n\n                                         58\n\fopposes a candidate or a political party.” Section 227(3), however, provides that “[t]his\n\nsection does not prohibit the establishment or administration of a separate, segregated\n\nfund [known as a political committee or PAC] to be used for making political\n\ncontributions or expenditures if the fund consists only of voluntary contributions solicited\n\nfrom an individual who is a shareholder, employee, or member of the corporation.” See\n\nOpinion, ¶ 4.\n\n¶100 The Court asserts that, in Montana, political committees are “easy to establish,”\n\n“easy to use,” and an “effective alternative to direct corporate spending for engaging in\n\npolitical speech.” Opinion, ¶¶ 21, 47. The Supreme Court, however, stated: “A PAC is\n\na separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from [the law’s]\n\nexpenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897\n\n(citation omitted). Moreover, “[e]ven if a PAC could somehow allow a corporation to\n\nspeak—and it does not—the option to form PACs does not alleviate the First\n\nAmendment problems.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (emphasis added).\n\n¶101 The Court ignores the Supreme Court’s holding that a PAC is “separate” from the\n\ncorporation and, thus, is not a valid alternative to direct corporate expenditures. Indeed,\n\nthe Court asserts that the Supreme Court rejected PACs “because of the burdensome,\n\nextensive, and expensive Federal regulations that applied.” Opinion, ¶ 12. This is false.\n\nGranted, the Supreme Court briefly noted that “PACs are burdensome alternatives; they\n\nare expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 897. Yet, even if federal PACs were as “easily implemented” as the Court says\n\nMontana’s PACs are, Opinion, ¶ 21, the fundamental problem with PACs still remains:\n\n                                         59\n\f“A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the PAC exemption from [the\n\nlaw’s] expenditure ban does not allow corporations to speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 897 (citation omitted). Bottom line: “[Section 227(1)] is a ban on corporate speech\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that a PAC created by a corporation [as permitted under\n\n§ 227(3)] can still speak.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 897. The Court’s contrary\n\nholding is plainly wrong.\n\n               B. Anticorruption and Restraining Corporate Influence\n\n¶102 The Court cites various examples of “well-financed corruption” perpetrated by\n\nF. Augustus Heinze, the Anaconda Company, and W.A. Clark.                 Opinion, ¶¶ 23-28.\n\nNotably, some of these examples involved blatant bribery and quid pro quo corruption\n\n(i.e., dollars for political favors), but it is not clear that any of them involved independent\n\nexpenditures (i.e., political speech presented to the electorate that is not coordinated with\n\na candidate) in exchange for political favors. In any event, the Court then proceeds to\n\npaint a dismal picture of the corporate “domination” and “influence” that has persisted in\n\nMontana. Opinion, ¶ 29. From this discussion, the Court concludes as follows. First,\n\nvoters had a “compelling interest” to enact the challenged statute in 1912 because “the\n\nreal social and political power [in Montana] was wielded by powerful corporate managers\n\nto further their own business interests,” and the voters were fed up with the “corrupt\n\npractices” and “heavy-handed influence” asserted by the special interests controlling\n\nMontana’s political institutions. Opinion, ¶ 36. Second, the statute “has worked to\n\npreserve a degree of political and social autonomy” from “shadowy” corporate figures\n\nwho seek to promote their own interests. Opinion, ¶ 37. And finally, there is still a\n\n                                          60\n\fsufficient interest to support the statute because “[i]ssues of corporate influence, sparse\n\npopulation, dependence upon agriculture and extractive resource development, location\n\nas a transportation corridor, and low campaign costs make Montana especially vulnerable\n\nto continued efforts of corporate control.” Opinion, ¶ 37.\n\n¶103 It is patently unconstitutional, however, for the government to silence a speaker on\n\nthe ground that the speaker might otherwise exert an undesired amount of “influence” or\n\n“control” in government and politics. Under such a rationale, any disfavored class of\n\nspeakers could be censored if thought to be too “influential.”        The Supreme Court\n\nunequivocally repudiated the notion that corporate political speech can be restricted “as a\n\nmeans to prevent corporations from obtaining an unfair advantage in the political\n\nmarketplace by using resources amassed in the economic marketplace.” Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 904 (internal quotation marks omitted). Austin’s holding was founded on\n\nthe same concern expressed by the Court here: that “[c]orporate wealth can unfairly\n\ninfluence elections when it is deployed in the form of independent expenditures.” Austin,\n\n494 U.S. at 660, 110 S. Ct. at 1398. The Supreme Court in Citizens United, however,\n\nheld that “Austin is overruled, so it provides no basis for allowing the Government to\n\nlimit corporate independent expenditures.” 130 S. Ct. at 913. The Supreme Court\n\n“rejected the premise that the Government has an interest in equalizing the relative ability\n\nof individuals and groups to influence the outcome of elections.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 904 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶104 “Favoritism and influence are not . . . avoidable in representative politics,” and\n\n“[r]eliance on a generic favoritism or influence theory . . . is at odds with standard First\n\n                                         61\n\fAmendment analyses because it is unbounded and susceptible to no limiting principle.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (ellipses in original, internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nMore to the point, the First Amendment prohibits “restrictions distinguishing among\n\ndifferent speakers, allowing speech by some but not others.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 898. “ ‘In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified\n\nfrom dictating the subjects about which persons may speak and the speakers who may\n\naddress a public issue.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 902 (quoting Bellotti, 435 U.S. at\n\n784-85, 98 S. Ct. at 1420). The government may not bar corporations from contributing\n\nto the “open marketplace” of ideas.        Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 906.       “When\n\nGovernment seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a\n\nperson may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it\n\nuses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful. The First Amendment confirms the\n\nfreedom to think for ourselves.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908.\n\n¶105 The Court tries to distinguish Citizens United as “decided upon its facts” and\n\ninvolving only federal laws and federal elections, while this case “concerns Montana law,\n\nMontana elections and . . . Montana history.” Opinion, ¶¶ 11, 16. Yet, Bellotti involved\n\na state law, and the Supreme Court in Citizens United expressly noted that\n\n       [Bellotti] rested on the principle that the Government lacks the power to\n       ban corporations from speaking.            Bellotti did not address the\n       constitutionality of the State’s ban on corporate independent expenditures\n       to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have\n       been unconstitutional under Bellotti’s central principle: that the First\n       Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a\n       speaker’s corporate identity.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (emphasis added, paragraph break omitted).\n\n                                         62\n\f¶106 Like its “influence” rationale, the Court’s “corruption” rationale is also untenable.\n\nRegardless of the history of “bribery,” “control,” and “naked corporate manipulation”\n\nrecounted by the Court, Opinion, ¶¶ 23, 25, 28, plaintiffs here do not challenge the\n\nstatutory prohibition on corporate contributions. Rather, they challenge the prohibition\n\non corporate expenditures. And the Supreme Court stated very clearly “that independent\n\nexpenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the\n\nappearance of corruption.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 909. “When Buckley identified\n\na sufficiently important governmental interest in preventing corruption or the appearance\n\nof corruption, that interest was limited to quid pro quo corruption.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 909. “The hallmark of corruption is the financial quid pro quo: dollars for\n\npolitical favors.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 910 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n“[I]ndependent expenditures do not lead to, or create the appearance of, quid pro quo\n\ncorruption. In fact, there is only scant evidence that independent expenditures even\n\ningratiate. Ingratiation and access, in any event, are not corruption.” Citizens United,\n\n130 S. Ct. at 910 (citation omitted).\n\n¶107 As for the Court’s fear that invalidation of § 227(1)’s prohibition on independent\n\nexpenditures by corporations will return Montana to its pre-1912 days of corruption and\n\ncorporate domination, the Supreme Court answered this concern as follows:\n\n       If elected officials succumb to improper influences from independent\n       expenditures; if they surrender their best judgment; and if they put\n       expediency before principle, then surely there is cause for concern. We\n       must give weight to attempts by [the legislature] to seek to dispel either the\n       appearance or the reality of these influences. The remedies enacted by law,\n       however, must comply with the First Amendment; and, it is our law and our\n\n\n                                         63\n\f       tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule. An outright ban\n       on corporate political speech . . . is not a permissible remedy.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911 (emphases added).\n\n                                  C. Citizen Protection\n\n¶108 The Court observes that allowing unlimited independent expenditures of corporate\n\nmoney into the Montana political process would “drastically change campaigning by\n\nshifting the emphasis to raising funds.” Opinion, ¶ 30. Direct political spending by\n\ncorporations could also “significantly affect the outcome of elections.” Opinion, ¶ 32.\n\nThe Court explains that Montana has a small population and enjoys political campaigns\n\nmarked by person-to-person contact and a low cost of advertising compared to other\n\nstates. Opinion, ¶ 30. Thus, the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support of or\n\nopposition to a targeted candidate would leave the average citizen candidate “unable to\n\ncompete against the corporate-sponsored candidate.” Opinion, ¶ 38.\n\n¶109 Furthermore, Montana voters feel they do not really “count” in the political\n\nprocess unless they can make a material financial contribution; and they are concerned,\n\ntherefore, that special interests hold sway. Opinion, ¶ 31. The percentage of campaign\n\ncontributions from individual voters is much less in states that do not have restrictions on\n\ncorporate spending. Opinion, ¶ 33. At present, the individual contribution limit for\n\nMontana House, Senate, and District Court races is $160 and for Supreme Court elections\n\nis $310. Opinion, ¶ 38. Thus, with the infusion of unlimited corporate money in support\n\nof or opposition to a targeted candidate, “Montana citizens, who for over 100 years have\n\nmade their modest election contributions meaningfully count[,] would be effectively shut\n\n\n                                         64\n\fout of the process.” Opinion, ¶ 38. “Clearly the impact of unlimited corporate donations\n\ncreates a dominating impact on the political process and inevitably minimizes the impact\n\nof individual citizens.” Opinion, ¶ 41. The State “has an interest in encouraging the full\n\nparticipation of the Montana electorate.” Opinion, ¶ 38; accord Opinion, ¶ 41.\n\n¶110 While I understand the Court’s desire to protect the ability of citizen candidates to\n\ncompete, and the ability of citizens to meaningfully participate and be heard in the\n\npolitical process, this rationale has been rejected. “ ‘[T]he concept that government may\n\nrestrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice\n\nof others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.’ ” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904\n\n(brackets in original) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 48-49, 96 S. Ct. at 649). The Court’s\n\nreasoning is essentially a repackaged version of the antidistortion rationale, which the\n\nSupreme Court answered as follows:\n\n       Austin sought to defend the antidistortion rationale as a means to prevent\n       corporations from obtaining “an unfair advantage in the political\n       marketplace” by using “resources amassed in the economic marketplace.”\n       But Buckley rejected the premise that the Government has an interest “in\n       equalizing the relative ability of individuals and groups to influence the\n       outcome of elections.” Buckley was specific in stating that the skyrocketing\n       cost of political campaigns could not sustain the governmental prohibition.\n       The First Amendment’s protections do not depend on the speaker’s\n       financial ability to engage in public discussion.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 904 (citations and some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n“The rule that political speech cannot be limited based on a speaker’s wealth is a\n\nnecessary consequence of the premise that the First Amendment generally prohibits the\n\nsuppression of political speech based on the speaker’s identity.” Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 905. The Court’s citizen-protection theory is invalid under Citizens United.\n\n                                         65\n\f                                       D. Elected Judges\n\n¶111 The Court next discusses Montana’s interests in “protecting and preserving its\n\nsystem of elected judges,” providing “an independent, fair and impartial judiciary,” and\n\n“preserving the appearance of judicial propriety and independence.” Opinion, ¶¶ 39-40.\n\nThe Court fears that “Montana judicial elections would be particularly vulnerable to large\n\nlevels of independent spending, both in terms of fairness and in terms of the public\n\nperception of impartiality.” Opinion, ¶ 44. The Court cites Sandra Day O’Connor’s\n\nrecent observation that the “ ‘crisis of confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary is\n\nreal and growing.’ ”9 Opinion, ¶ 45. Noting that Montana is not immune from the\n\ninfluence of corporate-funded “super spender groups,” the Court concludes that Montana\n\n“has a compelling interest in precluding corporate expenditures on judicial elections\n\nbased upon its interest in insuring judicial impartiality and integrity, its interest in\n\npreserving public confidence in the judiciary and its interest in protecting the due process\n\nrights of litigants.” Opinion, ¶ 45.\n\n¶112 While I share some of the Court’s concerns,10 I do not believe the Supreme Court\n\nwill allow a state to single out corporations as a group and prohibit them from speaking in\n\njudicial elections.   First of all, as noted already, the First Amendment prohibits\n\n“restrictions distinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not\n\n       9\n         It is somewhat ironic that the Court would cite Justice O’Connor in the context\nof discussing Montana’s “interest in protecting and preserving its system of elected\njudges,” given that she has been openly critical of this form of selecting judges.

More to the point, “the First Amendment\n\ndoes not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate identity.”\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903.\n\n¶113 Secondly, Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(2009), which the Court cites at ¶ 43, is of no assistance. Caperton held that a judge was\n\nrequired to recuse himself “when a person with a personal stake in a particular case had a\n\nsignificant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising\n\nfunds or directing the judge’s election campaign when the case was pending or\n\nimminent.” 129 S. Ct. at 2263-64. As the Supreme Court later explained in Citizens\n\nUnited, “[t]he remedy of recusal was based on a litigant’s due process right to a fair trial\n\nbefore an unbiased judge. Caperton’s holding was limited to the rule that the judge must\n\nbe recused, not that the litigant’s political speech could be banned.” 130 S. Ct. at 910\n\n(citation omitted). In other words, recusal is the remedy for the concern with “protecting\n\nthe due process rights of litigants” (Opinion, ¶ 45), not banning corporate speech.\n\n¶114 Third, Justice Stevens raised this exact issue in his dissent, pointing out that\n\n       [t]he majority of the States select their judges through popular elections. At\n       a time when concerns about the conduct of judicial elections have reached a\n       fever pitch, the Court today unleashes the floodgates of corporate and union\n       general treasury spending in these races. Perhaps “Caperton motions” will\n       catch some of the worst abuses. This will be small comfort to those States\n       that, after today, may no longer have the ability to place modest limits on\n       corporate electioneering even if they believe such limits to be critical to\n       maintaining the integrity of their judicial systems.\n\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 968 (citations omitted). In response, the majority certainly\n\ncould have left open the possibility that judicial elections implicate unique interests\n\n\n                                         67\n\fjustifying restrictions on corporate expenditures in that particular context. The majority\n\ndid not do so, however.11 The majority, rather, remained firm and categorical: the First\n\nAmendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate\n\nidentity, and speech restrictions aimed at reducing the relative ability of corporations to\n\ninfluence the outcome of elections are invalid. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903, 904.\n\n¶115 Lastly, the Supreme Court’s decision in White, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121170\"><a href=\"/opinion/121170/republican-party-of-minn-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nstrongly indicates that the interests cited by the Court here are insufficient for prohibiting\n\ncorporate speech in judicial elections. The Supreme Court—Justice Scalia joined by\n\nChief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas—held\n\nthat the Minnesota Supreme Court’s canon of judicial conduct (the “announce clause”)\n\nprohibiting candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal\n\nand political issues violated the First Amendment. White, 536 U.S. at 788, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n2542. The interests asserted in support of the announce clause were the same interests\n\nasserted by the Court in the present case:\n\n       preserving the impartiality of the state judiciary and preserving the\n       appearance of the impartiality of the state judiciary. Respondents reassert\n       these two interests before us, arguing that the first is compelling because it\n       protects the due process rights of litigants, and that the second is\n       compelling because it preserves public confidence in the judiciary.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 775, 122 S. Ct. at 2535 (citation omitted). In analyzing these interests,\n\nthe White Court considered different possible meanings of the term “impartiality.” One\n\nmeaning is the “lack of bias for or against either party to the proceeding,” which\n\n       11\n         Notably, the Supreme Court eight years earlier rejected as “not a true picture of\nthe American system” the notion that an elected judiciary is completely separate from the\nenterprise of “representative government.” White, 536 U.S. at 784, 122 S. Ct. at 2539.\n                                          68\n\f“guarantees a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law to him in the\n\nsame way he applies it to any other party.” White, 536 U.S. at 775-76, 122 S. Ct. at 2535\n\n(emphasis in original). Without stating expressly whether this was a compelling state\n\ninterest, the Supreme Court held that the announce clause’s restriction on speech for or\n\nagainst particular issues did not serve the interest in assuring equal application of the law\n\nto particular parties. White, 536 U.S. at 776, 122 S. Ct. at 2535. Another meaning of\n\nimpartiality is the “lack of preconception in favor of or against a particular legal view.”\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 777, 122 S. Ct. at 2536 (emphasis in original). The Supreme Court\n\ndisagreed, however, with the proposition that “[a] judge’s lack of predisposition\n\nregarding the relevant legal issues in a case” is a compelling state interest. White, 536\n\nU.S. at 777-78, 122 S. Ct. at 2536. Likewise, the Supreme Court concluded that a third\n\npossible meaning—“openmindedness”—was an implausible basis for the announce\n\nclause. White, 536 U.S. at 778-81, 122 S. Ct. at 2536-38.\n\n¶116 Of relevance to the present discussion, the Supreme Court observed in White that\n\n“the notion that the special context of electioneering justifies an abridgment of the right\n\nto speak out on disputed issues sets our First Amendment jurisprudence on its head.\n\nDebate on the qualifications of candidates is at the core of our electoral process and of the\n\nFirst Amendment freedoms, not at the edges.” 536 U.S. at 781, 122 S. Ct. at 2538\n\n(alteration, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted). Concerning the relationship\n\nbetween judicial elections and the First Amendment, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n              There is an obvious tension between the article of Minnesota’s\n       popularly approved Constitution which provides that judges shall be\n       elected, and the Minnesota Supreme Court’s announce clause which places\n\n                                         69\n\f       most subjects of interest to the voters off limits. . . . The disparity is\n       perhaps unsurprising, since the ABA, which originated the announce\n       clause, has long been an opponent of judicial elections. That opposition\n       may be well taken (it certainly had the support of the Founders of the\n       Federal Government), but the First Amendment does not permit it to\n       achieve its goal by leaving the principle of elections in place while\n       preventing candidates from discussing what the elections are about. The\n       greater power to dispense with elections altogether does not include the\n       lesser power to conduct elections under conditions of state-imposed voter\n       ignorance. If the State chooses to tap the energy and the legitimizing\n       power of the democratic process, it must accord the participants in that\n       process . . . the First Amendment rights that attach to their roles.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 787-88, 122 S. Ct. at 2541 (second ellipsis in original, brackets,\n\ncitations, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n¶117 Justice O’Connor made a similar point in her concurrence:\n\n              Minnesota has chosen to select its judges through contested popular\n       elections . . . . In doing so the State has voluntarily taken on the risks to\n       judicial bias described above. As a result, the State’s claim that it needs to\n       significantly restrict judges’ speech in order to protect judicial impartiality\n       is particularly troubling. If the State has a problem with judicial\n       impartiality, it is largely one the State brought upon itself by continuing the\n       practice of popularly electing judges.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 792, 122 S. Ct. at 2544 (O’Connor, J., concurring).\n\n¶118 Perhaps most telling are the remarks of Justice Kennedy—who, as noted, authored\n\nthe majority opinion in Citizens United. Justice Kennedy agreed that “[j]udicial integrity\n\nis . . . a state interest of the highest order.” White, 536 U.S. at 793, 122 S. Ct. at 2544\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring). He also acknowledged that a state may choose to have an\n\nelected judiciary, may strive to define those characteristics that exemplify judicial\n\nexcellence, may enshrine its definitions in a code of judicial conduct, may adopt recusal\n\n\n\n\n                                         70\n\fstandards more rigorous than due process requires, and may censure judges who violate\n\nthese standards. White, 536 U.S. at 794, 122 S. Ct. at 2545.\n\n       What [a state] may not do, however, is censor what the people hear as they\n       undertake to decide for themselves which candidate is most likely to be an\n       exemplary judicial officer. Deciding the relevance of candidate speech is\n       the right of the voters, not the State. The law in question here contradicts\n       the principle that unabridged speech is the foundation of political freedom.\n              The State of Minnesota no doubt was concerned, as many citizens\n       and thoughtful commentators are concerned, that judicial campaigns in an\n       age of frenetic fundraising and mass media may foster disrespect for the\n       legal system. Indeed, from the beginning there have been those who\n       believed that the rough-and-tumble of politics would bring our\n       governmental institutions into ill repute. And some have sought to cure this\n       tendency with governmental restrictions on political speech. See Sedition\n       Act of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596. Cooler heads have always recognized,\n       however, that these measures abridge the freedom of speech—not because\n       the state interest is insufficiently compelling, but simply because\n       content-based restrictions on political speech are expressly and positively\n       forbidden by the First Amendment. The State cannot opt for an elected\n       judiciary and then assert that its democracy, in order to work as desired,\n       compels the abridgment of speech.\n\nWhite, 536 U.S. at 794-95, 122 S. Ct. at 2545 (emphases added, internal quotation marks\n\nand some citations omitted).\n\n¶119 The principle espoused by Justice Kennedy in White—that a state may not “censor\n\nwhat the people hear as they undertake to decide for themselves which candidate is most\n\nlikely to be an exemplary judicial officer”—is consistent with the theme of the Citizens\n\nUnited opinion: “[I]t is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the\n\ngoverning rule,” 130 S. Ct. at 911, and “[n]o sufficient governmental interest justifies\n\nlimits on the political speech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations,” 130 S. Ct. at 913. A\n\nfair reading of the broad holding in Citizens United, together with a fair reading of the\n\nFirst Amendment principles articulated in White, leads inevitably to the conclusion that\n\n                                         71\n\fcorporate independent expenditures can no more be prohibited in judicial elections than\n\nthey can be in legislative and executive elections.\n\n                                       E. Summary\n\n¶120 In sum, what has happened here is essentially this: The Supreme Court in Citizens\n\nUnited (and in White) rejected several asserted governmental interests; and this Court has\n\nnow come along, retrieved those interests from the garbage can, dusted them off, slapped\n\na “Made in Montana” sticker on them, and held them up as grounds for sustaining a\n\npatently unconstitutional state statute. The erroneous premise underlying the Court’s\n\nentire approach here is its belief that the Supreme Court rejected the asserted\n\ngovernmental interests only as applied to federal elections. Opinion, ¶¶ 11, 16. Nowhere\n\nin its decision did the Supreme Court state that there was something unique about federal\n\nelections that precluded the PAC-as-an-alternative theory, the antidistortion rationale, or\n\nthe anticorruption interest as justifications for restricting independent expenditures by\n\ncorporations. The Supreme Court simply rejected all of these arguments outright, in\n\nbroad and unqualified language. Not only that, the Supreme Court expressly noted that\n\n“Bellotti did not address the constitutionality of the State’s ban on corporate independent\n\nexpenditures to support candidates. In our view, however, that restriction would have\n\nbeen unconstitutional under Bellotti’s central principle: that the First Amendment does\n\nnot allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s corporate identity.” Citizens\n\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (emphasis added) (citing Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 784-85, 98 S. Ct.\n\nat 1420). This Court is extremely misguided, therefore, in attempting to resurrect the\n\nrejected governmental interests under a “Montana is unique” theory.\n\n                                         72\n\f                                  V. CONCLUSION\n\n¶121 As demonstrated, the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United is clear with\n\nregard to the First Amendment’s protection of corporate political speech.         Section\n\n13-35-227(1), MCA, impermissibly restricts such speech by prohibiting corporations\n\nfrom making “an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that\n\nsupports or opposes a candidate or a political party.” The statute is, therefore, facially\n\nunconstitutional under Citizens United.\n\n¶122 That said, and as noted above, I agree, at least in principle, with the arguments and\n\nconcerns expressed by the Attorney General and the amici curiae supporting the State. I\n\nam deeply frustrated, as are many Americans, with the reach of Citizens United. The\n\nFirst Amendment has now been elevated to a vaunted and isolated position so as to\n\nendow corporations with extravagant rights of political speech and, with those rights, the\n\nexaggerated power to influence voters and elections.\n\n¶123 Professor Howell suggests that “[t]he disconnect between [Citizens United’s and\n\nCaperton’s] statements about corruption” provides Montana an opportunity to preserve\n\nits Corrupt Practices Act as applied to judicial elections. See Larry Howell, Once Upon a\n\nTime in the West: Citizens United, Caperton, and the War of the Copper Kings, at 26\n\n(available at http://mtlr.org). For my own part, I doubt that approach will be successful.\n\nIn its zeal to grant corporations unlimited rights of political speech, the Supreme Court\n\nsummarily dismissed its decision in Caperton with the statement that Caperton “is not to\n\nthe contrary” because its holding “was limited to the rule that the judge must be recused,\n\nnot that the litigant’s political speech could be banned.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n                                          73\n\f910 (emphasis added). This statement, along with the observations of the dissent in\n\nCitizens United and the statements by the majority and concurring opinions in White, lead\n\nme to conclude that Citizens United will eventually be applied to state judicial elections,12\n\nleaving recusals as the sole remedy where corporate expenditures have corrupted or\n\nbiased the judge or judges at issue.13\n\n¶124 Once Citizens United is imposed on elected state judiciaries, I am concerned—as\n\nwere Justices Stevens, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor; as are my former colleagues\n\n(see Amicus Brief of Former Montana Supreme Court Justices William Hunt, William\n\nLeaphart, James Regnier, Terry Trieweiler and John Warner (Apr. 27, 2011)); and as is\n\nthe Court in today’s Opinion—that judicial elections will become little better than the\n\ncorporate bidding wars that elections for partisan offices have already become. I have\n\nsuggested, therefore, that Montana’s voters may—and probably should—amend the\n\nMontana Constitution to implement a merit system for selecting judges. See James C.\n\nNelson, Introduction, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1, 5-6 (2011); cf. W.

Rev. 287 (2011) (suggesting that Montana adopt an\n\nenforceable mechanism for removing Montana justices when potential bias exists).\n\n\n\n\n       12\n           As reflected in the discussion of White (¶¶ 116-118, supra), and as I have\npreviously noted (Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. at 310), the system of electing judges and\njustices presently finds little support or esteem from the appointed federal judiciary.\n        13\n           Perhaps, ironically, it will come to pass that the best way to insure that a judge\nor justice does not sit on a case involving a particular corporation is for the corporation to\nrun a vigorous and expensive campaign supporting the judge’s election.\n                                          74\n\f¶125 While, as a member of this Court, I am bound to follow Citizens United, I do not\n\nhave to agree with the Supreme Court’s decision.14 And, to be absolutely clear, I do not\n\nagree with it. For starters, the notion that corporations are disadvantaged in the political\n\nrealm is unbelievable. Indeed, it has astounded most Americans. The truth is that\n\ncorporations wield inordinate power in Congress and in state legislatures. It is hard to tell\n\nwhere government ends and corporate America begins; the transition is seamless and\n\noverlapping. In my view, Citizens United has turned the First Amendment’s “open\n\nmarketplace” of ideas into an auction house for Friedmanian15 corporatists. Freedom of\n\nspeech is now synonymous with freedom to spend. Speech equals money; money equals\n\ndemocracy. This decidedly was not the view of the constitutional founders, who favored\n\nthe preeminence of individual interests over those of big business. Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 949-50 (dissenting opinion).\n\n¶126 Second, I disagree with the premise that unlimited corporate political speech is\n\nessential to “enlightened self-government” and aids the electorate in making “informed\n\nchoices.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898, 907. I agree that “[r]hetoric ought not\n\nobscure reality.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 907. But I cannot agree that the Citizens\n\n\n       14\n           Cf. J. Harvie Wilkinson III, Of Guns, Abortions, and the Unraveling Rule of\nLaw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 253, 255-56 (2009) (“It is the solemn duty of judges on the inferior\nfederal courts to follow, both in letter and in spirit, rules and decisions with which we\nmay not agree. Our oath demands it, and our respect for the Supreme Court as an\ninstitution and for the able and dedicated individuals who serve on it requires no less.\nBut esteem can likewise be manifest in the respectful expression of difference—that too\nis the essence of the judicial craft.”).\n        15\n           Milton Friedman: the guru, popularizer, and propagandist for unrestrained\nfree-market economics. See Naomi Klein, Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster\nCapitalism (Henry Holt & Co. 2007).\n                                         75\n\fUnited majority’s views reflect “reality.” For one thing, voters generally do not have the\n\ndesire, much less the time, sophistication, or ability, to sift through hours upon hours of\n\nattack ads, political mumbo jumbo, and sound bites in order to winnow truth (of which\n\nthere often seems to be very little) from fiction and half-truths (of which there\n\nunfortunately seems to be an endless supply).16 The Supreme Court believes the solution\n\nfor false or misleading speech is more speech. Yet, an endless barrage of accusations and\n\ncounteraccusations providing more fodder than fact only serves to overwhelm, confuse,\n\nand disenchant voters.\n\n¶127 Furthermore, it defies reality to suggest that millions of dollars in slick television\n\nand Internet ads—put out by entities whose purpose and expertise, in the first place, is to\n\npersuade people to buy what’s being sold—carry the same weight as the fliers of citizen\n\ncandidates and the letters to the editor of John and Mary Public. It is utter nonsense to\n\nthink that ordinary citizens or candidates can spend enough to place their experience,\n\nwisdom, and views before the voters and keep pace with the virtually unlimited spending\n\ncapability of corporations to place corporate views before the electorate. In spending\n\nability, bigger really is better; and with campaign advertising and attack ads, quantity\n\ncounts. In the end, candidates and the public will become mere bystanders in elections.\n\n\n\n       16\n         For example, the Los Angeles Times recently reported that Crossroads GPS, the\nconservative group co-founded by Karl Rove, released an ad slamming Montana Senator\nJon Tester for supporting an Environmental Protection Agency regulation on farm dust.\nHowever, one Montana cable show pulled the ad “because the network determined that it\nwas false; the regulation was actually never proposed, and the vote cited in the ad was a\nprocedural measure.” Tom Hamburger & Melanie Mason, Chamber of Commerce\nGetting Early Start with Attack Ads, L.A. Times (Nov. 16, 2011).\n                                        76\n\f¶128 Third, with respect to the interests of shareholders in not being compelled to fund\n\ncorporate political speech with which they disagree, I do not believe that participation in\n\n“corporate democracy” actually accounts for anything—unless, of course, the objecting\n\nshareholder is an insider or owns a controlling percentage of the outstanding stock. I\n\ncannot agree that “corporate democracy” will cause big business and multinational\n\ncorporations to exercise responsibly their new unlimited power to speak and spend. It\n\nwon’t, because money, influence, and access are at stake. Any notion to the contrary is\n\nsimply the triumph of hope over experience.\n\n¶129 Fourth, I absolutely do not agree that corporate money in the form of “independent\n\nexpenditures” expressly advocating the election or defeat of candidates cannot give rise\n\nto corruption or the appearance of corruption. Of course it can. Even the most cursory\n\nreview of decades of partisan campaigns and elections, whether state or federal,\n\ndemonstrates this. Citizens United held that the only sufficiently important governmental\n\ninterest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption is one that is limited to\n\nquid pro quo corruption. This is simply smoke and mirrors. See Citizens United, 130\n\nS. Ct. at 961 (dissenting opinion). In the real world of politics, the “quid pro quo” of\n\nboth direct contributions to candidates and independent expenditures on their behalf is\n\nloyalty. And, in practical effect, experience teaches that money corrupts, and enough of it\n\ncorrupts absolutely. See e.g. Caperton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n¶130 Fifth, therefore, I cannot agree with the holding that the prevention of corruption\n\nin the form of independent expenditures is not a compelling state interest. There is no\n\nplausible reason why a state would not want to protect the integrity of its election process\n\n                                         77\n\fagainst corruption and undue influence; to do otherwise would render the fundamental\n\nright to vote a meaningless exercise. To my knowledge, the First Amendment has never\n\nbeen interpreted to be absolute and gloriously isolated from other fundamental rights and\n\nvalues protected by the Constitution. Yet, Citizens United distorts the right to speech\n\nbeyond recognition. Indeed, I am shocked that the Supreme Court did not balance the\n\nright to speech with the government’s compelling interest in preserving the fundamental\n\nright to vote in elections.\n\n¶131 At the same time, though, I am not persuaded that Montana’s experience with\n\ncorruption is as “unique” as the Attorney General and this Court posit. Each state has its\n\nown corruption horror stories and has battled political and election corruption at one time\n\nor another. Even a casual examination of the daily newspaper or the evening news\n\nproves that battling political corruption is ongoing; like painting the Golden Gate Bridge,\n\nwhen you reach one end, you start over at the other. It should be noted that Montana’s\n\nCorrupt Practices Act was adopted in 1912 at a time when the country’s focus was on\n\npreventing political corruption, not on protecting corporate influence. Due to intervening\n\nchanges in the composition and philosophy of the Supreme Court, that focus has now\n\nflip-flopped. See Zephyr Teachout, The Historical Roots of Citizens United v. FEC:\n\nHow Anarchists and Academics Accidentally Created Corporate Speech Rights, 5 Harv.\n\nL. & Policy Rev. 163 (2011).         Montana’s Corrupt Practices Act has become an\n\nhistorical—and unconstitutional—artifact, and it will have to be legislatively revised to\n\naccommodate a changed time and a changed Supreme Court. A number of our sister\n\n\n\n                                        78\n\fstates have modified their laws in the wake of Citizens United (see ¶ 72 n. 4, supra), and I\n\nexpect that Montana’s 2013 Legislature will, or should, be tasked with doing the same.\n\n¶132 Lastly, I am compelled to say something about corporate “personhood.” While I\n\nrecognize that this doctrine is firmly entrenched in the law, see Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 780\n\nn. 15, 98 S. Ct. at 1418 n. 15; but see 435 U.S. at 822, 98 S. Ct. at 1439-40 (Rehnquist, J.,\n\ndissenting), I find the entire concept offensive. Corporations are artificial creatures of\n\nlaw.   As such, they should enjoy only those powers—not constitutional rights, but\n\nlegislatively-conferred powers—that are concomitant with their legitimate function, that\n\nbeing limited-liability investment vehicles for business. Corporations are not persons.\n\nHuman beings are persons, and it is an affront to the inviolable dignity of our species that\n\ncourts have created a legal fiction which forces people—human beings—to share\n\nfundamental, natural rights with soulless creations of government. Worse still, while\n\ncorporations and human beings share many of the same rights under the law, they clearly\n\nare not bound equally to the same codes of good conduct, decency, and morality, and\n\nthey are not held equally accountable for their sins. Indeed, it is truly ironic that the\n\ndeath penalty and hell are reserved only to natural persons.\n\n¶133 Having said all this, I must return to the central point of this Dissent. Regardless\n\nof my disagreement with the views of the Citizens United majority, the fact remains that\n\nthe Supreme Court has spoken. It has interpreted the protections of the First Amendment\n\nvis-à-vis corporate political speech. Agree with its decision or not, Montana’s judiciary\n\nand elected officers are bound to accept and enforce the Supreme Court’s ruling—in the\n\nsame way that this Court demands obedience to its rulings, like them or not.\n\n                                         79\n\f¶134 For these reasons, I dissent from the Court’s analysis in the instant case. I\n\ndisagree with the Court’s decision to parse Citizens United in a fashion so as to “send a\n\nmessage” to, or be the next “test case” before, the Supreme Court. In my view, this\n\napproach is disingenuous. Montana is in the same First Amendment swimming pool as\n\nevery other state, and the Supreme Court has dictated that its waters are expansive and\n\ndeep when it comes to corporate political speech. Citizens United is the law of the land,\n\nand this Court is duty-bound to follow it. When this case is appealed to the Supreme\n\nCourt, as I expect it will be, a summary reversal on the merits (see U.S. Sup. Ct. R. 16)\n\nwould not surprise me in the least.\n\n¶135 In my opinion, District Court Judge Sherlock’s well-reasoned and courageous—\n\nthough politically unpopular—decision should be affirmed. I cannot agree with this\n\nCourt’s determination not to do so. Therefore, I respectfully and regretfully dissent.\n\n\n                                                 /S/ JAMES C.
