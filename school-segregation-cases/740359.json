As a result of the Property Managers‟ conduct,\nBolmer claims his apartment complex fell into disrepair,\ndefects and violations were no longer fixed, common areas\nwere rarely cleaned, and criminal activity went unreported.\nThus, he says he suffered injury to his leasehold property.\nThe District Court granted the Property Managers‟ Motion to\nDismiss, holding that Bolmer failed to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted, and he now appeals. For the\nreasons that follow, we will affirm.\n\n                             I.\n\n                             A.\n\n       Mr. Bolmer has resided in the Pingry Arms building in\nPlainfield, New Jersey since February 2004. At some point\nafter he moved in, the apartment building came under the\nmanagement of Connolly Properties.1 Bolmer alleges that,\n\n1\n  The date when this change in management occurred is not\nrevealed in the record.\n\n\n\n\n                             4\n\fafter Connolly Properties began managing his building, the\napartment complex fell into disrepair. Specifically, he claims\nthat Connolly Properties provided inadequate heat; failed to\nrepair locks, his air conditioner, and the roof; failed to\nregularly clean common areas; allowed the building to\nbecome infested with bugs and rodents; permitted\novercrowding, flooding, and mold; and turned a blind eye to\ncriminal activity on the premises.\n\n        Bolmer asserts that, no later than January 2006, the\nProperty Managers developed a scheme wherein they actively\nsought out aliens lacking lawful immigration status as\nprospective tenants. They did so, he says, by hiring a\nSpanish-speaking leasing agent and directing her to handwrite\nflyers in Spanish to advertise vacancies. Bolmer claims that\nthe Property Managers told the leasing agent to ask all\nSpanish-speaking prospective tenants whether they were in\nthis country lawfully and to exempt any aliens not lawfully\npresent from the normal requirements of presenting\nidentification and submitting to commercial background\nscreenings. According to Bolmer, the Property Managers\nspecifically sought out these individuals as tenants because\nthey believed that they were less likely to complain about\npoor housing conditions or to report housing code violations\nto the authorities. He maintains that, by renting a substantial\nnumber of apartments to aliens not lawfully present, the\nProperty Managers were able to allow their buildings to\ndeteriorate into “slum-like conditions” without offering their\ntenants any reduction in rent. Bolmer further asserts that the\nProperty Managers segregated those tenants whom they\nbelieved to lack lawful immigration status into particular\nbuildings “to avoid their detection by law enforcement and\nother officials.” Appellant‟s Br. 16. He maintains that the\n\n\n\n\n                              5\n\fProperty Managers “acted on a belief that „mixing‟ a largely\nHispanic illegal alien tenant population among African-\nAmerican citizen tenants would provoke disturbances and\nfights caused by animus between citizens and illegal aliens,\nand result in entry by law enforcement officer [sic] onto the\npremises to conduct investigations and arrests.” Id. at 17.\n\n                                   B.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed this suit in June 2008 and subsequently\namended their complaint twice, filing their Second Amended\nComplaint in December 2008. In Count I, Bolmer alleged\nthat the Property Managers violated the conspiracy provision\nof the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). Specifically, he claimed that\nthe Property Managers entered into a conspiracy to engage in\nan “Illegal Alien Rental Scheme” by renting apartments to\naliens not lawfully present under the theory that they were\nless likely to complain about their housing conditions (or to\ndemand a rent reduction in light of those conditions). The\nalleged result of this conspiracy was to deny Bolmer and\nother lawful tenants the full value of their leasehold by\nenabling the Property Managers to keep the apartment\ncomplex in poor condition without reducing rents.\n\n       The Property Managers filed a Motion to Dismiss\nCount I under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The\nDistrict Court granted their motion, dismissing Count I with\nprejudice and denying Bolmer‟s Motion for Leave to File a\nThird Amended Complaint. The District Court held that\nBolmer failed to allege the predicate act of harboring and that\nhe therefore failed to state a RICO conspiracy claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. Bolmer filed a Motion for\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fReconsideration, which the District Court denied. Bolmer\nthen filed a motion for partial final judgment on the District\nCourt‟s April and September Orders, pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 54(b), which the Court granted.\n\n       Bolmer now appeals the District Court‟s decision.2\n\n                                   II.\n\n        We exercise plenary review over the District Court‟s\ngrant of defendants‟ motion to dismiss. Warren Gen. Hosp.\nv. Amgen, Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 83 (3d Cir. 2011). “In reviewing\na dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),\n„we accept all factual allegations as true [and] construe the\ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.‟” Id. at\n84 (quoting Pinker v. Roche Holdings, Ltd., 292 F.3d 361,\n374 n.7 (3d Cir. 2002)). A motion to dismiss pursuant to\n12(b)(6) may be granted “only if, accepting all well-pleaded\nallegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, a court finds that\nplaintiff‟s claims lack facial plausibility.” Id. (citing Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007)).\nThough a complaint “does not need detailed factual\nallegations, . . . a formulaic recitation of the elements of a\ncause of action will not do.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\n        On appeal, Bolmer argues that the District Court erred\nin finding that he failed to allege a pattern of racketeering\nactivity. Bolmer argues that he adequately pled two RICO\n\n2\n The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1331. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1291.\n\n\n\n\n                               7\n\fpredicate acts. First, he asserts that the Property Managers\nviolated 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii), which prohibits a\nperson from “conceal[ing], harbor[ing], or shield[ing] from\ndetection, or attempt[ing] to conceal, harbor, or shield from\ndetection” an alien who has illegally entered or remained in\nthe United States, “in any place, including any building or\nany means of transportation.” Second, Bolmer asserts that\nthe Property Managers violated 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv),\nwhich prohibits a person from “encourag[ing] or induc[ing]\nan alien to . . . reside in the United States, knowing or in\nreckless disregard of the fact that such . . . residence is or will\nbe in violation of law.” We address each of these arguments\nin turn.\n\n                                A.\n\n      Under 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iii) a person is\ncriminally liable if she,\n\n       knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that\n       an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the\n       United States in violation of law, conceals,\n       harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts\n       to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection,\n       such alien in any place, including any building\n       or means of transportation.\n\nWe first addressed the question of what conduct constitutes\nthe crime of harboring in United States v. Ozcelik, 527 F.3d\n88 (3d Cir. 2008). In that case, Hakan Ozcelik was charged\nwith harboring after he gave general advice to “stay low” to\nan individual whom he knew to be in the United States\nillegally. Ozcelik, 527 F.3d at 97. We reversed Ozcelik‟s\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\fharboring conviction, holding that “the terms „shielding,‟\n„harboring,‟ and „concealing‟ under § 1324 encompass\nconduct „tending to substantially facilitate an alien‟s\nremaining in the United States illegally‟ and to prevent\ngovernment authorities from detecting the alien‟s unlawful\npresence.” Id. (quoting United States v. Rubino-Gonzalez,\n674 F.2d 1067, 1073 (5th Cir. 1982)). We added that\n“[h]olding Ozcelik criminally responsible for passing along\ngeneral information to an illegal alien would effectively write\nthe word „substantially‟ out of the test we have undertaken to\napply.” Id. at 101.\n\n       We have since reaffirmed our commitment to the test\nlaid out in Ozcelik. See United States v. Cuevas-Reyes, 572\nF.3d 119 (3d Cir. 2009); United States v. Silveus, 542 F.3d\n993, 1003 (3d Cir. 2008) (noting that “cohabitation with [an\nalien lacking lawful immigration status], taken alone, does\nnot constitute „harboring‟ within the meaning of the statute”).\nMoreover, in Lozano v. City of Hazleton, we specifically\nnoted that\n\n       “harboring” requires some act of obstruction\n       that reduces the likelihood the government will\n       discover the alien‟s presence. It is highly\n       unlikely that a landlord’s renting of an\n       apartment to an alien lacking lawful\n       immigration status could ever, without more,\n       satisfy this definition of harboring. Renting an\n       apartment in the normal course of business is\n       not in and of itself conduct that prevents the\n       government from detecting an alien‟s presence.\n\n\n\n\n                              9\n\fLozano v. City of Hazleton, 620 F.3d 170, 223 (3d Cir. 2010),\nvacated on other grounds, City of Hazleton v. Lozano, 180 L.\nEd. 2d 243 (2011) (emphasis added).3\n\nThus, to the extent that they simply rented apartments to\naliens not lawfully present, the Property Managers cannot be\nsaid to have committed the crime of harboring.\n\n        Bolmer argues that the the Property Managers did\n“much more than merely rent[]” apartments to undocumented\nindividuals in that they “set up a criminal scheme which (1)\nspecifically targeted illegal aliens as prospective tenants . . .\nand (2) which steered illegal aliens into certain properties for\nthe express purpose of preventing authorities from detecting\nthe presence of illegal aliens on their properties.” Appellant‟s\nBr. 8. In support of his claim that this conduct constitutes\nharboring, Bolmer directs our attention to cases from our\nsister circuits that have found harboring violations. Indeed,\nother circuits (some of which have defined “harboring” more\nbroadly than we have in Ozcelik and other cases) have found\ndefendants to be guilty of harboring in a variety of situations.\n\n3\n   While the Supreme Court recently vacated Lozano and\nremanded it to this Court for further consideration in light of\nits opinion in Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting, 131 S. Ct.\n1968 (2011), Lozano‟s reasoning regarding harboring still\nprovides us with useful direction. Whiting dealt with the\nquestion of whether federal law preempts an Arizona state\nlaw that authorized the state to impose licensing sanctions on\nemployers that hire undocumented individuals. 2011 U.S.\nLEXIS at *12. Whiting did not address the question of what\nconduct constitutes harboring, nor did it disturb this Court‟s\nreasoning on that point.\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fSee, e.g., Edwards v. Prime Inc., 602 F.3d 1276 (11th Cir.\n2010) (holding that defendants engaged in harboring where\nthey knowingly employed undocumented individuals,\nprovided them with false names and Social Security numbers,\nand paid them in cash); United States v. Xiang Hui Ye, 588\nF.3d 411 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that defendant was guilty of\nharboring where he employed individuals he knew were\nundocumented, did not require them to fill out job\napplications, tax forms, or other employment documents,\nleased apartments for them, paid them in cash, advised them\nthat they could purchase fake immigration documents in\nChicago, and omitted them from state employment forms);\nUnited States v. Singh, 261 F.3d 530 (5th Cir. 2001) (noting\nthat defendant may have been guilty of harboring where he\nemployed undocumented individuals in his convenience store\nand those individuals lived in a back room of the store);\nUnited States v. Sanchez, 927 F.2d 376, 379 (8th Cir. 1991)\n(holding that defendant was guilty of harboring where she and\nher husband “met with illegal aliens; the aliens told Mr.\nSanchez that they were illegal; Mr. Sanchez told the illegal\naliens that he could provide immigration papers for them; Mr.\nSanchez paid to rent an apartment for the illegal aliens; Mrs.\nSanchez took the illegal aliens to an apartment paid for by\nMr. Sanchez; and Mrs. Sanchez told an illegal alien that she\nwould give him a paper that would permit him to work”).\n\n       These cases, however, all involved defendants who\nfailed to make necessary state and federal employment-\nrelated disclosures, were involved in smuggling\nundocumented individuals into this country, attempted to\nwarn undocumented individuals of the presence of law\nenforcement authorities, and/or provided specific assistance\nin obtaining false documents. Here, the Property Managers\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\fwere not required to disclose their tenants‟ identities or\nimmigration status to federal or state authorities, nor did they\nbring their tenants into this country, offer them assistance in\nprocuring false documents, impede a law enforcement\ninvestigation, or pay to rent apartments on their behalf so as\nto keep their names off of the leases. We do not know of any\ncourt of appeals that has held that knowingly renting an\napartment to an alien lacking lawful immigration status\nconstitutes harboring. Indeed, we believe that such a holding\nwould be contrary to our prior opinion in Ozcelik, because\nsuch conduct does not constitute the type of “substantial\nfacilitation” that we require to make out a harboring offense.\n\n        Moreover, even assuming we were to find that the\nProperty Managers substantially facilitated such aliens\nremaining in the United States, the Ozcelik test also requires\nBolmer to show that their conduct tended to “prevent\ngovernment authorities from detecting the alien‟s unlawful\npresence.” Ozcelik, 527 F.3d at 100. He has not alleged facts\nthat show such conduct. The two specific acts that Bolmer\nsuggests constituted “acts of obstruction” were 1) exempting\naliens not lawfully present from background checks and 2)\nsegregating them into specific rental buildings. However,\nthese actions did not actually hinder immigration authorities‟\ndetection of undocumented tenants. First, landlords have no\nobligation to require background checks of their tenants, so\nthe Property Managers did not evade any federal or state\nreporting requirements. Moreover, Bolmer did not allege that\nthird party background check screeners could or would have\ndetermined rental applicants‟ immigration status or that they\nwould have passed such status information along to\nimmigration authorities. Second, by grouping large numbers\nof undocumented individuals into specific apartment\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fbuildings, the Property Managers arguably made the\nundocumented population more conspicuous, both to Bolmer\nand to the authorities. Bolmer noted that, “[b]efore CPI\nbegan managing the Pingry Arms property, mostly African-\nAmerican and Caucasian tenants resided at the property.\nDuring CPI‟s management of Pingry Arms, [he] . . . observed\nthe evolution of the tenants to majority Hispanic, and few\nspeak English [sic].” Pl.‟s SAC ¶¶ 70-71. He describes his\nbuilding today as an “illegal alien slum,” id. ¶ 73, and it is\nclear that he found his allegedly undocumented alien\nneighbors to be more visible as they increased in number.\n\n       While Bolmer has plausibly asserted that the Property\nManagers sought to conceal their own violations of local\nhousing code and of federal prohibitions against\ndiscrimination in housing, he has not shown that they did\nanything to prevent their undocumented residents from being\napprehended by immigration authorities. Certainly, as in\nOzcelik, the Property Managers were likely aware that some\nof their residents lacked lawful immigration status and did\nnothing to alert federal authorities to this fact. The picture\nBolmer paints, however, is one of a company whose\nleadership cared little of what happened to its tenants so long\nas Connolly Properties received a steady stream of rental\nincome from any source. Bolmer has alleged that the\nProperty Managers engaged in a great deal of unsavory and\npossibly discriminatory behavior. However, he has not\nsufficiently alleged that their conduct “„tend[ed] to\nsubstantially facilitate an alien‟s remaining in the United\nStates illegally‟ and to prevent government authorities from\ndetecting the alien‟s unlawful presence.” Ozcelik, 527 F.3d at\n100. Thus, the District Court properly dismissed his\nharboring claim.\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f                                   B.\n\n       Bolmer also asserts that the Property Managers\nviolated 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv), which penalizes a\nperson who “encourages or induces an alien to come to, enter,\nor reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless\ndisregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence\nis or will be in violation of law.” As described above, in\norder to make out a claim for harboring in our circuit, it must\nbe shown that the alleged violator “substantially facilitated”\nan alien not lawfully present remaining in the United States.\nSimilarly, we believe that encouragement or inducement must\nalso be “substantial” to support a conviction under the statute.\nThis means not just general advice (as the Ozcelik defendant\nprovided) but some affirmative assistance that makes an alien\nlacking lawful immigration status more likely to enter or\nremain in the United States than she otherwise might have\nbeen. “Induce” is defined as “to move by persuasion or\ninfluence; to call forth or bring about by influence or\nstimulation; to cause the formation of; or to produce,”\nMERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY, available at\nwww.merriam-webster.com, and that word plainly refers to\nconduct that causes someone to do something that they might\notherwise not do. Moreover, “[t]he ordinary and common\nsense meaning of „encourage‟ implies an affirmative act that\nserves as a catalyst or trigger that drives, motivates, or spurs\nanother individual to embark on a course of action that he\nmight not have otherwise.” United States v. Lopez, 590 F.3d\n1238, 1259 (11th Cir. 2009) (Barkett, J., dissenting). Thus,\n“encourage” is best defined as “„[t]o instigate; to incite to\naction; to give courage to; to inspirit; to embolden; to raise\nconfidence; to make confident.‟” Id. (quoting BLACK‟S LAW\nDICTIONARY 620 (4th ed. 1968)).              These definitions\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\fdemonstrate that the word “encourage,” in the context of this\nstatute, also refers to conduct that causes someone to do\nsomething that they otherwise might not do.\n\n        Indeed, reading the encouraging or inducing\nsubsection of the statute too broadly risks rendering the\nremaining subsections of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A) redundant\nor superfluous. Subsection (i) prohibits bringing an alien\nlacking lawful immigration status to the United States other\nthan at a designated port of entry. Subsection (ii) prohibits\ntransporting such an alien within the United States in\nfurtherance of their illegal presence in this country. Finally,\nsubsection (iii), which we have already discussed at length,\nprohibits harboring an alien not lawfully present. If we define\n“encourage” merely as “to help,” then the particular conduct\nthat is prohibited in subsections (i)-(iii) is subsumed by the\ngeneral prohibition against helping an undocumented person\nto “come to, enter, or reside in” the United States in\nsubsection (iv). “It is a well known canon of statutory\nconstruction that courts should construe statutory language to\navoid interpretations that would render any phrase\nsuperfluous.” United States v. Cooper, 396 F.3d 308, 312 (3d\nCir. 2005); see also Lopez, 590 F.3d at 1259 (“„A basic\npremise of statutory construction is that a statute is to be\ninterpreted so that no words shall be discarded as being\nmeaningless, redundant, or mere surplusage.‟” (quoting\nUnited States v. Canals-Jimenez, 943 F.2d 1284, 1287 (11th\nCir. 1991))). Accordingly, we read subsection (iv) as\nprohibiting a person from engaging in an affirmative act that\nsubstantially encourages or induces an alien lacking lawful\nimmigration status to come to, enter, or reside in the United\nStates where the undocumented person otherwise might not\nhave done so. Thus, subsection (iv) has the distinct character\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\fof foreclosing the type of substantial assistance that will spur\na person to commit a violation of immigration law where they\notherwise might not have.\n\n        The Property Managers in this case did not engage in\nan affirmative act that served as a catalyst for aliens to reside\nin the United States in violation of immigration law when\nthey might not have otherwise. Bolmer suggests that the\nProperty Managers provided aliens not lawfully present with\nrental housing, which other companies would not do, thereby\nencouraging them to reside in the United States when they\notherwise might not have. However, Bolmer did not allege\nthat these aliens would not or could not have resided in the\nUnited States without renting apartments in Connolly\nProperties‟ buildings. Nor, given the facts of this case, would\nsuch an assertion have been facially plausible, as the motion\nto dismiss standard requires. See Warren Hosp. v. Amgen,\nInc., 643 F.3d 77, 83 (3d Cir. 2011). Among other things,\nmany aliens are eligible for federal public housing benefits\neven if they live in households in which some members are\naliens not lawfully present. See ALISON SISKIN & MAGGIE\nMCCARTY,         CONGRESSIONAL         RESEARCH        SERVICE,\nIMMIGRATION: NONCITIZEN ELIGIBILITY FOR NEEDS-BASED\nHOUSING PROGRAMS (2008). This suggests that aliens\nlacking lawful immigration status are able to reside in this\ncountry with or without the assistance of the Property\nManagers‟ alleged rental scheme. Moreover, there is no legal\nrequirement that apartment managers screen potential tenants\nbased on immigration status, and in some places it is actually\nillegal to do so. See Note, “There Be No Shelter Here”: Anti-\nImmigrant Housing Ordinances and Comprehensive Reform,\n20 CORNELL J. L. & PUB. POL‟Y 399, (2010) (“California, for\nexample [has] enact[ed] legislation barring landlords from\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\fasking tenants their legal status . . . . New York City also has\nan ordinance prohibiting landlords from questioning tenants\nabout their legal status or discriminating against them based\non alienage or citizenship.”). Thus, Bolmer cannot show that\nthe Property Managers‟ conduct incited aliens to remain in\nthis country unlawfully when they otherwise might not have\ndone so, and he therefore has not alleged that they engaged in\nconduct sufficient to constitute encouraging or inducing.\n\n        We recognize that some of our sister circuits have\nchosen to define “encouraging or inducing” more broadly\nthan we do here. See Edwards, 602 F.3d at 1295 (affirming a\nconviction for encouraging or inducing where the defendants\nhired and actively sought out individuals known to be\nundocumented and also provided them with names and social\nsecurity numbers to facilitate their illegal employment);\nLopez, 590 F.3d at 1249-52 (defining “encouraging or\ninducing” to include the act of “helping” aliens come to,\nenter, or remain in the United States and upholding Lopez‟s\nconviction for encouraging or inducing where he captained a\nboat to the Bahamas, refueled it, spent the night, picked up\naliens who lacked lawful immigration status from a hotel, and\nthen drove them toward the United States in the boat); United\nStates v. Fujii, 301 F.3d 535, 540 (7th Cir. 2002) (“To prove\nthat Fujii „encouraged or induced‟ the aliens, all that the\ngovernment needed to establish was that Fujii knowingly\nhelped or advised the aliens.”). Nevertheless, while setting a\nseemingly low bar (i.e. “to help”) these cases have found that\nencouraging or inducing occurred only where defendants\nwere personally involved in bringing aliens lacking lawful\nimmigration status into the United States. The defendant in\nFujii, for example, accompanied such aliens on their trip to\nthe United States, while the Lopez defendant conveyed aliens\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\ftoward the Untied States via boat. Thus, we are not\nconvinced that these circuits would agree that giving any type\nof “help” to an alien not lawfully present, no matter how de\nminimis the assistance, constitutes the crime of encouraging\nor inducing.\n\n        Moreover, defining the conduct at issue in this case as\nencouraging or inducing runs the risk of criminalizing actions\ncontemplated by federal law and undermining the federal\nsystem of immigration enforcement. Persons who currently\nlack lawful immigration status may nonetheless reside in the\nUnited States, often with the explicit knowledge or even\npermission of the federal government. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §\n1158 (authorizing the grant of asylum to refugees who are\nfleeing persecution abroad); 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (allowing\naliens to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident); 8\nU.S.C. § 1229b(b) (providing relief from deportation to\ncertain persons otherwise subject to removal); 8 C.F.R. §\n244.2 (granting certain aliens temporary protected status); 8\nC.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(8)-(11), (14) (defining categories of\naliens lacking lawful immigration status who are eligible to\nreceive an employment authorization document). We cannot\nimagine that Congress contemplated that our nation‟s\nlandlords (not to mention our hotel and motel operators,\ninnkeepers, and others who are in the business of providing\naccommodations) would be tasked with making complex\nlegal determinations about who is permitted to live in this\ncountry, much less that they would be criminalized for an\nerror in so doing. Thus, we believe that our interpretation of\nthe encouraging and inducing statute best comports with the\nlarger scheme of federal immigration law.\n\n                             III.\n\n\n\n\n                              18\n\f       Bolmer also argues that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion by refusing to allow him to amend his complaint\nfor a third time in order to plead additional facts that would\ndemonstrate that the Property Managers prevented their\nundocumented residents from being detected by law\nenforcement. He relies on Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229 (3d\nCir. 2004), for the proposition that, “even when a plaintiff\ndoes not expressly seek leave to amend, „if a claim is\nvulnerable to a 12(b)(6) dismissal, the court must give the\nparty an opportunity to amend its pleadings unless such\namendment would be futile or the party has expressed his\nintent to stand on his pleadings.‟” Appellant‟s Br. 48\n(quoting Alston, 363 F.3d at 236). Alston, however, was\ngiven no opportunity whatsoever to amend his complaint,\nwhile Bolmer amended his complaint twice. Alston, 363 F.3d\nat 234 n.7. Moreover, Alston‟s was a civil rights complaint.\n“In non-civil rights cases, the settled rule is that properly\nrequesting leave to amend a complaint requires submitting a\ndraft amended complaint.” Fletcher-Harlee Corp. v. Pote\nConcrete Contrs., Inc., 482 F.3d 247, 252-53 (3d Cir. 2007).\nBolmer never presented a draft of a third amended complaint\nto the District Court. This failure is fatal to his request.\n\n        Bolmer argues that he did inform the District Court of\nadditional facts that he wished to allege. Although a district\ncourt is authorized to grant a plaintiff leave to amend a\ncomplaint when justice so requires, it is not compelled to do\nso when amendment would be futile. Shane v. Fauver, 213\nF.3d 113, 115 (3d Cir. 2000). Here, the District Court found\nthat further amendment of the complaint would have been\nfutile. Our independent review of the record confirms that the\n\n\n\n\n                             19\n\fDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bolmer\nleave to amend his complaint a third time.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District\nCourt=s dismissal of Bolmer‟s claim.4\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Because it found that Bolmer did not allege facts sufficient\nto constitute the predicate acts of harboring or encouraging or\ninducing, the District Court did not reach the issue of whether\nBolmer had standing to bring a RICO claim. Bolmer v.\nConnolly Properties, Inc., No. 08-2753, slip op. at 6 n.2\n(D.N.J. April 8, 2009). For the same reason, we also decline\nto address this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                              20\n\fMcKee, Chief Judge, concurring.\n\n       Although I join my colleagues‘ analysis in its entirety,\n\nI write separately to highlight problems inherent in the text of\n\nthe Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act\n\n(―RICO‖) that are exemplified by this complaint.            My\n\nconcern arises from the fact that the treble damage provision\n\nof RICO spawns claims that are not at all related to the\n\ncongressional purpose underlying that statute.        Although\n\nmany have recognized this problem, Congress has yet to\n\naddress it. I nevertheless remain hopeful that continued calls\n\nfor a legislative response to problems endemic in RICO‘s\n\ncivil damage provision will one day alert Congress to the\n\nneed to restrict the statute to the ills Congress thought it was\n\naddressing when it enacted this far reaching legislation.\n\n\n       I.\n\n\n       ―RICO was an aggressive initiative to supplement old\n\nremedies and develop new methods for fighting crime.‖\n\nSedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 498 (1985)\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n\n\n  Judges Fuentes and Greenberg join Chief Judge McKee in\nthis concurring opinion.\n                               1\n\f       As is clear from my colleagues‘ explanation of this\n\nAmended Complaint, this case is at once a landlord-tenant\n\ndispute, a nuisance claim, and an alleged conspiracy to\n\nunlawfully rent apartments to undocumented persons. Those\n\nallegations are a far cry from what Congress intended when it\n\nadded certain immigration violations to the already expansive\n\nlist of predicate acts that would support a civil RICO claim.\n\n\n       Bolmer rests his RICO claim solely upon alleged\n\nviolations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (―INA‖).\n\nRICO was amended to define ―racketeering activity‖ to\n\ninclude: ―any act which is indictable under the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, section 274 (relating to bringing in and\n\nharboring certain aliens) . . . .‖    18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(F)\n\n(2006).     Section 274, which is now a RICO predicate\n\noffense, prohibits the bringing in, transportation, harboring, or\n\nemployment of undocumented aliens.           8 U.S.C. § 1324\n\n(2006). ―[A] violation of § 274 of the INA is one of the\n\ninfrequently used ‗racketeering acts‘ identified in RICO §\n\n1961(1).‖ Paul Batista, Civil RICO Practice Manual, § 3.15\n\n(3d ed. Supp. 2010). As my colleagues explain, harboring\n\n\n\n\n                               2\n\fand encouraging or inducing—the alleged predicate acts\n\nhere—are ill-defined under the INA itself.\n\n\n        It is, nevertheless, clear that Congress did extend\n\nRICO‘s predicate offenses to include specified immigration\n\nviolations when it enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective\n\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996 (―AEDPA‖). Pub. L. No. 104-\n\n132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). In fact, § 433 of AEDPA is\n\nentitled: ―Establishing Certain Alien Smuggling-Related\n\nCrimes as RICO-Predicate Offenses.‖              Those ―RICO\n\nAmendments‖ primarily focus on unlawful assistance to\n\nundocumented persons entering the country and those who\n\nhelp them evade law enforcement while here.1\n\n\n\n1\n    See AEDPA § 433.\n\n        Establishing Certain Alien Smuggling-Related Crimes\n        as RICO-Predicate Offenses: Section 1961(1) of title\n        18, United States Code, is amended—\n        (1) by inserting ―section 1028 (relating to fraud and\n        related activity in connection with identification\n        documents) if the act indictable under section 1028\n        was committed for the purpose of financial gain,‖\n        before ―section 1029‖;\n        (2) by inserting ―section 1542 (relating to false\n        statement in application and use of passport) if the act\n        indictable under section 1542 was committed for the\n        purpose of financial gain, section 1543 (relating to\n        forgery or false use of passport) if the act indictable\n        under section 1543 was committed for the purpose of\n                                3\n\f      Congressional concern with smuggling organizations\n\nis evident in the text, history, and purpose of the AEDPA\n\namendments to RICO.      The House Committee Report on\n\nAEDPA explains:\n\n\n             The bill adds a number of immigration-related\n      offenses as predicate offenses under the Racketeer\n      Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (―RICO‖). The\n      RICO statute is among the principal tools that Federal\n      law enforcement officials use to combat organized\n      crime. The amendment made by this section will\n      extend the definition of ―predicate acts‖ to enable them\n      to use the statute to combat alien smuggling\n      organizations.\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 104-22 (1995), 1995 WL 56411 at *6\n\n(emphasis added). Predicate acts established by AEDPA thus\n\n      financial gain, section 1544 (relating to misuse of\n      passport) if the act indictable under section 1544 was\n      committed for the purpose of financial gain, section\n      1546 (relating to fraud and misuse of visas, permits,\n      and other documents) if the act indictable under\n      section 1546 was committed for the purpose of\n      financial gain, sections 1581–1588 (relating to\n      peonage and slavery),‖ after ―section 1513 (relating to\n      retaliating against a witness, victim, or an\n      informant),‖;\n      (3) by striking ―or‖ before ―(E)‖; and\n      (4) by inserting before the period at the end the\n      following: ―, or (F) any act which is indictable under\n      the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 274\n      (relating to bringing in and harboring certain aliens),\n      section 277 (relating to aiding or assisting certain\n      aliens to enter the United States), or section 278\n      (relating to importation of alien for immoral purpose)\n      if the act indictable under such section of such Act was\n      committed for the purpose of financial gain[.]‖.\n                              4\n\freflect Congress‘ desire to include smuggling ―organizations‖\n\nwithin RICO‘s grasp. The amendments focus on the kind of\n\nactivity such organizations engage in to smuggle aliens into\n\nthe country. ―The offenses added as RICO predicate act[s]\n\nare offenses involving fraud, false use, or forgery of\n\npassports, identification documents, or visas; offenses relating\n\nto peonage and slavery; offenses relating to retaliation against\n\na witness, victim, or an information; and offenses relating to\n\nassisting illegal aliens to enter the country.‖ Id. at *16.\n\n\n       Thus, including certain immigration violations as\n\npredicate   acts   under    RICO      ―enable[d]    federal   law\n\nenforcement officials to use the RICO law to combat alien\n\nsmuggling operations.‖ Id. at *9. The action was necessary\n\nbecause ―[o]rganized crime rings in this country, with ties to\n\nothers abroad, have developed to prey upon illegal\n\nimmigrants who want to come to the United States.‖ 141\n\nCong. Rec. H1588 (daily ed. Feb. 10, 1995) (statement of\n\nRep. McCollum); see also Bobb v. Att’y. Gen., 458 F.3d 213,\n\n221 (3d Cir. 2006) (noting that AEDPA targeted ―[m]any of\n\nthe crimes . . . committed by persons involved in organized\n\nimmigration crime[,] . . . includ[ing] . . . alien smuggling . . .\n\n\n                                5\n\f[and] trafficking in immigration and other documents . . . .‖)\n\n(citing H.R.

Rather, we are here\n\nconfronted with an everyday landlord-tenant dispute adorned\n\nas a racketeering claim complete with the obligatory treble\n\ndamage request that is both the sine qua non and irresistible\n\nimpulse of so many civil actions under RICO.\n\n\n       In Sedima, the Supreme Court warned: ―in its private\n\ncivil version, RICO is evolving into something quite different\n\nfrom the original conception of its enactors.‖ 473 U.S. at 500\n\n\n                                6\n\f(citation omitted).    This has occurred even though the\n\ncongressional intent underlying RICO could not be clearer.\n\nBoth the Act‘s title and the legislative history demonstrate\n\nthat Congress passed the statute to target organized crime. Id.\n\nat 524 (Powell, J., dissenting); see also H.J. Inc. v.\n\nNorthwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 248 (1989) (―The\n\noccasion for Congress‘ action [in enacting RICO] was the\n\nperceived need to combat organized crime.‖).            Congress\n\ntherefore crafted the broad list of predicate offenses that\n\ntrigger a RICO violation in order to create a weapon with\n\nsufficient flexibility to be effective in extricating society from\n\nthe insidious tentacles of organized crime and all of its\n\ncontinually   evolving    mechanisms      of    infiltration   and\n\ncorruption. As we explained in United States v. Bergrin, 650\n\nF.3d 257, 270-71 (3d Cir. 2011):\n\n\n               Congress intended for RICO to apply to\n       individuals who, through involvement in an\n       enterprise, commit any combination of the\n       many and diverse predicate acts, whether the\n       usual organized crime-type offenses (e.g.,\n       bribery, extortion, gambling), more violent\n       crimes (e.g., murder, kidnapping), or more\n       niche crimes (e.g., counterfeiting music or\n       trafficking in illicit prescription drugs).\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fThe broad array of crimes that Congress selected as RICO\n\npredicate offenses are thus intended to function as ―hidden\n\ntreasures—or buried landmines—‖ that can be exploited by\n\ncreative counsel in an appropriate case.2\n\n\n         However, the very strength of RICO—its breadth—\n\nnow diffuses its focus. RICO‘s treble damage provision has\n\nbeen seized upon to convert the statute into a hodgepodge of\n\nprohibitions that now function as a tripwire that offers the\n\nlure of treble recovery to all who can squeeze their claim into\n\nsome combination of RICO‘s ―predicate acts.‖           The civil\n\npenalties in RICO have thus been transformed into a fulcrum\n\nthat is used to pry treble damages out of causes of action\n\noriginating in ―divorce, trespass, legal and accounting\n\nmalpractice, inheritance among family members, employment\n\nbenefits and sexual harassment by a union.‖          William H.\n\nRehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, Remarks of the\n\nChief Justice, Address Before the Eleventh Seminar on the\n\nAdministration of Justice (Apr. 7, 1989), in 21 St. Mary‘s\n\nL.J. 5, 11 (1989). In fact, ―[m]ost of the civil suits filed under\n\nthe statute have nothing to do with organized crime[;] [t]hey\n\n\n2\n    Batista, supra, § 3.15.\n                                8\n\fare garden-variety civil fraud cases of the type traditionally\n\nlitigated in state courts.‖ Id. at 9.\n\n\n       In Sedima, the Court mentioned in a footnote that an\n\nABA Task Force on RICO had ―found that of the 270 known\n\ncivil RICO cases at the trial court level [at that time], 40%\n\ninvolved securities fraud, 37% common-law fraud in a\n\ncommercial or business setting, and only 9% [involved]\n\n‗allegations of criminal activity of a type generally associated\n\nwith professional criminals.‘ ‖ 473 U.S. at 500 n.16.\n\nSimilarly, ―[a]nother survey of 132 published decisions found\n\nthat 57 involved securities transactions and 38 [involved]\n\ncommercial and contract disputes . . . .‖ Id. We can now add\n\nlandlord-tenant disputes to the mix.\n\n\n       In the criminal arena, this proclivity for abuse is at\n\nleast limited by prosecutorial discretion, the risk of losing\n\ncredibility with jurors if the prosecution engages in ―overkill‖\n\nor overreaching, and the related risk of jury nullification.\n\nHowever, RICO‘s civil remedy is not restricted by any such\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fconsiderations.3 Thus, it is not surprising that we are today\n\nfaced with a claim that this landlord-tenant dispute is really a\n\nracketeering conspiracy that should entitle this tenant to treble\n\ndamages under RICO.4\n\n\n\n3\n  See Rehnquist, Remarks, supra, at 10 (―[T]here is no such\nthing as prosecutorial discretion to limit the use of civil RICO\nby plaintiffs‘ attorneys.‖).\n        Even though one could argue that jury nullification\nplays a role in deterring abuse in the civil arena as well,\ncommon sense would suggest that the very different\ndynamics that are at work there make jury nullification or fear\nof overreaching far less important to determining how to\nstructure a civil suit when jurors know ―it‘s only money.‖\nMoreover, strategic considerations such as settlement posture\nmay play a far more important role in deciding how to draft a\ncivil complaint than concerns about overreaching or jury\nnullification.\n4\n        I do not suggest that landlord-tenant disputes and\norganized crime are necessarily mutually exclusive. The\nlegislative history of RICO illustrates that organized crime is\nmore than capable of injecting its poisonous proboscis into\nalmost any ―enterprise,‖ including the business of renting\nproperty. See e.g., Swistock v. Jones, 884 F.2d 755, 759 (3d\nCir. 1989) (reversing district court dismissal of RICO claim\nof inducing plaintiffs to enter into a lease and make payments\nunder the lease); Charron v. Pinnacle Grp. N.Y. LLC, 269\nF.R.D. 221, 234 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (―Defendants are correct\nthat there is an aspect of this case that implicates\nindividualized landlord-tenant disputes. But each landlord-\ntenant dispute is, according to Plaintiffs, more than just that;\nit is one of the hundreds, if not thousands, of pixels forming\nsomething larger, more uniform, and far more serious—a\npattern of racketeering actionable under RICO. This is, in\nshort, a RICO class action brought in federal district court,\nnot a collection of landlord-tenant disputes . . . .‖).\n        Furthermore, creative counsel can hardly be faulted for\nresorting to this statute in representing clients as long as the\n                               10\n\f       III.\n\n\n       Some courts have tried to address this problem by\n\nrelying on such traditional concepts as prudential standing.5\n\n\n\nstatute remains as broad as it is now. See Sedima, 472 U.S. at\n504 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (―[L]itigants, lured by the\nprospect of treble damages and attorney‘s fees, have a strong\nincentive to invoke RICO‘s provisions whenever they can\nallege in good faith‖ two predicate acts from the statute‘s\nsubstantial list of predicate offenses.); Rehnquist, Remarks,\nsupra, at 12 (―RICO‘s treble damages provisions create a\npowerful incentive for attorneys to attempt to bring facts\ntraditionally thought to establish other causes of action within\nthe ambit of the statute.‖). Thus, I do not suggest counsel for\nthis plaintiff has acted improperly in fashioning this claim as\na RICO violation.\n5\n      Standing involves constitutional, prudential, and often\nstatutory limitations on who may bring a claim in federal\ncourt. Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750-51 (1984); see also\nThe Pitt News v. Fisher, 215 F.3d 354, 359 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       The constitutional component [of standing],\n       derived from the Art. III case or controversy\n       requirement, requires a plaintiff to demonstrate\n       that he or she suffered injury in fact, that the\n       injury is fairly traceable to the actions of the\n       defendant, and that the injury will likely be\n       redressed by a favorable decision.\n                               ***\n               Under certain circumstances, prudential,\n       as opposed to constitutional, standing\n       considerations limit a plaintiff‘s ability to bring\n       suit. These prudential considerations are a set of\n       judge-made rules forming an integral part of\n       judicial self-government. The aim of this form\n       of judicial self-governance is to determine\n                               11\n\fOne such effort involved requiring plaintiffs to establish\n\n―RICO standing‖ just as antitrust standing is required of a\n\nplaintiff suing for an antitrust violation under the Clayton\n\nAct. See Sedima, 473 U.S. at 485. The Court of Appeals for\n\nthe Second Circuit used that approach in Sedima in upholding\n\nthe District Court‘s dismissal of the civil RICO action there.\n\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that a RICO plaintiff must\n\nallege a separate ―RICO injury‖ ―just as an antitrust plaintiff\n\nmust allege an ‗antitrust injury.‘‖ Id. The Court of Appeals\n\nhad imposed that requirement based on the legislative history\n\nand the strong congressional concern with providing\n\nadditional tools against organized crime that lead to RICO‘s\n\nenactment. Id. at 494.6\n\n\n\n\n       whether the plaintiff is a proper party to invoke\n       judicial resolution of the dispute and the\n       exercise of the court‘s remedial powers.\n\nConte Bros. Auto., Inc. v. Quaker State –Slick 50, Inc., 165\nF.3d 221, 225 (3d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted).\n6\n  The Supreme Court noted that: ―[i]n summarizing the bill\n[that became RICO] on the House floor, its sponsor described\nthe treble damages provision as ‗another example of the\nantitrust remedy being adapted for use against organized\ncriminality.‘ ‖ Sedima, 487 U.S. at 487 (citing 116 Cong.\nRec. 35295 (1970)) (statement of Rep. Poff). The Senate did\nnot object to the inclusion of treble damages because, as the\nSenate sponsor noted, it ―would be ‗a major new tool in\n                              12\n\f     The Supreme Court rejected that reasoning.               In\n\nreviewing the legislative history of RICO, the Court noted\n\nthat the treble damages provision was added to ―enhance the\n\neffectiveness of [the Act‘s prohibitions].‖ Id. at 487 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). The Court observed\n\nthat several courts had struggled to define ―racketeering\n\ninjury,‖ but the Court concluded: ―the difficulty of that task\n\nitself cautions against imposing such a requirement.‖ Id. at\n\n494 (footnote omitted). The Court explained:\n\n\n       [g]iven that ―racketeering activity‖ [under\n       the Act] consists of no more and no less than\n       commission of a predicate act, § 1961(1),\n       we are initially doubtful about a requirement\n       of a ―racketeering injury‖ separate from the\n       harm from the predicate acts. A reading of\n       the statute belies any such requirement . . ..\n       If the defendant engages in a pattern of\n       racketeering activity in a manner forbidden\n       by these provisions, and the racketeering\n       activities injure the plaintiff in his[/her]\n       business or property, the plaintiff has a\n       claim under § 1964(c). There is no room in\n       the statutory language for an additional,\n       amorphous          ―racketeering       injury‖\n       requirement.\n\n\n\n\nextirpating the baneful influence of organized crime in our\neconomic life.‘ ‖ Sedima, 487 U.S. at 488 (citing 116 Cong.\nRec. at 25190) (statement of Senator McClellan).\n                              13\n\fSedima, 487 U.S. at 495 (footnote omitted).7 Thus, the Court\n\ninstructed, ―RICO is to be read broadly.‖ Id. at 497.\n\n       Yet, despite rejecting a requirement of ―RICO\n\nstanding,‖ in Sedima, the Court nevertheless requires an\n\ninjury sufficiently related to the alleged racketeering activity\n\nto justify allowing a treble damage claim to proceed under\n\nRICO. See Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451\n\n(2006); Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258\n\n(1992). The plaintiff in Anza, brought a RICO action against\n\na business competitor alleging that the latter had filed\n\nfraudulent tax returns with the state in order to reduce the\n\namount of sales tax accruing from sales. Anza, 547 U.S. at\n\n454. With a reduced tax burden, the defendant could obtain a\n\ncompetitive advantage by selling its products at a lower price\n\nthan the plaintiff who had to factor sales tax into the price it\n\ncharged its customers.    Id.    The plaintiff alleged that the\n\nrequisite predicate acts for RICO consisted of mail or wire\n\n\n7\n  The Court considered, but rejected any contention that\nCongress did not understand the implications of the treble\ndamages provision. The Court reasoned that the provision\nwas not enacted unnoticed and concluded that the statute‘s\nsilence on the import of the provision was irrelevant because\n―congressional silence, no matter how ‗clanging,‘ cannot\noverride the words of the statute.‖ Sedima, 473 U.S. at 495\nn.13.\n                                14\n\ffraud depending on whether the fraudulent returns were\n\nmailed or filed electronically. Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected the claim because the\n\nalleged injury was too remote from the alleged racketeering\n\nactivity. Id. at 457-58. The direct victim of the predicate acts\n\nwas the taxing authority, not the plaintiff.      Id. Although\n\nplaintiff would not have suffered its injury ―but for‖ the\n\nalleged racketeering activity, the defendant‘s lower prices\n\nproximately caused any business injury to plaintiff, not the\n\nalleged fraud. Id. at 458-59.\n\n       Although the Court‘s approach was consistent with a\n\nprudential standing analysis, the Court did not even mention\n\nstanding in its discussion except to refer to the district court‘s\n\nreasoning. Rather, the Court relied on Sedima to explain that\n\nthe ―harm caused by predicate acts‖ must have a direct\n\nrelationship to the alleged injury. Id. at 457 (citing Sedima,\n\n473 U.S. at 497). The Court reiterated: ―the essence of the\n\n[RICO] violation is the commission of those acts in\n\nconnection with the conduct of an enterprise.‖ Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Although the injury in Sedima was\n\nestablished by alleging an injury ―by reason of‖ the alleged\n\nracketeering activity, the injury in Anza was too attenuated\n\n                                15\n\ffrom that activity to justify a RICO claim even though the\n\nplaintiff would not have suffered injury ―but for‖ the\n\nracketeering activity. Anza, 547 U.S. at 457-59.\n\n       The Court was also concerned that the plaintiff‘s lost\n\nsales could have resulted from any number of factors ―other\n\nthan [defendant‘s] alleged acts of fraud.‖ Id. The Court\n\nreasoned that it would be extraordinarily difficult to properly\n\napportion damages among the various factors that may have\n\ncontributed to plaintiff‘s lost sales that were in addition to the\n\ndefendant‘s lower prices. Id.\n\n       The analysis in Anza was foreshadowed by the Court‘s\n\nprior decision in Holmes. There, the Court had explained the\n\npractical and jurisprudential necessity of ensuring that alleged\n\ninjuries were not too remote from the alleged racketeering\n\nacts to establish proximate cause for the plaintiff‘s injuries.\n\n503 U.S. at 268-69. The analysis in Anza flowed directly\n\nfrom the need to establish causation. The majority decision in\n\nHolmes did not mention prudential standing either, and the\n\nCourt only referred to ―standing‖ tangentially. See 503 U.S.\n\nat 263, 264, 270.\n\n       Whether the analysis focuses on the nexus between the\n\nalleged injury and the alleged racketeering activity through\n\n                                16\n\fthe lens of proximate cause or through the lens of prudential\n\nstanding, the only limitation on treble damage claims appears\n\nto be ensuring that the claimed injury is not too remote from\n\nthe alleged predicate acts.8      Thus, in Allegheny General\n\nHospital v. Philip Morris, Inc., 228 F.3d 429 (3d Cir. 2000),\n\nwe focused our inquiry on the nexus between predicate acts\n\nand injury. We there upheld the dismissal of various RICO\n\nclaims brought by hospitals to recover unreimbursed medical\n\nexpenses allegedly resulting from the defendant cigarette\n\ncompanies‘ fraudulent claims about tobacco use and their\n\nalleged manipulation of nicotine content of cigarettes. Id. at\n\n443-45. We relied upon our earlier decision in the ―closely\n\nanalogous‖ case of Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare\n\nFund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912 (3d Cir. 1999). In\n\nthe latter case, union welfare funds had asserted similar\n\nclaims under RICO.        228 F.3d at 435.     We explained in\n\nAllegheny    that   the   plaintiffs‘   standing   depended   on\n\n―[w]hether . . . the alleged conspiracy proximately caused [the\n\nplaintiffs‘] injuries.‖ Id.\n\n\n8\n  ―The Supreme Court has explained that the injury and\ncausation requirements of § 1964(c) are aspects of RICO\nstanding.‖ In re Sunrise Sec. Lit., 916 F.2d 874, 878-89 (3d\nCir. 1990) (citations omitted).\n                                17\n\f    More recently, in Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York,\n\n130 S. Ct. 983 (2010), the Supreme Court specifically\n\nrejected a ―but for‖ test of causation and reiterated that the\n\nRICO injury must be ―by reason of‖ the alleged RICO\n\nviolation. Id. at 989; a concept that leads to a proximate\n\ncause analysis.   That decision also focused on proximate\n\ncause under RICO rather than on prudential standing. The\n\nCourt explained that ―proximate cause for RICO purposes . . .\n\nshould be evaluated in light of its common-law foundations;\n\nproximate cause thus requires some direct relation between\n\nthe injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged. A link\n\nthat is too remote, purely contingent, or indirec[t] is\n\ninsufficient. Id. at 989 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).9\n\n\n\n9\n  In Hemi Group, the City of New York brought a RICO\nclaim against an out of state retailer who sold cigarettes over\nthe internet to New York City residents without disclosing the\nnames of the buyers to the taxing authorities in New York\nCity as required by federal law. The taxing authorities would\nhave used that information to collect the sales tax on the\ncigarettes that would otherwise go uncollected. The Court\nheld that any economic injury the City may have suffered by\nthe allegedly fraudulent conduct was not ―by reason of‖ the\nalleged predicate acts because any failure to disclose was\nsimply too remote to be the proximate cause of the City‘s\ninjury. 130 S. Ct. at 988-89.\n\n                              18\n\f          It nevertheless remains true under Sedima that all a\n\nplaintiff must allege to survive a motion to dismiss a claim for\n\ntreble damages under RICO is that his/her injury occurred ―by\n\nreason of‖ the alleged predicate acts. See Sedima, 473 U.S. at\n\n497 (―Any recoverable damages occurring by reason of a\n\nviolation of § 1962(c) will flow from the commission of the\n\npredicate acts.‖) (footnote omitted). As I have explained, that\n\nhurdle is easily cleared in a multitude of actions that have\n\nnothing to do with organized crime in any of its many\n\nnefarious manifestations. For example, if the plaintiff here\n\nhad been able to allege acts that amounted to actual\n\n―harboring‖ of aliens, his RICO claim would have survived a\n\nmotion to dismiss even though there is absolutely nothing\n\nhere to suggest a criminal organization is involved in the\n\nlandlord‘s alleged neglect.\n\nIV.\n\n          Yet, as the Supreme Court has explained, the misuse of\n\nthe statute cannot be traced to any ambiguity in the statutory\n\ntext that would allow for a judicial remedy by reading the\n\nstatute in a manner that more closely reflects congressional\n\nintent.     ―The preeminent canon of statutory interpretation\n\nrequires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute\n\n                                19\n\fwhat it means and means in a statute what it says there.‖\n\nBedRoc Ltd., v. United States, 541 U.S. 176, 184 (2004)\n\n(internal quotation marks and bracket omitted). ―[T]he fact\n\nthat RICO has been applied in situations not expressly\n\nanticipated by Congress does not demonstrate ambiguity. It\n\ndemonstrates breadth.‖ Sedima, 473 U.S. at 499 (citation\n\nomitted). Thus, it remains true that:\n\n       private civil actions under the statute are being\n       brought almost solely against [businesses not\n       implicated in organized crime], rather than\n       against the archetypal, intimidating mobster.\n       Yet this defect—if defect it is—is inherent in\n       the statute as written, and its correction must lie\n       with Congress. It is not for the judiciary to\n       eliminate the private action in situations where\n       Congress has provided it simply because\n       plaintiffs are not taking advantage of it in its\n       more difficult applications.\n\nId. at 499-500 (footnote omitted).\n       Given the very legitimate and widespread concerns\n\nabout how the treble damage provision of RICO is pushing\n\nRICO far beyond the parameters Congress intended, I join the\n\nchorus expressing the need for Congress to revisit this very\n\nimportant statute.10 With reform, it can yet be honed into a\n\n\n10\n  See, e.g., Ideal Steel Supply Corp. v. Anza, 652 F.3d 310,\n328 (2d Cir. 2011) (Cabranes, J., dissenting) (―We encounter\nhere another chapter in the long saga of civil RICO and its\ndiscontents. Since its enactment in 1970, the civil RICO\n                               20\n\ftool that will continue to be effective in remedying the havoc\n\nwreaked by organized crime while being less susceptible to\n\nbeing the remedy of choice whenever it appears that a\n\ndefendant‘s transgressions can be recast as racketeering\n\npredicates.\n\n\n       Congress has, in fact, recognized that a problem exists\n\nwith RICO in its current form. See RICO Amendments Act\n\nof 1991, H.R. Rep. No. 102-312 (1991), 1991 WL 243408 at\n\n*6-8; Rehnquist, Remarks, supra, at 12.

I take no position on specific proposals,\nbut encourage Congress to be as creative in its solutions as\nlitigants have been in their use of the statute.\n                              22\n\f",

As a result of the Property Managers‟ conduct,\nBolmer claims his apartment complex fell into disrepair,\ndefects and violations were no longer fixed, common areas\nwere rarely cleaned, and criminal activity went unreported.\nThus, he says he suffered injury to his leasehold property.\nThe District Court granted the Property Managers‟ Motion to\nDismiss, holding that Bolmer failed to state a claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted, and he now appeals. For the\nreasons that follow, we will affirm.\n\n                             I.\n\n                             A.\n\n       Mr. Bolmer has resided in the Pingry Arms building in\nPlainfield, New Jersey since February 2004. At some point\nafter he moved in, the apartment building came under the\nmanagement of Connolly Properties.1 Bolmer alleges that,\n\n1\n  The date when this change in management occurred is not\nrevealed in the record.\n\n\n\n\n                             4\n\fafter Connolly Properties began managing his building, the\napartment complex fell into disrepair. Specifically, he claims\nthat Connolly Properties provided inadequate heat; failed to\nrepair locks, his air conditioner, and the roof; failed to\nregularly clean common areas; allowed the building to\nbecome infested with bugs and rodents; permitted\novercrowding, flooding, and mold; and turned a blind eye to\ncriminal activity on the premises.\n\n        Bolmer asserts that, no later than January 2006, the\nProperty Managers developed a scheme wherein they actively\nsought out aliens lacking lawful immigration status as\nprospective tenants. They did so, he says, by hiring a\nSpanish-speaking leasing agent and directing her to handwrite\nflyers in Spanish to advertise vacancies. Bolmer claims that\nthe Property Managers told the leasing agent to ask all\nSpanish-speaking prospective tenants whether they were in\nthis country lawfully and to exempt any aliens not lawfully\npresent from the normal requirements of presenting\nidentification and submitting to commercial background\nscreenings. According to Bolmer, the Property Managers\nspecifically sought out these individuals as tenants because\nthey believed that they were less likely to complain about\npoor housing conditions or to report housing code violations\nto the authorities. He maintains that, by renting a substantial\nnumber of apartments to aliens not lawfully present, the\nProperty Managers were able to allow their buildings to\ndeteriorate into “slum-like conditions” without offering their\ntenants any reduction in rent. Bolmer further asserts that the\nProperty Managers segregated those tenants whom they\nbelieved to lack lawful immigration status into particular\nbuildings “to avoid their detection by law enforcement and\nother officials.” Appellant‟s Br. 16. He maintains that the\n\n\n\n\n                              5\n\fProperty Managers “acted on a belief that „mixing‟ a largely\nHispanic illegal alien tenant population among African-\nAmerican citizen tenants would provoke disturbances and\nfights caused by animus between citizens and illegal aliens,\nand result in entry by law enforcement officer [sic] onto the\npremises to conduct investigations and arrests.” Id. at 17.\n\n                                   B.\n\n        Plaintiffs filed this suit in June 2008 and subsequently\namended their complaint twice, filing their Second Amended\nComplaint in December 2008. In Count I, Bolmer alleged\nthat the Property Managers violated the conspiracy provision\nof the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act\n(“RICO”), 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). Specifically, he claimed that\nthe Property Managers entered into a conspiracy to engage in\nan “Illegal Alien Rental Scheme” by renting apartments to\naliens not lawfully present under the theory that they were\nless likely to complain about their housing conditions (or to\ndemand a rent reduction in light of those conditions). The\nalleged result of this conspiracy was to deny Bolmer and\nother lawful tenants the full value of their leasehold by\nenabling the Property Managers to keep the apartment\ncomplex in poor condition without reducing rents.\n\n       The Property Managers filed a Motion to Dismiss\nCount I under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The\nDistrict Court granted their motion, dismissing Count I with\nprejudice and denying Bolmer‟s Motion for Leave to File a\nThird Amended Complaint. The District Court held that\nBolmer failed to allege the predicate act of harboring and that\nhe therefore failed to state a RICO conspiracy claim upon\nwhich relief could be granted. Bolmer filed a Motion for\n\n\n\n\n                               6\n\fReconsideration, which the District Court denied. Bolmer\nthen filed a motion for partial final judgment on the District\nCourt‟s April and September Orders, pursuant to Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 54(b), which the Court granted.\n\n       Bolmer now appeals the District Court‟s decision.2\n\n                                   II.\n\n        We exercise plenary review over the District Court‟s\ngrant of defendants‟ motion to dismiss.

In support of his claim that this conduct constitutes\nharboring, Bolmer directs our attention to cases from our\nsister circuits that have found harboring violations.

Here, the Property Managers\n\n\n\n\n                             11\n\fwere not required to disclose their tenants‟ identities or\nimmigration status to federal or state authorities, nor did they\nbring their tenants into this country, offer them assistance in\nprocuring false documents, impede a law enforcement\ninvestigation, or pay to rent apartments on their behalf so as\nto keep their names off of the leases. We do not know of any\ncourt of appeals that has held that knowingly renting an\napartment to an alien lacking lawful immigration status\nconstitutes harboring. Indeed, we believe that such a holding\nwould be contrary to our prior opinion in Ozcelik, because\nsuch conduct does not constitute the type of “substantial\nfacilitation” that we require to make out a harboring offense.\n\n        Moreover, even assuming we were to find that the\nProperty Managers substantially facilitated such aliens\nremaining in the United States, the Ozcelik test also requires\nBolmer to show that their conduct tended to “prevent\ngovernment authorities from detecting the alien‟s unlawful\npresence.” Ozcelik, 527 F.3d at 100. He has not alleged facts\nthat show such conduct. The two specific acts that Bolmer\nsuggests constituted “acts of obstruction” were 1) exempting\naliens not lawfully present from background checks and 2)\nsegregating them into specific rental buildings. However,\nthese actions did not actually hinder immigration authorities‟\ndetection of undocumented tenants. First, landlords have no\nobligation to require background checks of their tenants, so\nthe Property Managers did not evade any federal or state\nreporting requirements. Moreover, Bolmer did not allege that\nthird party background check screeners could or would have\ndetermined rental applicants‟ immigration status or that they\nwould have passed such status information along to\nimmigration authorities. Second, by grouping large numbers\nof undocumented individuals into specific apartment\n\n\n\n\n                              12\n\fbuildings, the Property Managers arguably made the\nundocumented population more conspicuous, both to Bolmer\nand to the authorities. Bolmer noted that, “[b]efore CPI\nbegan managing the Pingry Arms property, mostly African-\nAmerican and Caucasian tenants resided at the property.\nDuring CPI‟s management of Pingry Arms, [he] . . . observed\nthe evolution of the tenants to majority Hispanic, and few\nspeak English [sic].” Pl.‟s SAC ¶¶ 70-71. He describes his\nbuilding today as an “illegal alien slum,” id. ¶ 73, and it is\nclear that he found his allegedly undocumented alien\nneighbors to be more visible as they increased in number.\n\n       While Bolmer has plausibly asserted that the Property\nManagers sought to conceal their own violations of local\nhousing code and of federal prohibitions against\ndiscrimination in housing, he has not shown that they did\nanything to prevent their undocumented residents from being\napprehended by immigration authorities. Certainly, as in\nOzcelik, the Property Managers were likely aware that some\nof their residents lacked lawful immigration status and did\nnothing to alert federal authorities to this fact. The picture\nBolmer paints, however, is one of a company whose\nleadership cared little of what happened to its tenants so long\nas Connolly Properties received a steady stream of rental\nincome from any source. Bolmer has alleged that the\nProperty Managers engaged in a great deal of unsavory and\npossibly discriminatory behavior. However, he has not\nsufficiently alleged that their conduct “„tend[ed] to\nsubstantially facilitate an alien‟s remaining in the United\nStates illegally‟ and to prevent government authorities from\ndetecting the alien‟s unlawful presence.” Ozcelik, 527 F.3d at\n100. Thus, the District Court properly dismissed his\nharboring claim.\n\n\n\n\n                              13\n\f                                   B.\n\n       Bolmer also asserts that the Property Managers\nviolated 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv), which penalizes a\nperson who “encourages or induces an alien to come to, enter,\nor reside in the United States, knowing or in reckless\ndisregard of the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence\nis or will be in violation of law.” As described above, in\norder to make out a claim for harboring in our circuit, it must\nbe shown that the alleged violator “substantially facilitated”\nan alien not lawfully present remaining in the United States.\nSimilarly, we believe that encouragement or inducement must\nalso be “substantial” to support a conviction under the statute.\nThis means not just general advice (as the Ozcelik defendant\nprovided) but some affirmative assistance that makes an alien\nlacking lawful immigration status more likely to enter or\nremain in the United States than she otherwise might have\nbeen. “Induce” is defined as “to move by persuasion or\ninfluence; to call forth or bring about by influence or\nstimulation; to cause the formation of; or to produce,”\nMERRIAM-WEBSTER ONLINE DICTIONARY, available at\nwww.merriam-webster.com, and that word plainly refers to\nconduct that causes someone to do something that they might\notherwise not do. Moreover, “[t]he ordinary and common\nsense meaning of „encourage‟ implies an affirmative act that\nserves as a catalyst or trigger that drives, motivates, or spurs\nanother individual to embark on a course of action that he\nmight not have otherwise.” United States v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78516\"><a href=\"/opinion/78516/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1259 (11th Cir. 2009) (Barkett, J., dissenting). Thus,\n“encourage” is best defined as “„[t]o instigate; to incite to\naction; to give courage to; to inspirit; to embolden; to raise\nconfidence; to make confident.‟” Id. (quoting BLACK‟S LAW\nDICTIONARY 620 (4th ed. 1968)).              These definitions\n\n\n\n\n                              14\n\fdemonstrate that the word “encourage,” in the context of this\nstatute, also refers to conduct that causes someone to do\nsomething that they otherwise might not do.\n\n        Indeed, reading the encouraging or inducing\nsubsection of the statute too broadly risks rendering the\nremaining subsections of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A) redundant\nor superfluous. Subsection (i) prohibits bringing an alien\nlacking lawful immigration status to the United States other\nthan at a designated port of entry. Subsection (ii) prohibits\ntransporting such an alien within the United States in\nfurtherance of their illegal presence in this country. Finally,\nsubsection (iii), which we have already discussed at length,\nprohibits harboring an alien not lawfully present. If we define\n“encourage” merely as “to help,” then the particular conduct\nthat is prohibited in subsections (i)-(iii) is subsumed by the\ngeneral prohibition against helping an undocumented person\nto “come to, enter, or reside in” the United States in\nsubsection (iv). “It is a well known canon of statutory\nconstruction that courts should construe statutory language to\navoid interpretations that would render any phrase\nsuperfluous.” United States v. Cooper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789054\"><a href=\"/opinion/789054/united-states-v-sarun-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 312 (3d\nCir. 2005); see also Lopez, 590 F.3d at 1259 (“„A basic\npremise of statutory construction is that a statute is to be\ninterpreted so that no words shall be discarded as being\nmeaningless, redundant, or mere surplusage.‟” (quoting\nUnited States v. Canals-Jimenez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567762\"><a href=\"/opinion/567762/united-states-v-juan-ramon-canals-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287 (11th\nCir. 1991))). Accordingly, we read subsection (iv) as\nprohibiting a person from engaging in an affirmative act that\nsubstantially encourages or induces an alien lacking lawful\nimmigration status to come to, enter, or reside in the United\nStates where the undocumented person otherwise might not\nhave done so. Thus, subsection (iv) has the distinct character\n\n\n\n\n                              15\n\fof foreclosing the type of substantial assistance that will spur\na person to commit a violation of immigration law where they\notherwise might not have.\n\n        The Property Managers in this case did not engage in\nan affirmative act that served as a catalyst for aliens to reside\nin the United States in violation of immigration law when\nthey might not have otherwise. Bolmer suggests that the\nProperty Managers provided aliens not lawfully present with\nrental housing, which other companies would not do, thereby\nencouraging them to reside in the United States when they\notherwise might not have. However, Bolmer did not allege\nthat these aliens would not or could not have resided in the\nUnited States without renting apartments in Connolly\nProperties‟ buildings. Nor, given the facts of this case, would\nsuch an assertion have been facially plausible, as the motion\nto dismiss standard requires. See Warren Hosp. v. Amgen,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"218768\"><a href=\"/opinion/218768/warren-gen-hosp-v-amgen-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 (3d Cir. 2011). Among other things,\nmany aliens are eligible for federal public housing benefits\neven if they live in households in which some members are\naliens not lawfully present. See ALISON SISKIN & MAGGIE\nMCCARTY,         CONGRESSIONAL         RESEARCH        SERVICE,\nIMMIGRATION: NONCITIZEN ELIGIBILITY FOR NEEDS-BASED\nHOUSING PROGRAMS (2008). This suggests that aliens\nlacking lawful immigration status are able to reside in this\ncountry with or without the assistance of the Property\nManagers‟ alleged rental scheme. Moreover, there is no legal\nrequirement that apartment managers screen potential tenants\nbased on immigration status, and in some places it is actually\nillegal to do so. See Note, “There Be No Shelter Here”: Anti-\nImmigrant Housing Ordinances and Comprehensive Reform,\n20 CORNELL J. L. & PUB. POL‟Y 399, (2010) (“California, for\nexample [has] enact[ed] legislation barring landlords from\n\n\n\n\n                               16\n\fasking tenants their legal status . . . . New York City also has\nan ordinance prohibiting landlords from questioning tenants\nabout their legal status or discriminating against them based\non alienage or citizenship.”). Thus, Bolmer cannot show that\nthe Property Managers‟ conduct incited aliens to remain in\nthis country unlawfully when they otherwise might not have\ndone so, and he therefore has not alleged that they engaged in\nconduct sufficient to constitute encouraging or inducing.\n\n        We recognize that some of our sister circuits have\nchosen to define “encouraging or inducing” more broadly\nthan we do here. See Edwards, 602 F.3d at 1295 (affirming a\nconviction for encouraging or inducing where the defendants\nhired and actively sought out individuals known to be\nundocumented and also provided them with names and social\nsecurity numbers to facilitate their illegal employment);\nLopez, 590 F.3d at 1249-52 (defining “encouraging or\ninducing” to include the act of “helping” aliens come to,\nenter, or remain in the United States and upholding Lopez‟s\nconviction for encouraging or inducing where he captained a\nboat to the Bahamas, refueled it, spent the night, picked up\naliens who lacked lawful immigration status from a hotel, and\nthen drove them toward the United States in the boat); United\nStates v. Fujii, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778891\"><a href=\"/opinion/778891/united-states-v-masao-fujii-aka-yasuo-tamura/\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (7th Cir. 2002) (“To prove\nthat Fujii „encouraged or induced‟ the aliens, all that the\ngovernment needed to establish was that Fujii knowingly\nhelped or advised the aliens.”). Nevertheless, while setting a\nseemingly low bar (i.e. “to help”) these cases have found that\nencouraging or inducing occurred only where defendants\nwere personally involved in bringing aliens lacking lawful\nimmigration status into the United States. The defendant in\nFujii, for example, accompanied such aliens on their trip to\nthe United States, while the Lopez defendant conveyed aliens\n\n\n\n\n                              17\n\ftoward the Untied States via boat. Thus, we are not\nconvinced that these circuits would agree that giving any type\nof “help” to an alien not lawfully present, no matter how de\nminimis the assistance, constitutes the crime of encouraging\nor inducing.\n\n        Moreover, defining the conduct at issue in this case as\nencouraging or inducing runs the risk of criminalizing actions\ncontemplated by federal law and undermining the federal\nsystem of immigration enforcement. Persons who currently\nlack lawful immigration status may nonetheless reside in the\nUnited States, often with the explicit knowledge or even\npermission of the federal government. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §\n1158 (authorizing the grant of asylum to refugees who are\nfleeing persecution abroad); 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i) (allowing\naliens to adjust their status to lawful permanent resident); 8\nU.S.C. § 1229b(b) (providing relief from deportation to\ncertain persons otherwise subject to removal); 8 C.F.R. §\n244.2 (granting certain aliens temporary protected status); 8\nC.F.R. § 274a.12(c)(8)-(11), (14) (defining categories of\naliens lacking lawful immigration status who are eligible to\nreceive an employment authorization document). We cannot\nimagine that Congress contemplated that our nation‟s\nlandlords (not to mention our hotel and motel operators,\ninnkeepers, and others who are in the business of providing\naccommodations) would be tasked with making complex\nlegal determinations about who is permitted to live in this\ncountry, much less that they would be criminalized for an\nerror in so doing. Thus, we believe that our interpretation of\nthe encouraging and inducing statute best comports with the\nlarger scheme of federal immigration law.\n\n                             III.\n\n\n\n\n                              18\n\f       Bolmer also argues that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion by refusing to allow him to amend his complaint\nfor a third time in order to plead additional facts that would\ndemonstrate that the Property Managers prevented their\nundocumented residents from being detected by law\nenforcement.

Those\n\nallegations are a far cry from what Congress intended when it\n\nadded certain immigration violations to the already expansive\n\nlist of predicate acts that would support a civil RICO claim.\n\n\n       Bolmer rests his RICO claim solely upon alleged\n\nviolations of the Immigration and Nationality Act (―INA‖).\n\nRICO was amended to define ―racketeering activity‖ to\n\ninclude: ―any act which is indictable under the Immigration\n\nand Nationality Act, section 274 (relating to bringing in and\n\nharboring certain aliens) . . . .‖    18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(F)\n\n(2006).     Section 274, which is now a RICO predicate\n\noffense, prohibits the bringing in, transportation, harboring, or\n\nemployment of undocumented aliens.           8 U.S.C. § 1324\n\n(2006). ―[A] violation of § 274 of the INA is one of the\n\ninfrequently used ‗racketeering acts‘ identified in RICO §\n\n1961(1).‖ Paul Batista, Civil RICO Practice Manual, § 3.15\n\n(3d ed.

Pub. L. No. 104-\n\n132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996). In fact, § 433 of AEDPA is\n\nentitled: ―Establishing Certain Alien Smuggling-Related\n\nCrimes as RICO-Predicate Offenses.‖              Those ―RICO\n\nAmendments‖ primarily focus on unlawful assistance to\n\nundocumented persons entering the country and those who\n\nhelp them evade law enforcement while here.1\n\n\n\n1\n    See AEDPA § 433.\n\n        Establishing Certain Alien Smuggling-Related Crimes\n        as RICO-Predicate Offenses: Section 1961(1) of title\n        18, United States Code, is amended—\n        (1) by inserting ―section 1028 (relating to fraud and\n        related activity in connection with identification\n        documents) if the act indictable under section 1028\n        was committed for the purpose of financial gain,‖\n        before ―section 1029‖;\n        (2) by inserting ―section 1542 (relating to false\n        statement in application and use of passport) if the act\n        indictable under section 1542 was committed for the\n        purpose of financial gain, section 1543 (relating to\n        forgery or false use of passport) if the act indictable\n        under section 1543 was committed for the purpose of\n                                3\n\f      Congressional concern with smuggling organizations\n\nis evident in the text, history, and purpose of the AEDPA\n\namendments to RICO.

The\n      RICO statute is among the principal tools that Federal\n      law enforcement officials use to combat organized\n      crime.

Congress\n\ntherefore crafted the broad list of predicate offenses that\n\ntrigger a RICO violation in order to create a weapon with\n\nsufficient flexibility to be effective in extricating society from\n\nthe insidious tentacles of organized crime and all of its\n\ncontinually   evolving    mechanisms      of    infiltration   and\n\ncorruption. As we explained in United States v. Bergrin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 270-71 (3d Cir. 2011):\n\n\n               Congress intended for RICO to apply to\n       individuals who, through involvement in an\n       enterprise, commit any combination of the\n       many and diverse predicate acts, whether the\n       usual organized crime-type offenses (e.g.,\n       bribery, extortion, gambling), more violent\n       crimes (e.g., murder, kidnapping), or more\n       niche crimes (e.g., counterfeiting music or\n       trafficking in illicit prescription drugs).\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fThe broad array of crimes that Congress selected as RICO\n\npredicate offenses are thus intended to function as ―hidden\n\ntreasures—or buried landmines—‖ that can be exploited by\n\ncreative counsel in an appropriate case.2\n\n\n         However, the very strength of RICO—its breadth—\n\nnow diffuses its focus. RICO‘s treble damage provision has\n\nbeen seized upon to convert the statute into a hodgepodge of\n\nprohibitions that now function as a tripwire that offers the\n\nlure of treble recovery to all who can squeeze their claim into\n\nsome combination of RICO‘s ―predicate acts.‖           The civil\n\npenalties in RICO have thus been transformed into a fulcrum\n\nthat is used to pry treble damages out of causes of action\n\noriginating in ―divorce, trespass, legal and accounting\n\nmalpractice, inheritance among family members, employment\n\nbenefits and sexual harassment by a union.‖          William H.\n\nRehnquist, Chief Justice of the United States, Remarks of the\n\nChief Justice, Address Before the Eleventh Seminar on the\n\nAdministration of Justice (Apr. 7, 1989), in 21 St. Mary‘s\n\nL.J. 5, 11 (1989). In fact, ―[m]ost of the civil suits filed under\n\nthe statute have nothing to do with organized crime[;] [t]hey\n\n\n2\n    Batista, supra, § 3.15.\n                                8\n\fare garden-variety civil fraud cases of the type traditionally\n\nlitigated in state courts.‖ Id. at 9.\n\n\n       In Sedima, the Court mentioned in a footnote that an\n\nABA Task Force on RICO had ―found that of the 270 known\n\ncivil RICO cases at the trial court level [at that time], 40%\n\ninvolved securities fraud, 37% common-law fraud in a\n\ncommercial or business setting, and only 9% [involved]\n\n‗allegations of criminal activity of a type generally associated\n\nwith professional criminals.‘ ‖ 473 U.S. at 500 n.16.\n\nSimilarly, ―[a]nother survey of 132 published decisions found\n\nthat 57 involved securities transactions and 38 [involved]\n\ncommercial and contract disputes . . . .‖ Id. We can now add\n\nlandlord-tenant disputes to the mix.\n\n\n       In the criminal arena, this proclivity for abuse is at\n\nleast limited by prosecutorial discretion, the risk of losing\n\ncredibility with jurors if the prosecution engages in ―overkill‖\n\nor overreaching, and the related risk of jury nullification.\n\nHowever, RICO‘s civil remedy is not restricted by any such\n\n\n\n\n                                 9\n\fconsiderations.3 Thus, it is not surprising that we are today\n\nfaced with a claim that this landlord-tenant dispute is really a\n\nracketeering conspiracy that should entitle this tenant to treble\n\ndamages under RICO.4\n\n\n\n3\n  See Rehnquist, Remarks, supra, at 10 (―[T]here is no such\nthing as prosecutorial discretion to limit the use of civil RICO\nby plaintiffs‘ attorneys.‖).\n        Even though one could argue that jury nullification\nplays a role in deterring abuse in the civil arena as well,\ncommon sense would suggest that the very different\ndynamics that are at work there make jury nullification or fear\nof overreaching far less important to determining how to\nstructure a civil suit when jurors know ―it‘s only money.‖\nMoreover, strategic considerations such as settlement posture\nmay play a far more important role in deciding how to draft a\ncivil complaint than concerns about overreaching or jury\nnullification.\n4\n        I do not suggest that landlord-tenant disputes and\norganized crime are necessarily mutually exclusive. The\nlegislative history of RICO illustrates that organized crime is\nmore than capable of injecting its poisonous proboscis into\nalmost any ―enterprise,‖ including the business of renting\nproperty.

Poff). The Senate did\nnot object to the inclusion of treble damages because, as the\nSenate sponsor noted, it ―would be ‗a major new tool in\n                              12\n\f     The Supreme Court rejected that reasoning.               In\n\nreviewing the legislative history of RICO, the Court noted\n\nthat the treble damages provision was added to ―enhance the\n\neffectiveness of [the Act‘s prohibitions].‖ Id. at 487 (internal\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted). The Court observed\n\nthat several courts had struggled to define ―racketeering\n\ninjury,‖ but the Court concluded: ―the difficulty of that task\n\nitself cautions against imposing such a requirement.‖ Id. at\n\n494 (footnote omitted). The Court explained:\n\n\n       [g]iven that ―racketeering activity‖ [under\n       the Act] consists of no more and no less than\n       commission of a predicate act, § 1961(1),\n       we are initially doubtful about a requirement\n       of a ―racketeering injury‖ separate from the\n       harm from the predicate acts. A reading of\n       the statute belies any such requirement . . ..\n       If the defendant engages in a pattern of\n       racketeering activity in a manner forbidden\n       by these provisions, and the racketeering\n       activities injure the plaintiff in his[/her]\n       business or property, the plaintiff has a\n       claim under § 1964(c). There is no room in\n       the statutory language for an additional,\n       amorphous          ―racketeering       injury‖\n       requirement.\n\n\n\n\nextirpating the baneful influence of organized crime in our\neconomic life.‘ ‖ Sedima, 487 U.S. at 488 (citing 116 Cong.\nRec. at 25190) (statement of Senator McClellan).\n                              13\n\fSedima, 487 U.S. at 495 (footnote omitted).7 Thus, the Court\n\ninstructed, ―RICO is to be read broadly.‖ Id. at 497.\n\n       Yet, despite rejecting a requirement of ―RICO\n\nstanding,‖ in Sedima, the Court nevertheless requires an\n\ninjury sufficiently related to the alleged racketeering activity\n\nto justify allowing a treble damage claim to proceed under\n\nRICO.

The plaintiff in Anza, brought a RICO action against\n\na business competitor alleging that the latter had filed\n\nfraudulent tax returns with the state in order to reduce the\n\namount of sales tax accruing from sales. Anza, 547 U.S. at\n\n454. With a reduced tax burden, the defendant could obtain a\n\ncompetitive advantage by selling its products at a lower price\n\nthan the plaintiff who had to factor sales tax into the price it\n\ncharged its customers.    Id.    The plaintiff alleged that the\n\nrequisite predicate acts for RICO consisted of mail or wire\n\n\n7\n  The Court considered, but rejected any contention that\nCongress did not understand the implications of the treble\ndamages provision. The Court reasoned that the provision\nwas not enacted unnoticed and concluded that the statute‘s\nsilence on the import of the provision was irrelevant because\n―congressional silence, no matter how ‗clanging,‘ cannot\noverride the words of the statute.‖ Sedima, 473 U.S. at 495\nn.13.\n                                14\n\ffraud depending on whether the fraudulent returns were\n\nmailed or filed electronically. Id.\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected the claim because the\n\nalleged injury was too remote from the alleged racketeering\n\nactivity. Id. at 457-58. The direct victim of the predicate acts\n\nwas the taxing authority, not the plaintiff.      Id. Although\n\nplaintiff would not have suffered its injury ―but for‖ the\n\nalleged racketeering activity, the defendant‘s lower prices\n\nproximately caused any business injury to plaintiff, not the\n\nalleged fraud. Id. at 458-59.\n\n       Although the Court‘s approach was consistent with a\n\nprudential standing analysis, the Court did not even mention\n\nstanding in its discussion except to refer to the district court‘s\n\nreasoning. Rather, the Court relied on Sedima to explain that\n\nthe ―harm caused by predicate acts‖ must have a direct\n\nrelationship to the alleged injury. Id. at 457 (citing Sedima,\n\n473 U.S. at 497). The Court reiterated: ―the essence of the\n\n[RICO] violation is the commission of those acts in\n\nconnection with the conduct of an enterprise.‖ Id. (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Although the injury in Sedima was\n\nestablished by alleging an injury ―by reason of‖ the alleged\n\nracketeering activity, the injury in Anza was too attenuated\n\n                                15\n\ffrom that activity to justify a RICO claim even though the\n\nplaintiff would not have suffered injury ―but for‖ the\n\nracketeering activity. Anza, 547 U.S. at 457-59.\n\n       The Court was also concerned that the plaintiff‘s lost\n\nsales could have resulted from any number of factors ―other\n\nthan [defendant‘s] alleged acts of fraud.‖ Id. The Court\n\nreasoned that it would be extraordinarily difficult to properly\n\napportion damages among the various factors that may have\n\ncontributed to plaintiff‘s lost sales that were in addition to the\n\ndefendant‘s lower prices. Id.\n\n       The analysis in Anza was foreshadowed by the Court‘s\n\nprior decision in Holmes. There, the Court had explained the\n\npractical and jurisprudential necessity of ensuring that alleged\n\ninjuries were not too remote from the alleged racketeering\n\nacts to establish proximate cause for the plaintiff‘s injuries.\n\n503 U.S. at 268-69. The analysis in Anza flowed directly\n\nfrom the need to establish causation. The majority decision in\n\nHolmes did not mention prudential standing either, and the\n\nCourt only referred to ―standing‖ tangentially. See 503 U.S.\n\nat 263, 264, 270.\n\n       Whether the analysis focuses on the nexus between the\n\nalleged injury and the alleged racketeering activity through\n\n                                16\n\fthe lens of proximate cause or through the lens of prudential\n\nstanding, the only limitation on treble damage claims appears\n\nto be ensuring that the claimed injury is not too remote from\n\nthe alleged predicate acts.8      Thus, in Allegheny General\n\nHospital v.

Id. at 989; a concept that leads to a proximate\n\ncause analysis.   That decision also focused on proximate\n\ncause under RICO rather than on prudential standing. The\n\nCourt explained that ―proximate cause for RICO purposes . . .\n\nshould be evaluated in light of its common-law foundations;\n\nproximate cause thus requires some direct relation between\n\nthe injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged. A link\n\nthat is too remote, purely contingent, or indirec[t] is\n\ninsufficient. Id. at 989 (internal quotation marks and citations\n\nomitted).9\n\n\n\n9\n  In Hemi Group, the City of New York brought a RICO\nclaim against an out of state retailer who sold cigarettes over\nthe internet to New York City residents without disclosing the\nnames of the buyers to the taxing authorities in New York\nCity as required by federal law. The taxing authorities would\nhave used that information to collect the sales tax on the\ncigarettes that would otherwise go uncollected. The Court\nheld that any economic injury the City may have suffered by\nthe allegedly fraudulent conduct was not ―by reason of‖ the\nalleged predicate acts because any failure to disclose was\nsimply too remote to be the proximate cause of the City‘s\ninjury. 130 S. Ct. at 988-89.\n\n                              18\n\f          It nevertheless remains true under Sedima that all a\n\nplaintiff must allege to survive a motion to dismiss a claim for\n\ntreble damages under RICO is that his/her injury occurred ―by\n\nreason of‖ the alleged predicate acts. See Sedima, 473 U.S. at\n\n497 (―Any recoverable damages occurring by reason of a\n\nviolation of § 1962(c) will flow from the commission of the\n\npredicate acts.‖) (footnote omitted). As I have explained, that\n\nhurdle is easily cleared in a multitude of actions that have\n\nnothing to do with organized crime in any of its many\n\nnefarious manifestations. For example, if the plaintiff here\n\nhad been able to allege acts that amounted to actual\n\n―harboring‖ of aliens, his RICO claim would have survived a\n\nmotion to dismiss even though there is absolutely nothing\n\nhere to suggest a criminal organization is involved in the\n\nlandlord‘s alleged neglect.\n\nIV.\n\n          Yet, as the Supreme Court has explained, the misuse of\n\nthe statute cannot be traced to any ambiguity in the statutory\n\ntext that would allow for a judicial remedy by reading the\n\nstatute in a manner that more closely reflects congressional\n\nintent.     ―The preeminent canon of statutory interpretation\n\nrequires us to presume that the legislature says in a statute\n\n                                19\n\fwhat it means and means in a statute what it says there.‖\n\nBedRoc Ltd., v.

It\n\ndemonstrates breadth.‖ Sedima, 473 U.S. at 499 (citation\n\nomitted). Thus, it remains true that:\n\n       private civil actions under the statute are being\n       brought almost solely against [businesses not\n       implicated in organized crime], rather than\n       against the archetypal, intimidating mobster.\n       Yet this defect—if defect it is—is inherent in\n       the statute as written, and its correction must lie\n       with Congress. It is not for the judiciary to\n       eliminate the private action in situations where\n       Congress has provided it simply because\n       plaintiffs are not taking advantage of it in its\n       more difficult applications.\n\nId. at 499-500 (footnote omitted).\n       Given the very legitimate and widespread concerns\n\nabout how the treble damage provision of RICO is pushing\n\nRICO far beyond the parameters Congress intended, I join the\n\nchorus expressing the need for Congress to revisit this very\n\nimportant statute.10 With reform, it can yet be honed into a\n\n\n10\n  See, e.g., Ideal Steel Supply Corp. v.
