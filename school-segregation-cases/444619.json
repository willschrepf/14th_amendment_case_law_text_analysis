The mandatory injunction also required the defendants to approve a preliminary plat for that area, and for two other areas of the city, all to accommodate the construction of one hundred forty-five Turnkey III low cost public housing units in said areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They further involve the propriety of the order of the District Court, not considered in its published opinion, requiring the City Council to submit to the Court, within 90 days, a comprehensive plan for the integration of the residential neighborhoods of the City of Toledo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property owners in the Ragan Woods Addition filed a motion to intervene as defendants in the suit against the municipal defendants, on the ground that to change the existing comprehensive zoning ordinance to accommodate the construction of low cost housing would depreciate substantially the values of their properties.  The motion to intervene, together with a proposed answer to the complaint, was promptly filed within three days after the municipal defendants had filed their answers to the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge summarily denied the motion without even a hearing, the grounds for denial being that it was untimely filed, that the property owners did not have sufficient interest, and that they were adequately represented by counsel for the municipal defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeals were taken to this Court by the property owners who were denied intervention in case number 74--2116, and by the municipal defendants in case number 74--2320.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The municipal defendants moved for a stay of the District Court's mandatory injunction pending appeal, which stay was granted by the District Court, but only on condition that the City of Toledo execute a supersedeas bond in the amount of $880,709.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The City promptly posted the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in the case were Joseph Skillken &amp; Company (Skillken), a Columbus, Ohio corporation, engaged in the development and construction of residential housing units, Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority (TMHA), Jose Maldonado and Barbara Talley, a Mexican American and a Negro, on behalf of themselves and other low income minorities living in Toledo, and who allegedly are in need of housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were the City of Toledo, its Mayor, and the individual members of its Plan Commission and City Council.  Skillken and TMHA were each represented by their own attorneys.  Maldonado and Talley were represented by the attorneys of Advocates for Basic Legal Equality and the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.  The municipal defendants were represented by the Director of Law of the City and his assistants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City had entered into a co-operation agreement with TMHA on August 12, 1968.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> TMHA sought and received a reservation of funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the construction of 150 units of single-family low-income housing units under the Turnkey III Program.  TMHA thereafter advertised for proposals on the 150 units.  Skillken responded to the advertisement by submitting to TMHA a proposal for the construction of 140 units of single-family housing.  The proposal was accepted and a letter designating Skillken as the Turnkey III developer was issued by the Director of TMHA.  Under the Turnkey III Program the developer is responsible for securing sites and obtaining all necessary zoning and platting approvals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discussions among Skillken, TMHA, and staff members of the Plan Commission, three sites were chosen upon which to construct the proposed public housing units.  Skillken then entered into option contracts for the acquisition of real property to build as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">50 units of public housing on the Heatherdowns Boulevard site (hereinafter Heatherdowns);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 units of public housing on the Holland-Sylvania site (Holland-Sylvania); and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 units of public housing on the Stateline Road-Lewis Avenue site (Stateline).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December, 1973 Skillken requested approval from the Plan Commission for the preliminary platting of the three proposed sites.  Simultaneously Skillken petitioned the Plan Commission for a rezoning of the Heatherdowns site from an R--A residential classification of 20,000-square foot lots to an R--2 residential classification of 6,000-square foot lots, which would permit construction of fifty single-family low income housing units on lots of much smaller dimension than authorized by existing zoning.  Zoning changes were not required for the Holland-Sylvania or Stateline sites, since existing zoning accommodated the proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 1974 the Plan Commission's staff conditionally recommended, and the Plan Commission accepted, the preliminary plat for the Holland-Sylvania site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> During this meeting consideration was given to the preliminary platting of the Stateline site, but action was deferred until February 7, 1974 when the Plan Commission met to consider the preliminary platting of the Stateline and Heatherdowns sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Residents from these areas attended the meeting and voiced strong disapproval of the construction of public housing units because of the potential water drainage problems that higher density dwelling units would cause.  Additional objections will be discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan Commission deferred action until its March 7, 1974 meeting, at which time it rejected Skillken's petition for the platting of the Stateline site on the basis that '(i)t is not in the best interests of the residents in that area . . .' The Plan Commission also rejected the petition for platting and the request to rezone the Heatherdowns site for the reason that '(t)he subdivision as presented . . . does not meet the area requirements for the zoning. . . .'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this action by the Plan Commission the Toledo City Council preliminarily denied Skillken's request to rezone the Heatherdowns site on March 19, 1974.  On March 21, 1974 the Plan Commission rescinded its prior approval for the Holland-Sylvania site, and on March 26, 1974 the Council formally rejected Skillken's request for rezoning the Heatherdowns site by passage of Resolution 1--74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1974 the plaintiffs filed the present suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They sought a mandatory injunction to compel the members of the City Council of Toledo to rezone and plat the Heatherdowns site and to approve a plat for the Holland-Sylvania and Stateline sites so as to permit the construction of 130 low cost public housing units on said sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was alleged that the action of the City Council and the Plan Commission was racially motivated by intentional and purposeful discrimination against black people who were in need of public housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge in his published opinion found a purposeful and intentional discrimination against black people on the part of the City Council and the Plan Commission, and directed counsel for plaintiffs to prepare an order granting relief to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order, which was approved by the Court and entered on October 8, 1974, however, substantially deviated from the Court's published opinion.  It provided that the defendants' acts--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>. . . without any regard to the defendants' intentions or motivations, are and have the effect of being racially discriminatory, of perpetuating racial residential segregation and that these actions deny plaintiffs and the members of their class equal housing opportunities. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, 'in effect' discrimination was added, whereas the previous ground was purposeful and intentional discrimination, which was not proved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this was not all.  The entire nature of the case was changed by the following order (which was not in the published opinion):</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>AND IT IS FURTHER</p>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>ORDERED that in order to eliminate the past and continuing effects of racial residential segregation, the defendants shall, after consultation with plaintiffs, submit to this Court within ninety (90) days after the entry of this order, a comprehensive plan whereby the defendant City of Toledo and Toledo City Plan Commission, their members, officers, agents, employees, and all persons acting in concert and participation with them, shall affirmatively engage themselves in substantial efforts to eliminate discriminatory barriers in the total housing supply and make housing in a broad choice of neighborhoods freely and fully available to minority persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>AND IT IS FURTHER</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>ORDERED that following defendants' submission to the Court of the above plan, plaintiffs may submit to the Court within twenty (20) days thereafter any objections or alternative suggestions to such plan.  (A. 64--65)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These provisions were patterned after orders in school desegregation cases.  They actually ordered integration of the residential neighborhoods of the entire city of Toledo, by means of low cost public housing, at public expense, and irrespective of zoning ordinances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>* THE ATTEMPTED INTERVENTION APPEAL No. 74--2116</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As before stated, the motion to intervene was filed within three days after the answer to the complaint was filed by the municipal defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion was filed by four individual property owners and by the Ragan Woods Homeowners Association, representing about 140 owners of property in the Ragan Woods Subdivision, who are members of this class.  The motion stated that there are questions of law and fact common to the class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common question of law and fact is the propriety of the actions of the municipal defendants in disapproving the requested rezoning and plat proposals for the Heatherdowns site referred to in the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion further stated that as neighboring property owners they would be damaged by the proposed zoning change and that they have rights and interests protected by statute and are entitled to intervene as a matter of right.  They state that disposition of the present suit may impair or impede their ability to protect their interests.  They also assert that they have a permissive right to intervene as shown by their proposed answer to the complaint, a copy of which was attached to the motion to intervene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their answer the intervenors state among other things that the Heatherdowns Boulevard site was zoned R--A for single-family residences, with minimum lot areas per family of 20,000-square feet and minimum lot width of 100 feet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is alleged that this zoning was proper and conformed to the most desirable, appropriate, and best use of the property affected thereby at the time it was zoned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They allege that the individual property owners and the class they represent have expended over $10,000,000 in development of their respective properties in reliance on the existing zoning ordinances, and since said zoning there has been no zoning change of any part of the Ragan Woods-Heatherdowns area to R--2, 6,000-square foot lots, as requested by plaintiffs and denied by the co-defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They allege that the proposed zoning change would constitute 'spot zoning', and that as a result the intervenors and others will suffer great deterioration and diminution in value of their respective properties, and that they will be irreparably damaged, for which they have no adequate remedy at law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the District Judge summarily denied the motion to intervene without a hearing and without taking evidence, we must assume that the factual allegations in the motion and in the accompanying answer are true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intervention as of right is governed by Rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>(a) Intervention of Right.  Upon timely application anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the United States confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action and he is so situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our opinion the District Judge erred in ruling that the application to intervene was untimely.  It was filed within only three days after the municipal defendants had answered.  Discovery had just been started.  Counsel for the intervening petitioners had indicated that he would not ask for any delay in the expedited trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wolpe v. Poretsky, 79 U.S.App.D.C. 141, 144 F.2d 505 (1944), intervention was permitted even after judgment in order to permit an adjoining property owner to appeal in a suit brought to enjoin enforcement of a zoning order which affected the value of adjoining property, and the Zoning Commission had decided not to appeal from an adverse judgment of the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that without permitting the neighboring property owners to intervene and protect their property rights, the District Judge in his Memorandum Opinion commented on their conduct, as well as that of the public officials who are the defendants, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>The records of the hearings before the Commission and the Council are a sad display of bigotry, intolerance, and selfishness at its worst.  With a great, but totally hypocritical, show of piety, public officials and neighboring property owners pretended that to develop groups of dwellings would only create new ghettoes and that acceptable minority housing can only be obtained by building or buying individual houses throughout the city, or better still, by going out into the suburbs or rural areas beyond the city.  The evidence in this case leaves no doubt that the actions and attitudes which have created segregation in Toledo are so strong and so persistent that only very positive court action can change the present housing patterns.  (380 F.Supp. at 231)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus the Mayor of Toledo, the members of the City Council and the Plan Commission are all tarred with 'bigotry, intolerance, and selfishness at its worst.'  The public officials and the neighboring property owners who were attempting to protect their properties from serious diminution in value were branded as hypocrites feigning a show of piety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 24(a) requires that the applicant claim an interest relating to the property or transaction which is the subject of the action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The change in zoning was from lots of 20,000 square feet with 100 feet frontage, to lots of only 6,000 square feet.  This would permit the construction of fifty low cost homes in a neighborhood where homes costing from $75,000 to $100,000 have been built.  The motion to intervene alleges facts which have not been contradicted that the change in the zoning law will result in a serious and substantial diminution of value of the properties in the Ragan Woods Subdivision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look to the law of Ohio for guidance as to the rights of property owners who have purchased and developed their properties relying on existing zoning ordinances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Revised Code of Ohio &#167; 713.13 provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>No person shall erect, construct, alter, repair, or maintain any building or structure or use any land in violation of any zoning ordinance or regulation enacted pursuant to sections 713.06 to 713.12, inclusive, of the Revised Code, or Section 3 of Article XVIII, Ohio Constitution.  In the event of any such violation, or imminent threat thereof, the municipal corporation, or the owner of any contiguous or neighboring property who would be especially damaged by such violation, in addition to any other remedies provided by law, may institute a suit for injunction to prevent or terminate such violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It will be noted that this statute grants to contiguous or neighboring property owners the right to institute a suit for injunction to prevent not only a violation but also a threatened violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present suit in the District Court was not only a threatened violation but also it has actually resulted in a nullification of the zoning ordinance on which the property owners relied in the purchase and development of their properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even prior to the enactment of Revised Code of Ohio &#167; 713.13 the Ohio courts had upheld the right of a property owner to bring a suit to enjoin the erection of a structure in violation of a zoning ordinance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Pritz v.

It seems clear that a judgment which declares a zoning order to be void would bind adjoining property owners to the extent of taking away their statutory right to an independent action based on the order.  Otherwise, adjoining property owners could relitigate the issues in the case any time the plaintiff began construction, on the theory that their right to bring an independent action was not concluded by the decree.

City of Cleveland, 426 F.2d 955 (6th Cir. 1970), is misplaced.  In Woodland property was condemned for urban renewal and a company owning a leasehold interest in the neighborhood claimed to be damaged because its customers had been removed.

As we will point out later, neither did the District Judge, in attempting to exercise legislative functions, have any such right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Toledo is a municipal corporation with Home Rule Powers of self-government conferred on it by Article XVIII &#167; 3 of the Constitution of Ohio.

Property owners from the areas of all of the three projects attended en masse and vigorously protested.  They were all permitted to be heard.  Skillken's attorney also attended and presented his views in favor of the platting and the rezoning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No representative of TMHA appeared at any of the hearings before the Plan Commission or the City Council to support the rezoning and the platting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property owners voiced their objection to all three projects on the ground that the projects would seriously depreciate the value of their homes.  Objection to the Stateline Road project was made also on the grounds of poor soil conditions and flooding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Plan Commission disapproved of the preliminary platting of the two projects.

Chairman Cooke is a Negro.  The action of the Commission was by a unanimous vote.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These reasons were substantially as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1-- The TMHA projects in recent years had been a dismal failure.  Projects had been started and were not completed.  Projects which had been completed were unoccupied.  Evidence of these facts was proffered when the Court rejected it as irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2-- The clustering of forty to fifty units of low-income housing was not the proper approach for the entire city as it created an isolated neighborhood within a neighborhood.  The Commission suggested that developers be required to include some low-income homes in each new development.  They also suggested an extension of TMHA's leased housing project and the building of public housing on scattered individual sites to distribute low-income housing throughout Toledo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3-- TMHA has neglected to meet with residents in the area of the proposed projects to explain their virtues and to endeavor to overcome any resistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4-- The proposed projects would not produce orderly development of the land to obtain harmonious and stable neighborhoods, and were not in the best interests of the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5-- There was doubt about the adequacy of the Stateline site based on reports of neighbors as to past flooding and landfill problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these matters were required to be considered by the members of the Plan Commission and the City Council in the performance of their duty.  None of them has any racial overtones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also significant that neither Skillken or TMHA endeavored to meet with either the Plan Commission or the City Council after the rejection to work out a better and more acceptable plan for public housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the District Judge passed upon evidence considered by the Plan Commission and the City Council, but he reached a different conclusion.  The trouble is that he was not a member of either body, and further, he had no appellate jurisdiction to review their decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge held that Resolution 1--74 enacted by City Council, denying rezoning of the Heatherdowns tract, was illegal and void.  For the reason stated in this opinion was disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But assuming that Resolution 1--74, denying rezoning, was invalid, it would follow that the valid existing zoning ordinance requiring 20,000-square foot lots with 100-foot frontage, would remain in full force and effect.  This result, however, did not bother the District Judge.  He simply ordered the City Council to pass another ordinance to rezone the tract to 9,000-square foot lots.  The figure of 9,000 square feet was used rather than the figure of 6,000, contained in the written petition for rezoning, because counsel for Skillken had indicated that the higher figure was acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that in ordering the members of the City Council to pass a new zoning ordinance, the District Judge was exercising legislative powers which he did not possess.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We commented on this in Mahaley v.

To do so would constitute encroachment upon the functions of a legislative body and would violate the time-honored principle of separation of powers of the three great departments of our Government.  This principle is equally applicable to the power of a Federal Judge to order a state legislative body to enact legislation.  The enactment of legislation is not a ministerial function subject to control by mandamus, prohibition or the injunctive powers of a court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Toledo's population in 1970 was 329,068, of whom 86% were white, 14% were black, and 1% other minority groups. 28% of the population, or 35,000 households, were eligible for public housing; 21% of those eligible were black, and 79% were white.

Low cost public housing could move into the most exclusive neighborhoods in the metropolitan area and property values would be slaughtered.  Innocent people who labored hard all of their lives and saved their money to purchase homes in nice residential neighborhoods, and who never discriminated against anyone, would be faced with a total change in their neighborhoods, with the values of their properties slashed.  All of this would be accomplished simply by an order of a Federal Judge, and at the expense of the taxpayers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is submitted that Congress never vested any such power in Federal Judges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Members of the City Council did not cause nor create the concentration of black people in Toledo, and they are under no legal obligation to deconcentrate the area or to change the zoning laws to bring about deconcentration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are the city officials responsible for private discrimination, most of which, we believe, occurred prior to Ohio's Civil Rights Act, Ohio Rev.Code &#167; 4112.01 et seq., and the decision of the Supreme Court in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968), which afford adequate remedies for private racial discrimination in housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was argued that housing units were constructed in Toledo in the areas of racial concentration.  It should be remembered that ever since the 1968 co- operation agreement the location of housing units was the sole province of TMHA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we regard the refusal of the City Council to rezone and the Plan Commission to replat, as obstructing the rights of minorities to housing, upon which an inference of discrimination 'in effect' may be drawn against those bodies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can the city officials be blamed for the substandard public housing already constructed by TMHA, or for TMHA's failure to complete existing projects, or for TMHA's permitting projects to remain vacant or in a state of disrepair, as was described in proof which was excluded by the District Court but was duly proffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We live in a free society.  The time has not yet arrived for the courts to strike down state zoning laws which are neutral on their face and valid when passed, in order to permit the construction at public expense of large numbers of low cost public housing units in a neighborhood where they do not belong, and where the property owners, relying on the zoning laws, have spent large sums of money to build fine homes for the enjoyment of their families.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal court ought not to exercise state legislative functions.

Forest City Enterprises, Inc. v. Eastlake, supra; 10 Ohio Jur.2d, Constitutional Law, &#167;&#167; 239, 315.  In Forest City the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p>In Ohio, the power to zone or rezone, via the passage or amendment of a comprehensive zoning ordinance, is clearly a legislative function.

Struthers, 176 Ohio St. 146, 198 N.E.2d 48 (1964); Tuber v. Perkins, 6 Ohio St.2d 155, 216 N.E.2d 877 (1966); Donnelly v.

It would not have been necessary for Skillken to do this if the cooperation agreement validly waived the zoning laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact is that over the years from 1938 the City did furnish police and fire protection and other services required by the cooperation agreement.  It would appear that the only violation claimed by the plaintiffs was that the city did not change its zoning laws and approve preliminary platting, in the present case.  It was not required to make such changes unless lawfully approved by the governing body of the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for dismissal of the complaint with respect to the rezoning and platting of Heatherdowns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the platting of Holland-Sylvania and Stateline sites the cause is remanded for further consideration by the District Court after the parties have endeavored to work out an amicable solution of their problems which include scattered housing sites and housing in new developments, and consideration of the rights of the property owners in the two areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each party will pay his own costs in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PHILLIPS, Chief Judge (concurring in the result).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur in the results reached in the opinion prepared by Judge Weick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My opinion is that the record contains no support for the District Court's statement that the actions of the City Council and the Plan Commission were a 'sad display of bigotry, intolerance, and selfishness at its worst.' 380 F.Supp. at 231.  Not only is this finding clearly erroneous, but it is also likely to be counterproductive in the sensitive and controversial circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also agree that the record of this case does not provide a basis for the action of the District Court in ordering that the City of Toledo submit a comprehensive plan for the elimination of all discriminatory barriers in housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this court said in Garrett v. City of Hamtramck, 503 F.2d 1236, 1249 (6th Cir. 1974), affirmative provisions in a decree 'should be no greater than required because courts are ill-equipped to administer the details of a municipality's affairs.'  In my opinion the requirement that Toledo develop a sweeping plan of affirmative action is unnecessary in this case.  More important, it would deeply involve the District Court in complex and delicate problems of city planning that are best left to the municipal government and to the various administrative agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal No. 74--2116 is from the decision of the District Court denying the petition of Ragan Woods Homeowners Association, et al., to intervene as parties defendant.  I agree that these parties had a right to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a) and that the District Court committed reversible error in denying leave to intervene under the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I interpret the opinion prepared by Judge Weick to make final disposition of only one issue--the rezoning of the Heatherdowns tract.  I agree that the decision of the District Court should be reversed on this issue and that the complaint should be dismissed insofar as it seeks the rezoning and platting of Heatherdowns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I further agree that the issues of platting the Holland-Sylvania and Stateline sites should be remanded for further consideration after the parties have endeavored to work out an amicable solution to their problems.  All the parties to this appeal are, or should be, interested in the development of the City of Toledo, where all citizens, black and white, will have equal opportunities for adequate housing, without discrimination.  The parties are, or should be, interested in avoiding a situation for Toledo such as is described in United States v. City of Black Jack, Missouri, 508 F.2d 1179 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1042, 95 S.Ct. 2656, 45 L.Ed.2d 694 (1975).  These are problems that should be resolved effectively by persons of good will, working at the level of local government, and not by mandates of federal courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If parties are not successful in working out an amicable settlement of their differences, the District Court will have another opportunity to pass upon the issues in the light of all evidence then on file, including the evidence heard on remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> The Honorable Wendell A.

The record does not disclose any question about the solvency of the City or its ability to respond in damages.  It is not understandable, in any event, why such a high bond was required.

The mandatory injunction also required the defendants to approve a preliminary plat for that area, and for two other areas of the city, all to accommodate the construction of one hundred forty-five Turnkey III low cost public housing units in said areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They further involve the propriety of the order of the District Court, not considered in its published opinion, requiring the City Council to submit to the Court, within 90 days, a comprehensive plan for the integration of the residential neighborhoods of the City of Toledo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The property owners in the Ragan Woods Addition filed a motion to intervene as defendants in the suit against the municipal defendants, on the ground that to change the existing comprehensive zoning ordinance to accommodate the construction of low cost housing would depreciate substantially the values of their properties.  The motion to intervene, together with a proposed answer to the complaint, was promptly filed within three days after the municipal defendants had filed their answers to the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge summarily denied the motion without even a hearing, the grounds for denial being that it was untimely filed, that the property owners did not have sufficient interest, and that they were adequately represented by counsel for the municipal defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeals were taken to this Court by the property owners who were denied intervention in case number 74--2116, and by the municipal defendants in case number 74--2320.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The municipal defendants moved for a stay of the District Court's mandatory injunction pending appeal, which stay was granted by the District Court, but only on condition that the City of Toledo execute a supersedeas bond in the amount of $880,709.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The City promptly posted the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs in the case were Joseph Skillken &amp; Company (Skillken), a Columbus, Ohio corporation, engaged in the development and construction of residential housing units, Toledo Metropolitan Housing Authority (TMHA), Jose Maldonado and Barbara Talley, a Mexican American and a Negro, on behalf of themselves and other low income minorities living in Toledo, and who allegedly are in need of housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants were the City of Toledo, its Mayor, and the individual members of its Plan Commission and City Council.  Skillken and TMHA were each represented by their own attorneys.  Maldonado and Talley were represented by the attorneys of Advocates for Basic Legal Equality and the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing.  The municipal defendants were represented by the Director of Law of the City and his assistants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City had entered into a co-operation agreement with TMHA on August 12, 1968.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> TMHA sought and received a reservation of funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the construction of 150 units of single-family low-income housing units under the Turnkey III Program.  TMHA thereafter advertised for proposals on the 150 units.  Skillken responded to the advertisement by submitting to TMHA a proposal for the construction of 140 units of single-family housing.  The proposal was accepted and a letter designating Skillken as the Turnkey III developer was issued by the Director of TMHA.  Under the Turnkey III Program the developer is responsible for securing sites and obtaining all necessary zoning and platting approvals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discussions among Skillken, TMHA, and staff members of the Plan Commission, three sites were chosen upon which to construct the proposed public housing units.  Skillken then entered into option contracts for the acquisition of real property to build as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">50 units of public housing on the Heatherdowns Boulevard site (hereinafter Heatherdowns);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">46 units of public housing on the Holland-Sylvania site (Holland-Sylvania); and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">34 units of public housing on the Stateline Road-Lewis Avenue site (Stateline).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December, 1973 Skillken requested approval from the Plan Commission for the preliminary platting of the three proposed sites.  Simultaneously Skillken petitioned the Plan Commission for a rezoning of the Heatherdowns site from an R--A residential classification of 20,000-square foot lots to an R--2 residential classification of 6,000-square foot lots, which would permit construction of fifty single-family low income housing units on lots of much smaller dimension than authorized by existing zoning.  Zoning changes were not required for the Holland-Sylvania or Stateline sites, since existing zoning accommodated the proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 1974 the Plan Commission's staff conditionally recommended, and the Plan Commission accepted, the preliminary plat for the Holland-Sylvania site.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> During this meeting consideration was given to the preliminary platting of the Stateline site, but action was deferred until February 7, 1974 when the Plan Commission met to consider the preliminary platting of the Stateline and Heatherdowns sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Residents from these areas attended the meeting and voiced strong disapproval of the construction of public housing units because of the potential water drainage problems that higher density dwelling units would cause.

The Plan Commission also rejected the petition for platting and the request to rezone the Heatherdowns site for the reason that '(t)he subdivision as presented . . . does not meet the area requirements for the zoning. . . .'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following this action by the Plan Commission the Toledo City Council preliminarily denied Skillken's request to rezone the Heatherdowns site on March 19, 1974.  On March 21, 1974 the Plan Commission rescinded its prior approval for the Holland-Sylvania site, and on March 26, 1974 the Council formally rejected Skillken's request for rezoning the Heatherdowns site by passage of Resolution 1--74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1974 the plaintiffs filed the present suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They sought a mandatory injunction to compel the members of the City Council of Toledo to rezone and plat the Heatherdowns site and to approve a plat for the Holland-Sylvania and Stateline sites so as to permit the construction of 130 low cost public housing units on said sites.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was alleged that the action of the City Council and the Plan Commission was racially motivated by intentional and purposeful discrimination against black people who were in need of public housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge in his published opinion found a purposeful and intentional discrimination against black people on the part of the City Council and the Plan Commission, and directed counsel for plaintiffs to prepare an order granting relief to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order, which was approved by the Court and entered on October 8, 1974, however, substantially deviated from the Court's published opinion.

It seems clear that a judgment which declares a zoning order to be void would bind adjoining property owners to the extent of taking away their statutory right to an independent action based on the order.  Otherwise, adjoining property owners could relitigate the issues in the case any time the plaintiff began construction, on the theory that their right to bring an independent action was not concluded by the decree.

Projects had been started and were not completed.  Projects which had been completed were unoccupied.  Evidence of these facts was proffered when the Court rejected it as irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2-- The clustering of forty to fifty units of low-income housing was not the proper approach for the entire city as it created an isolated neighborhood within a neighborhood.  The Commission suggested that developers be required to include some low-income homes in each new development.  They also suggested an extension of TMHA's leased housing project and the building of public housing on scattered individual sites to distribute low-income housing throughout Toledo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3-- TMHA has neglected to meet with residents in the area of the proposed projects to explain their virtues and to endeavor to overcome any resistance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4-- The proposed projects would not produce orderly development of the land to obtain harmonious and stable neighborhoods, and were not in the best interests of the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5-- There was doubt about the adequacy of the Stateline site based on reports of neighbors as to past flooding and landfill problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of these matters were required to be considered by the members of the Plan Commission and the City Council in the performance of their duty.  None of them has any racial overtones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also significant that neither Skillken or TMHA endeavored to meet with either the Plan Commission or the City Council after the rejection to work out a better and more acceptable plan for public housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that the District Judge passed upon evidence considered by the Plan Commission and the City Council, but he reached a different conclusion.  The trouble is that he was not a member of either body, and further, he had no appellate jurisdiction to review their decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Judge held that Resolution 1--74 enacted by City Council, denying rezoning of the Heatherdowns tract, was illegal and void.

This result, however, did not bother the District Judge.  He simply ordered the City Council to pass another ordinance to rezone the tract to 9,000-square foot lots.  The figure of 9,000 square feet was used rather than the figure of 6,000, contained in the written petition for rezoning, because counsel for Skillken had indicated that the higher figure was acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that in ordering the members of the City Council to pass a new zoning ordinance, the District Judge was exercising legislative powers which he did not possess.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We commented on this in Mahaley v.

It would appear that the only violation claimed by the plaintiffs was that the city did not change its zoning laws and approve preliminary platting, in the present case.  It was not required to make such changes unless lawfully approved by the governing body of the city.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for dismissal of the complaint with respect to the rezoning and platting of Heatherdowns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the platting of Holland-Sylvania and Stateline sites the cause is remanded for further consideration by the District Court after the parties have endeavored to work out an amicable solution of their problems which include scattered housing sites and housing in new developments, and consideration of the rights of the property owners in the two areas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each party will pay his own costs in this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PHILLIPS, Chief Judge (concurring in the result).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I concur in the results reached in the opinion prepared by Judge Weick.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My opinion is that the record contains no support for the District Court's statement that the actions of the City Council and the Plan Commission were a 'sad display of bigotry, intolerance, and selfishness at its worst.' 380 F.Supp. at 231.  Not only is this finding clearly erroneous, but it is also likely to be counterproductive in the sensitive and controversial circumstances of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also agree that the record of this case does not provide a basis for the action of the District Court in ordering that the City of Toledo submit a comprehensive plan for the elimination of all discriminatory barriers in housing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this court said in Garrett v.

In my opinion the requirement that Toledo develop a sweeping plan of affirmative action is unnecessary in this case.  More important, it would deeply involve the District Court in complex and delicate problems of city planning that are best left to the municipal government and to the various administrative agencies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appeal No. 74--2116 is from the decision of the District Court denying the petition of Ragan Woods Homeowners Association, et al., to intervene as parties defendant.

All the parties to this appeal are, or should be, interested in the development of the City of Toledo, where all citizens, black and white, will have equal opportunities for adequate housing, without discrimination.

The record does not disclose any question about the solvency of the City or its ability to respond in damages.  It is not understandable, in any event, why such a high bond was required.
