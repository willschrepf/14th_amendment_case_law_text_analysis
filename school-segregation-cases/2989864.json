Defendant was sentenced, as a\nsecond habitual offender, MCL 769.10, to 119 days, time served, for the felonious assault\nconviction and 93 days, time served, for the domestic violence conviction. Defendant was also\nrequired to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), MCL\n28.721et seq. We affirm.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Defendant was convicted in 1990 of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual\nconduct involving penetration, MCL 750.520g(1). He was sentenced to three years’ probation\nand was discharged in 1993. On October 1, 1995, SORA went into effect. Although assault\nwith intent to commit criminal sexual conduct involving penetration is a “listed offense”\nrequiring registration, MCL 28.722(w)(iv), defendant was not required to register because he was\ndischarged from probation before the registry went into effect, MCL 28.723(1). In 2011, the\nLegislature amended SORA, 2011 PA 17, to include the following “recapture” provision,\ncodified at MCL 28.723(1)(e):\n\n\n\n\n1\n See People v Tucker, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered July 3, 2014 (Docket\nNo. 322151).\n\n\n                                              -1-\n\f                 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the following individuals who are domiciled\n         or temporarily reside in this state or who work with or without compensation or\n         are students in this state are required to be registered under this act:\n\n                                              * * *\n\n                (e) An individual who was previously convicted of a listed offense for\n         which he or she was not required to register under this act, but who is convicted\n         of any other felony on or after July 1, 2011.\n\n        On October 8, 2013, defendant pleaded no contest to felonious assault, MCL 750.82, and\ndomestic violence, MCL 750.81(2), under a Cobbs2 agreement under which he would be\nsentenced to time served. At sentencing, the trial court told defendant that he would be required\nto register as a sex offender under MCL 28.723(1)(e)3 and gave defendant the opportunity to\nwithdraw his plea. Defendant declined. Defendant was required to register for life as a “Tier\nIII” offender.\n\n        Defendant then filed a motion to correct an invalid sentence in order for the trial court to\nremove him from the SORA registry, arguing that the registration requirement violated the state\nand federal Ex Post Facto Clauses, the federal Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, and the\nstate Cruel or Unusual Punishment Clause. The trial court denied the motion and determined\nthat defendant was required to register under the terms of the law.\n\n                                 II. EX POST FACTO CLAUSES\n\n     Defendant first contends that the requirement that he register as a sex offender under\nSORA violates the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. We disagree.\n\n         We review de novo issues of constitutional law. People v Temelkoski, 307 Mich App\n241, 246; 859 NW2d 743 (2014). The United States and Michigan Constitutions prohibit ex post\nfacto laws. People v Callon, 256 Mich App 312, 316-317; 662 NW2d 501 (2003), citing US\nConst, art 1, § 10; Const 1963, art 1, § 10. This Court has declined to interpret the Ex Post Facto\nClause of the Michigan Constitution to afford broader protection than its federal counterpart. Id.\nat 317. All laws that violate ex post facto protections exhibit the same two elements: “(1) they\nattach legal consequences to acts before their effective date, and (2) they work to the\ndisadvantage of the defendant.” Id. at 318. “The critical question [for an ex post facto violation]\nis whether the law changes the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.”\nId. (citations and quotation marks omitted; alteration in Callon; emphasis omitted). This Court\nhas identified four circumstances that implicate the Ex Post Facto Clauses:\n\n\n\n2\n    People v Cobbs, 443 Mich 276; 505 NW2d 208 (1993).\n3\n  Defendant was required to register under MCL 28.723(1)(e) because of his felonious assault\nconviction, which is a felony. See MCL 750.82(1). His domestic violence conviction is a\nmisdemeanor conviction. MCL 750.81(2).\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f       A statute that affects the prosecution or disposition of criminal cases involving\n       crimes committed before the effective date of the statute violates the Ex Post\n       Facto Clauses if it (1) makes punishable that which was not, (2) makes an act a\n       more serious criminal offense, (3) increases the punishment, or (4) allows the\n       prosecution to convict on less evidence. [Riley v Parole Bd, 216 Mich App 242,\n       244; 548 NW2d 686 (1996).]\n\nIn this case, the third circumstance is at issue, as defendant argues that his registration as a sex\noffender has increased the punishment for his 1990 conviction. Plaintiff counters that MCL\n28.723(1)(e) cannot constitute an ex post facto law because it attaches legal consequences to\ndefendant’s 2013 convictions, not his 1990 conviction.\n\n        We find caselaw on recidivist statutes helpful in answering this question. As a general\nmatter, “ ‘recidivist statutes . . . do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction.’ ”\nPeople v Reichenbach, 459 Mich 109, 124-225; 587 NW2d 1 (1998), quoting Nichols v United\nStates, 511 US 738, 747; 114 S Ct 1921; 128 L Ed 2d 745 (1994). Callon is instructive in this\nregard. The defendant in Callon was convicted of impaired driving, MCL 257.625(3), in 1993.\nCallon, 256 Mich App at 315. On October 9, 1999, he was arrested for operating a vehicle under\nthe influence of intoxicating liquors or while having a blood alcohol content of 0.10 grams or\nmore per 100 milliliters of blood (OUIL/UBAL), MCL 257.625(1). Id. at 314. During the\nperiod between the two offenses, the Legislature amended the pertinent statute so that a previous\nimpaired-driving conviction could be used to enhance a subsequent OUIL/UBAL conviction. Id.\nat 315-316. This Court rejected the defendant’s ex post facto challenge to this enhancement,\nholding that the amendment to the statute had not altered the legal consequences of his 1993\nconviction, but rather altered the legal consequences of his 1999 conviction. Id. at 318. This\nCourt explained, “[T]he conduct for which defendant is being punished is driving while\nintoxicated or with an unlawful blood alcohol level after having fair notice that the statute had\nbeen amended to permit enhancement of an OUIL/UBAL conviction with a prior impaired-\ndriving conviction.” Id. at 319. This Court concluded, “Simply put, there is no retroactive\napplication of the law where a prior conviction is used to enhance the penalty for a new offense\ncommitted after the effective date of the statute.” Id. at 321.\n\n        In this case, although MCL 28.723(1)(e) is not a traditional recidivist statute, the\nreasoning of Callon applies nonetheless. Defendant’s registration was not required until he\ncommitted another felony in 2013. His 1990 conviction was used to enhance the consequences\nof his 2013 felony, which was committed after the effective date of the statute. This would be a\ndifferent case if on July 1, 2011, the effective date of MCL 28.723(1)(e), defendant had been\nimmediately required to register as a sex offender because of his 1990 conviction alone. Rather,\ndefendant is required to register in connection with the 2013 felony. Defendant’s registration in\nthis case is inextricably tied to his 1990 conviction. But this does not lead to the conclusion that\nnew legal consequences have been added to that conviction. In Callon, the enhancement was\nsimilarly tied to the defendant’s preceding impaired-driving conviction, but the consequences\nwere added to his subsequent OUIL/UBAL offense. See Callon, 256 Mich App at 319.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fTherefore, the recapture provision found in MCL 28.723(1)(e) does not violate the Ex Post Facto\nClauses of the state and federal Constitutions.4\n\n                          III. CRUEL OR UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\n\n       Defendant next argues that requiring him to register as a sex offender constitutes cruel or\nunusual punishment. We disagree.\n\n       As stated above, we review de novo issues of constitutional law. Temelkoski, 307 Mich\nApp at 246. Defendant, as the party challenging SORA, bears the burden of proving that it is\nunconstitutional. Id. at 247.\n\n       Article I, § 16 of the Michigan Constitution prohibits the infliction of cruel or unusual\npunishment.5 A threshold question in this case, of course, is whether registration constitutes\npunishment at all. See Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 250-251. We have repeatedly held that sex\noffender registration does not constitute punishment because the registry is designed to protect\nthe public rather than punish the offender. Id. at 250-271; People v Golba, 273 Mich App 603,\n615-621; 729 NW2d 916 (2007); People v Pennington, 240 Mich App 188, 191-197; 610 NW2d\n608 (2000).6 But defendant posits an argument that we have not yet addressed. He argues that in\n\n\n4\n  Amicus argues that defendant’s registration as a sex offender violates the Ex Post Facto\nClauses as applied to him. However, the United States Supreme Court has held that ex post facto\nchallenges cannot be brought on an as-applied basis. Seling v Young, 531 US 250, 263; 121 S Ct\n727; 148 L Ed 2d 734 (2001). Therefore, we reject amicus’s argument.\n5\n  The Eight Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the infliction of cruel and\nunusual punishment. US Const, Am VIII. The state constitutional provision is interpreted more\nbroadly than the federal provision, and therefore if a particular punishment “passes muster under\nthe state constitution, then it necessarily passes muster under the federal constitution.” People v\nNunez, 242 Mich App 610, 618 n 2; 619 NW2d 550 (2000).\n6\n  One exception was People v Dipiazza, 286 Mich App 137; 778 NW2d 264 (2009). In that case,\nthe defendant, aged 18, had a consensual sexual relationship with NT, “who was nearly 15 years\nold.” Id. at 140. NT’s parents “knew of the relationship and condoned it.” Id. at 154. The\ndefendant and NT subsequently married. Id. The defendant pleaded guilty to attempted third-\ndegree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.92; MCL 750.520d(1)(a), and was placed on youthful\ntrainee status under the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act (HYTA), MCL 762.11 et seq., on August\n29, 2004. Id. at 140. Under SORA as it existed at that time, the defendant was required to\nregister as a sex offender. Id. However, under amendments to SORA that went into effect on\nOctober 1, 2004, if the defendant had been placed on HYTA status on or after October 1, he\nwould not have been required to register as a sex offender. Id. at 141. The defendant was\nsuccessfully discharged from HYTA status and petitioned to be removed from the sex offender\nregistry. Id. at 140. This Court held that the defendant’s registration as a sex offender\nconstituted cruel or unusual punishment as applied to him. Id. at 156. In 2011, however, SORA\nwas amended to include “a consent exception . . . that provides some youthful offenders relief in\nsituations involving consensual sex acts.” Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 261. The Temelkoski\n\n                                                -4-\n\flight of recent amendments that have added to the requirements of sex offender registration, it\nnow constitutes punishment. He specifically draws our attention to school safety zones and in-\nperson reporting requirements. We take this opportunity to address the constitutionality of these\nprovisions.\n\n                                     A. HISTORY OF SORA\n\n       SORA first went into effect on October 1, 1995. People v Dipiazza, 286 Mich App 137,\n142; 778 NW2d 264 (2009). It has been amended 20 times since. See 2014 PA 328; 2013 PA 2;\n2013 PA 149; 2011 PA 18; 2011 PA 17; 2006 PA 46; 2006 PA 402; 2005 PA 121, 2005 PA 123,\n2005 PA 127, 2005 PA 132, 2005 PA 301; 2005 PA 322; 2004 PA 237, 2004 PA 238; 2004 PA\n240; 2002 PA 542; 1999 PA 85; 1996 PA 494; 1995 PA 10.7 These amendments have generally\nmade registration more intrusive and onerous for registrants. Defendant argues that these\nsuccessive amendments have turned what was originally only a law enforcement tool into a\npunishment for the offenders. We do not attempt to catalogue every amendment to SORA but\nonly those that are most relevant to the resolution of the questions before us.\n\n        The sex offender registry as it first existed in 1995 was not public and was accessible\nonly by law enforcement. Dipiazza, 286 Mich App at 142. Offenders were required to register\nfor 25 years for their first offense and for life for a second or subsequent offense committed after\nOctober 1, 1995. MCL 28.725(3) and (4), as enacted by 1994 PA 295. In 1996, limited public\ninspection was allowed. MCL 28.730(2), as added by 1996 PA 494. Police agencies were\nrequired to make registry information for the zip codes within their jurisdiction “available for\npublic inspection during regular business hours.” Id.\n\n        In 1999, the registry became available to the public through the Internet. MCL\n28.728(2), as amended by 1999 PA 85; Dipiazza, 286 Mich App at 142-143. The amendment\nalso added more “listed offenses” requiring registration. MCL 28.722(d), as amended by 1999\nPA 85. Further, a “catch-all” provision was added, which included as a listed offense “[a]n\noffense substantially similar to” a listed offense. MCL 28.722(d)(xiii), as added by 1999 PA 85.\nThe amendment also provided that persons convicted of certain offenses would be required to\nregister for life. MCL 28.725(7), as added by 1999 PA 85. Finally, offenders were now required\nto report in person to verify their domicile or residence. MCL 28.725a, as added by 1999 PA 85.\n\n         In 2002, SORA was amended to require sex offenders who are students or employees at\ninstitutions of higher education to register with the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction\nover the institution’s campus. MCL 28.724a, as added by 2002 PA 542. A registrant’s status as\na student or employee at such an institution became included on the registry. MCL 28.728(3)(b),\n\nCourt held that in light of these amendments, the analysis in Dipiazza was “outdated.” Id. at\n258.\n7\n  Defendant refers in his brief to the “legislative history” of these changes as purportedly\nrecounted in the legislative analyses. But our Supreme Court has stated that such staff-prepared\nanalyses are of little value in interpreting statutes and “[i]n no way can . . . be said to officially\nsummarize the intentions of” the Legislature. In re Certified Question from the United States\nCourt of Appeals for Sixth Circuit, 468 Mich 109, 115 n 5; 659 NW2d 597 (2003).\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fas added by 2002 PA 542. The 2002 amendment also included a statement of legislative\npurpose:\n\n               The legislature declares that the sex offenders registration act was enacted\n       pursuant to the legislature’s exercise of the police power of the state with the\n       intent to better assist law enforcement officers and the people of this state in\n       preventing and protecting against the commission of future criminal sexual acts\n       by convicted sex offenders. The legislature has determined that a person who has\n       been convicted of committing an offense covered by this act poses a potential\n       serious menace and danger to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the\n       people, and particularly the children, of this state. The registration requirements\n       of this act are intended to provide law enforcement and the people of this state\n       with an appropriate, comprehensive, and effective means to monitor those persons\n       who pose such a potential danger. [MCL 28.721a, as added by 2002 PA 542.]\n\n       In 2004, registrants were first required to pay a $35 “registration fee.” MCL 28.725a(6),\nas added by 2004 PA 237. Another 2004 amendment required that photographs of registrants be\nadded to the registry. MCL 28.728(3)(c), as added by 2004 PA 238.\n\n        In 2005, SORA was amended to create “student safety zones,” defined as “the area that\nlies 1,000 feet or less from school property.” MCL 28.733(f), as added by 2005 PA 121.\nOffenders were generally precluded from residing within school safety zones. MCL 28.735(1),\nas added by 2005 PA 121. This preclusion did not apply if the offender was residing within a\nstudent safety zone when the act was enacted into law. MCL 28.735(3)(c), as added by 2005 PA\n121.8 Otherwise, an offender was required to “change his or her residence to a location outside\nthe student safety zone not more than 90 days after he or she is sentenced for the conviction that\ngives rise to the obligation to register.” MCL 28.735(4), as added by 2005 PA 121.\n\n        Another amendment in 2005 precluded offenders from working or loitering within\nstudent safety zones. MCL 28.734, as added by 2005 PA 127. “Loiter” was defined as “to\nremain for a period of time and under circumstances that a reasonable person would determine is\nfor the primary purpose of observing or contacting minors.” MCL 28.733(b), as added by 2005\nPA 121. This subsection likewise did not apply to a sex offender working within student safety\nzones when the act was enacted into law, MCL 28.734(3)(a), as added by 2005 PA 127, or to a\nsex offender “whose place of employment is within a student safety zone solely because a school\nis relocated or is initially established 1,000 feet or less from the individual’s place of\nemployment,” MCL 28.734(3)(b), as added by 2005 PA 127.9 In 2006, the public became\neligible to receive notifications when persons in their zip code were required to register as sex\n\n\n\n8\n This exception did not apply “to an individual who initiates or maintains contact with a minor\nwithin that student safety zone.” MCL 28.735(3)(c), as added by 2005 PA 121.\n9\n  Again, these exceptions did not apply “to an individual who initiates or maintains contact with\na minor within that student safety zone.” MCL 28.734(3)(a) and (b), as added by 2005 PA 127.\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\foffenders or when registered sex offenders moved their residences to that zip code. MCL\n28.730(3), as amended by 2006 PA 46.\n\n         In 2011, SORA underwent what defendant characterizes as a “sweeping overhaul.” The\nrecapture provision was added. MCL 28.723(1)(e), as added by 2011 PA 17. Further, sex\noffenders were classified into three “tiers” according to the offense they were convicted of.\nMCL 28.722(r)-(w), as added by 2011 PA 17. Tier I offenders were required to register for 15\nyears, Tier II offender for 25 years, and Tier III offenders for life. MCL 28.725(10)-(12), as\nadded by 2011 PA 17. Offenders were also now required to report in person when they change\nresidences, change places of employment, discontinue employment, enroll as a student with\ninstitutions of higher education, discontinue such enrollment, change their names, temporarily\nreside at any place other than their residence for more than seven days, establish an e-mail or\ninstant message address or “any other designations used in internet communications or postings,”\npurchase or “begin[] to regularly operate” a vehicle, or discontinue such ownership or operation.\nMCL 28.725(1)(a)-(h), as added by 2011 PA 17.\n\n         In 2013, SORA was amended to require a $50 registration fee upon initial registration\nand each year thereafter, capped at $550. MCL 28.725a(6), as amended by 2013 PA 149.\nFurther, the number of times and months an offender had to report became dependent on the tier\nhe fell into. MCL 28.725a(3), as amended by 2013 PA 149. In the present case, defendant, as a\nTier III offender, must report for the rest of his life four times each year, MCL 28.725a(3)(c), as\nwell as upon the occurrence of any events listed in MCL 28.725(1).\n\n\n\n\n                          B. THE MENDOZA-MARTINEZ FACTORS\n\n        Determining whether a statutory scheme imposes punishments requires a two-step\ninquiry. Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 258. First, the Court must determine whether the\nLegislature intended the statute to be punitive. Id. If the intent was to punish, the inquiry is\ncomplete. Id. But “if the Legislature intended to enact a civil remedy, the court must also\nascertain whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the\nState’s] intention to deem it civil.” Id. (citations and quotation marks omitted; alteration in\nTemelkoski). To do so, the Court looks to the seven factors enunciated in Kennedy v Mendoza-\nMartinez, 372 US 144; 83 S Ct 554; 9 L Ed 2d 644 (1963). Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 259.\nThose factors are as follows:\n\n       “[1] Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, [2]\n       whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, [3] whether it comes\n       into play only on a finding of scienter, [4] whether its operation will promote the\n       traditional aims of punishment—retribution and deterrence, [5] whether the\n       behavior to which it applies is already a crime, [6] whether an alternative purpose\n       to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and [7] whether it\n       appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.” [People v\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       Earl, 495 Mich 33, 44; 845 NW2d 721 (2014), quoting Mendoza-Martinez, 372\n       US at 168-169 (alterations in Earl).]\n\nThese seven factors serve as “useful guideposts” and are “neither exhaustive nor dispositive.”\nEarl, 495 Mich at 44 Further, a party asserting that a statutory scheme imposes punishment\nmust provide “ ‘the clearest proof’ ” that the scheme “ ‘is so punitive either in purpose or effect\nto negate the . . . intention to deem it civil.’ ” Id., quoting Kansas v Hendricks, 521 US 346, 361;\n117 S Ct 2072; 138 L Ed 2d 501 (1997) (alteration in Earl).\n\n        In this case, defendant does not dispute that the Legislature did not intend SORA to\nconstitute punishment. Indeed, the Legislature explicitly stated that its intent was not to impose\npunishment. MCL 28.721a. Based largely on this statement of purpose, this Court has\n“conclude[d] that the Legislature intended SORA as a civil remedy to protect the health and\nwelfare of the public.” Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 262. Therefore, it is necessary to look to\nthe Mendoza-Martinez factors to determine whether the school safety zones and in-person\nreporting requirements are so punitive in purpose or effect that they negate the Legislature’s\nintent to deem them civil. See id. at 262. In this endeavor, we first find instructive the United\nStates Supreme Court’s application of the Mendoza-Martinez factors to the Alaska sex offender\nregistration statute in Smith v Doe, 538 US 84; 123 S Ct 1140; 155 L Ed 2d 164 (2003).\n\n                                            C. SMITH\n\n        Smith “is the preeminent case holding that a sex offender registration and notification\nlaw, as applied to an adult defendant, is not a form of punishment.” Temelkoski, 307 Mich App\nat 263. The Supreme Court applied the Mendoza-Martinez factors and determined that the\nAlaska sex offender registration statute, Alaska Stat § 12.63.010 et seq., did not constitute\npunishment for ex post facto purposes. Smith, 538 US at 97-106.\n\n                      1. AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OR RESTRAINT\n\n        The Smith Court first observed that sex offender registration does not resemble\nimprisonment, “the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint.” Smith, 538 US at 100. The\nCourt noted that the Alaska statute did “not restrain activities sex offenders may pursue but\nleaves them free to change jobs or residences.” Id. The Court also reasoned that although\nregistration may negatively affect offenders, such as in finding housing and employment, “these\nconsequences flow not from the Act’s registration and dissemination provisions, but from the\nfact of conviction, already a matter of public record.” Id. at 101. Finally, the Court noted that\noffenders were not required to register in person. Id.\n\n        The Court also rejected the contention that registration is akin to probation or supervised\nrelease, although it acknowledged that the argument “has some force.” Id. at 101. The Court\nexplained that “[p]robation and supervised release entail a series of mandatory conditions and\nallow the supervising officer to seek the revocation of probation or release in case of infraction.”\nId. Sex offenders, on the other hand, were “free to move where they wish and to live and work\nas other citizens, with no supervision.” Id. And although registrants were required to “inform\nthe authorities after they change their facial features (such as growing a beard), borrow a car, or\nseek psychiatric treatment, they [were] not required to seek permission to do so.” Id. Further,\n\n                                                -8-\n\falthough offenders faced criminal penalties for failing to comply with reporting requirements,\nsuch penalties arose from proceedings that were separate from their underlying offense. Id. at\n101-102.\n\n                               2. HISTORICAL PUNISHMENTS\n\n        The Court found any resemblance between sex offender registration and historical\nshaming punishments “misleading.” Smith, 538 US at 97-98. “Punishments such as whipping,\npillory, and branding,” the Court explained, “inflicted physical pain and staged a direct\nconfrontation between the offender and the public.” Id. at 98. Conversely, the stigma attached\nto a registered sex offender “results not from public display for ridicule and shaming but from\nthe dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record, most of which is already\npublic.” Id. The Court reasoned, “Our system does not treat dissemination of truthful\ninformation in furtherance of a legitimate governmental objective as punishment.” Id. The\nCourt also stated that adverse effects felt by registrants, such as “mild personal embarrassment”\nand “social ostracism” were not “an integral part of the objective of the regulatory scheme.” Id.\nat 99.\n\n        The Court added that “[t]he fact that Alaska posts the information on the Internet d[id]\nnot alter [its] conclusion.” Smith, 538 US at 99. “The purpose and the principal effect of\nnotification are to inform the public for its own safety, not to humiliate the offender,” the Court\nexplained. Id. “Widespread public access is necessary for the efficacy of the scheme, and the\nattendant humiliation is but a collateral consequence of a valid regulation.” Id. “The process is\nmore analogous,” the Court stated, “to a visit to an official archive of criminal records than it is\nto a scheme forcing an offender to appear in public with some visible badge of past criminality.”\nId. The Court also observed that the registry was passive, as a member of the public must seek\nout the information on the website. Id. The Court further noted that Alaska’s website did not\nallow the public to shame an offender by, for example, “posting comments underneath his\nrecord.” Id.\n\n                                          3. SCIENTER\n\n       The Smith Court found this factor to be “of little weight” without extended explanation.\nSmith, 538 US at 105.\n\n    4. TRADITIONAL AIMS OF PUNISHMENT: DETERRENCE AND RETRIBUTION\n\n        The Court stated that it was undisputed that the sex offender registry could potentially\ndeter crime. Smith, 538 US at 102. But the Court noted that “[a]ny number of governmental\nprograms might deter crime without imposing punishment.” Id. The Court reasoned, “ ‘To hold\nthat the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions “criminal” . . . would\nseverely undermine the Government’s ability to engage in effective regulation.’ ” Id., quoting\nHudson v United States, 522 US 93, 105; 118 S Ct 488; 139 L Ed 2d 450 (1997).\n\n        The Court also disagreed with the proposition that registration was retributive because the\nlength of time that an offender was required to register “appear[ed] to be measured by the extent\nof the wrongdoing, not by the extent of the risk posed.” Smith, 538 US at 102 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). Although the Court acknowledged that the statute “differentiate[d]\n                                                -9-\n\fbetween individuals convicted of aggravated or multiple offenses and those convicted of a single\nnonaggravated offense,” it found that such “broad categories” and the “corresponding length of\nthe reporting requirement” were “reasonably related to the danger of recidivism,” which was\n“consistent with the regulatory objective.” Id.\n\n                                   5. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR\n\n        Along with the scienter factor, the Court found this factor to be “of little weight.” Smith,\n538 US at 105. “The regulatory scheme applies only to past conduct, which was, and is, a\ncrime,” the Court explained. Id. The Court stated that this was “a necessary beginning point, for\nrecidivism is the statutory concern.” Id. The Court added that “[t]he obligations the statute\nimpose[d] are the responsibility of registration, a duty not predicated upon some present or\nrepeated violation.” Id.\n\n               6. RATIONAL CONNECTION TO A NONPUNITIVE PURPOSE\n\n        The Court held that this was the most significant factor in its determination. Smith, 538\nUS at 102. The Court stated that the Alaska sex offender registration statute had “a legitimate\nnonpunitive purpose of public safety, which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex\noffenders in their communit[y].” Id. at 102-103 (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration\nin Smith). According to the Court, the respondents acknowledged that this purpose was valid\nand rational. Id. at 103. They argued, however, that the statute “lack[ed] the necessary\nregulatory connection because it [was] not narrowly drawn to accomplish the stated purpose.”\nId. (quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court rejected that argument and stated, “A\nstatute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit with the nonpunitive\naims it seeks to advance.” Id.\n\n                                      7. EXCESSIVENESS\n\n        The Smith Court rejected the contention that the statute was excessive because it applied\nto all convicted sex offenders without individual determinations of dangerousness. Smith, 538\nUS at 103. “Alaska could conclude that a conviction for a sex offense provides evidence of\nsubstantial risk of recidivism,” the Court reasoned. Id. The Court found this to be “consistent\nwith grave concerns over the high rate of recidivism among convicted sex offenders and their\ndangerousness as a class.” Id. The Court noted that “[t]he risk of recidivism posed by sex\noffenders is ‘frightening and high.’ ” Id., quoting McKune v Lile, 536 US 24, 34; 122 S Ct 2017;\n153 L Ed 2d 47 (2002). The Court stated, “The Ex Post Facto Clause does not preclude a State\nfrom making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail\nparticular regulatory consequences.” Smith, 538 US at 103. The Court further explained that a\nlegislature has the power to fashion “a rule of universal application.” Id. at 104 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). “The State’s determination to legislate with respect to convicted sex\noffenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of their dangerousness, does not\nmake the statute a punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.” Id. The Court stated that\nAlaska was permitted to “dispense with individual predictions of future dangerousness and allow\nthe public to assess the risk on the basis of accurate, nonprivate information about the registrants’\nconvictions without” thereby imposing punishment. Id.\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\f        The Court also rejected the argument that the duration of the reporting requirements was\nexcessive. Id. at 104. The Court relied on empirical research, which showed that most child\nmolesters who reoffend do so not within the first several years after they were released but “ ‘as\nlate as 20 years following release.’ ” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n        The Court likewise rejected the contention that the registry was excessive because of its\nwide dissemination. Smith, 538 US at 104. The Court reiterated that the registry was passive\nbecause “[a]n individual must seek access to the information.” Id. at 105. The Alaska website\nalso warned “that the use of displayed information to commit a criminal act against another\nperson is subject to criminal prosecution.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Given\nthe general mobility of our population,” the Court reasoned, “for Alaska to make its registry\nsystem available and easily accessible throughout the State was not so excessive a regulatory\nrequirement as to become a punishment.” Id. The Court stated that determining excessiveness\n“is not an exercise in determining whether the legislature has made the best choice possible to\naddress the problem it seeks to remedy,” but “whether the regulatory means chosen are\nreasonable in light of the nonpunitive objective.” Id. The Court concluded that the Alaska\nstatute met that standard. Id.\n\n     D. APPLICATION OF THE MENDOZA-MARTINEZ FACTORS TO SCHOOL SAFETY\n               ZONES AND IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        This Court in Temelkoski generally endorsed the analysis in Smith. Temelkoski, 307\nMich App at 262-270. As noted, however, the Michigan SORA has changed substantially since\nit was first enacted in 1994. Further, given recent amendments, it is also markedly different from\nthe statute reviewed by the United States Supreme Court in Smith in 2003. Although defendant\nargues that SORA as a whole is unconstitutional, he primarily takes issue with the school safety\nzones and in-person reporting requirements. Temelkoski did not address these particular\nprovisions, although it generally held that sex offender registration does not impose punishment.\nId. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the sex offender registration does not impose\npunishment and focus on whether the school safety zones and in-person reporting requirements\nare punitive in purpose or effect using the Mendoza-Martinez factors.10\n\n                      1. AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OF RESTRAINT\n\n                                 a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n\n\n\n10\n   The prosecution relies heavily on Doe v Snyder, 932 F Supp 2d 803, 811-814 (ED Mich,\n2013), in which the court purportedly held that the recent amendments to SORA did not make\nthe scheme punitive in effect. The court stated that the new provisions had “repeatedly been\nupheld.” Id. at 811. However, the court relied on cases from 1999 and 2000 for that proposition,\nand the school safety zone and in-person reporting provisions were added after those cases were\ndecided. See id. Therefore, we find that decision unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\f        Some state courts have concluded that school safety zones impose an affirmative\ndisability or restraint on sex offenders.11 The Supreme Court of Indiana, addressing a similar\nprovision barring sex offenders from residing within 1,000 feet of school property, held that such\na restriction “is neither minor nor indirect.” State v Pollard, 908 NE2d 1145, 1147, 1150 (Ind,\n2009). The Indiana law, however, did not include a grandfather provision, and thus barred\nregistrants from living within 1,000 feet of a school even if the registrant had lived there before\nthe law was passed. Id. at 1150. The law also required a registrant to change residences if a\nschool or youth program center opened within 1,000 feet of the registrant’s residence. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court of Kentucky, addressing a provision disallowing sex offenders from\nliving within 1,000 feet of a school, stated that it found it “difficult to imagine that being\nprohibited from residing within certain areas does not qualify as an affirmative disability or\nrestraint.” Commonwealth v Baker, 295 SW3d 437, 439-441, 445 (Ky, 2009). Similar to the\nIndiana law, a registrant in Kentucky “face[d] a constant threat of eviction” because he or she\nwould be forced to move if a school opened upon within 1,000 feet of his or her home. Id.\n\n        But other courts have held to the contrary. The Supreme Court of Iowa, addressing a\nstatute prohibiting sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school, recognized that such a\nprovision “clearly impose[s] a form of disability.” State v Seering, 701 NW2d 655, 659, 668\n(Iowa, 2005). But the court held that “the disabling nature of the statute is not absolute.” Id.\nThe court added, “[W]e are mindful of the objectives of the residency restriction under the\nstatute and understand that a statute that imposes some degree of disability does not necessarily\nmean the state is imposing punishment.” Id.\n\n        We agree with the reasoning of the Indiana and Kentucky courts. Prohibiting registrants\nfrom living and working in many areas is undoubtedly an affirmative restraint. Further, the\ngrandfather clause in Michigan is limited, as it only applies to residences where the offenders\nwere living before January 1, 2006. MCL 28.735(3)(c). If that clause does not apply and a\nperson who lives in a school safety zone commits a sex offense and is required to register, he or\nshe will be forced to leave his or her home. MCL 28.735(4). Therefore, rather than merely\nrestraining sex offenders, the school safety zone may expel offenders in certain circumstances.\nAlso, offenders who are not protected by the grandfather clause face the constant prospect that\nthey will be forced to move if a new school opens near their home. Unlike in Smith, offenders\nunder the current Michigan SORA are not entirely free to change residences or jobs given the\nstudent safety zone provisions. Although we agree with the Seering Court that such a restraint is\nnot “absolute,” it is a restraint nonetheless. See Seering, 701 NW2d at 659.\n\n\n\n\n11\n  Cases from foreign jurisdictions are not binding on this Court, but may be persuasive. People\nv Campbell, 289 Mich App 533, 535; 798 NW2d 514 (2010). Similarly, lower federal court\ndecisions are not binding on this Court, but may be persuasive. People v Fomby, 300 Mich App\n46, 50 n 1; 831 NW2d 887 (2013).\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\f                        b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Some state courts have also concluded that frequent in-person reporting requirements\nimpose an affirmative disability or restraint. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that a\nsimilar provision requiring quarterly, in-person reporting “place[d] substantial restrictions on the\nmovements of lifetime registrants and may work an impractical impediment that amounts to an\naffirmative disability.” State v Letalien, 2009 ME 130, ¶ 37; 985 A2d 4 (2009) (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). Distinguishing the reporting requirement at issue in Smith, the court stated\nthat the requirement of quarterly, in-person reporting for life “is undoubtedly a form of\nsignificant supervision by the state.” Id. “[I]t belies common sense,” the court concluded, “to\nsuggest that a newly imposed lifetime obligation to report to a police station every ninety days to\nverify one’s identification, residence, and school, and to submit to fingerprinting[12] and provide\na current photograph,[13] is not a substantial disability or restraint on the free exercise of\nindividual liberty.” Id. at ¶ 56. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire recently endorsed the\nLetalien Court’s reasoning. Doe v State, 167 NH 382, 405; 111 A3d 1077 (2015).\n\n       The Supreme Court of Oklahoma adopted the same reasoning regarding its similar in-\nperson reporting requirements. Starkey v Oklahoma Dep’t of Corrections, 2013 OK 43, ¶ 49;\n305 P3d 1004 (2013). Like defendant in the case at hand, the defendant in Starkey would have\nbeen required, under threat of prosecution, “to make an ‘in person’ appearance every 90 days for\nlife and every time he moves, changes employment, changes student status, or resides\nsomewhere for 7 consecutive days or longer.” Id. See also MCL 28.725a(3)(c); MCL 28.725(1).\nThe Supreme Court of Oklahoma deemed these requirements “significant and intrusive.”\nStarkey, 2013 OK at ¶ 49.\n\n        But other courts have disagreed. United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in\nUnited States v Parks, 698 F3d 1, 5-6 (CA 1, 2012), held that although periodic in-person\nreporting is inconvenient, such “inconvenience is surely minor compared to the disadvantages of\nthe underlying scheme in its consequences for renting housing, obtaining work and the like—\nconsequences that were part of the package that Smith itself upheld.” The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit in United States v WBH, 664 F3d 848, 857 (CA 11, 2011),\nlikewise held that quarterly in-person reporting “may be more inconvenient, but requiring it is\nnot punitive.”\n\n       We agree with the reasoning of the Maine and Oklahoma courts. The reporting\nrequirements in Michigan are onerous. Reporting requirements vary by “tier,” and Tier III\noffenders such as defendant are required to report in person four times a year for life. MCL\n\n\n\n12\n     The Michigan SORA requires fingerprinting only once. MCL 28.727(1)(q).\n13\n  Under the Michigan SORA, registrants must have a new photograph taken if “[t]he officer or\nauthorized employee” determines that the registrant’s preexisting photograph does not “match[]\nthe appearance of the individual sufficiently to properly identify him or her from that\nphotograph.” MCL 28.725a(5).\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f28.725a(3). In addition, MCL 28.725(1) provides, in part, that all registrants must report in\nperson after any of the following events occur:\n\n               (a) The individual changes or vacates his or her residence or domicile.\n\n             (b) The individual changes his or her place of employment, or\n       employment is discontinued.\n\n              (c) The individual enrolls as a student with an institution of higher\n       education, or enrollment is discontinued.\n\n               (d) The individual changes his or her name.\n\n               (e) The individual intends to temporarily reside at any place other than his\n       or her residence for more than 7 days.\n\n              (f) The individual establishes any electronic mail or instant message\n       address, or any other designations used in internet communications or postings.\n\n             (g) The individual purchases or begins to regularly operate any vehicle,\n       and when ownership or operation of the vehicle is discontinued.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in Smith noted that the scheme in that case did not impose a\ndisability or restraint because offenders were not required to report in person. Smith, 538 US at\n101. In contrast, under the current Michigan SORA, offenders are required to report in person\nup to four times a year and after any of the events listed in MCL 28.725a occurs. Many of the\nevents listed in MCL 28.725a(3) may occur frequently in the life of an average person. Thus, the\nin-person reporting requirements strike us as more than a mere inconvenience. Rather, we\nconclude that they amount to an affirmative disability or restraint. See id.\n\n                               2. HISTORICAL PUNISHMENTS\n\n                                 a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n        Some courts have concluded that school safety zones are analogous to historical\npunishments. The Pollard Court stated that “restrictions on living in certain areas is not an\nuncommon condition of probation or parole.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1151. Courts have also\ncompared the restrictions to banishment. “Banishment” is defined as “ ‘a punishment inflicted\nupon criminals, by compelling them to quit a city, place, or country, for a specific period of time,\nor for life.’ ” United States v Ju Toy, 198 US 253, 269-270; 25 S Ct 644; 49 L Ed 1040 (1905)\n(citation omitted). The Baker Court found that the restrictions that prevented offenders from\nliving in certain areas and that expelled offenders from their homes were “decidedly similar to\nbanishment.” Baker, 295 SW3d at 444. The Starkey Court concurred with that reasoning.\nStarkey, 2013 OK at ¶ 60.\n\n        But other courts have denied that registration is similar to banishment. The Supreme\nCourt of Iowa stated that although the defendant “may have a sense of being banished to another\narea of the city, county, or state,” registration did not amount to “true banishment,” which “goes\n\n                                               -14-\n\fbeyond the mere restriction of ‘one’s freedom to go or remain where others have the right to be:\nit often works a destruction on one’s social, cultural, and political existence.’ ” Seering, 701\nNW2d at 667, quoting Poodry v Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, 85 F3d 874, 897 (CA 2,\n1996). The court added that “[o]ffenders are not banished from communities and are free to\nengage in most community activities.” Id. at 667.\n\n        We agree with the reasoning in Pollard and Baker that the restrictions created by the\nschool safety zone provisions resemble banishment. Unlike in Smith, registrants are\naffirmatively barred from living in certain areas. Also, unless offenders are protected by the\nlimited grandfather provision, they can be expelled from their residences as a consequence of\nregistration. Although admittedly not true banishment, we find the similarity undeniable.\nFurther, restrictions on where an offender can live or work are common conditions of probation\nor supervised release. Smith, 538 US at 101. Therefore, we believe that the restrictions imposed\nby the school safety zones have historically been regarded as a punishment.\n\n                       b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n       Cases addressing in-person reporting requirements have focused on the similarity to\nprobation and parole. The Supreme Court of Indiana concluded that in-person reporting was\n“comparable to conditions of supervised probation or parole.” Wallace v State, 905 NE2d 371,\n376, 380 (Ind, 2009). However, the Wyoming Supreme Court disagreed that in-person reporting\nrequirements were similar to probation or parole, relying on Smith. Kammerer v State, 2014 WY\n50, ¶ 22; 322 P3d 827 (Wy, 2014). The court denied that registration was similar to\n“monitoring . . . imposed under supervised probation or parole.” Id.\n\n        Many of the considerations noted by Smith still apply to the current Michigan SORA.\nSex offenders are not required to seek permission to do many things, such as change residences\nor cars, but are only required to report such changes. Also, penalties for failing to comply with\nSORA arise from proceedings separate from the offender’s underlying offense. But the scheme\nexamined in Smith did not entail in-person reporting. As stated, defendant, as a Tier III offender,\nmust report in person four times each year for the rest of his life, MCL 28.725a(3)(c), as well as\nupon the occurrence of any events listed in MCL 28.725(1). This is far more intrusive than the\nreporting requirements in Smith and imposes a great amount of supervision by the state. We\nagree with the Wallace Court that such demanding in-person reporting requirements are at least\n“comparable to conditions of supervised probation or parole.” See Wallace, 905 NE2d at 380.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -15-\n\f                                          3. SCIENTER\n\n        This Court has declined to consider this factor in assessing whether sex offender\nregistration constitutes punishment. Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 262.14 We therefore decline\nto address the factor. See id.\n\n     4. TRADITIONAL AIMS OF PUNISHMENT: DETERRENCE AND RETRIBUTION\n\n                                 a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n        Some courts have concluded that school safety zones promote deterrence and retribution\nto such a degree that they are punitive. The court in Pollard stated that such restrictions are\n“apparently designed to reduce the likelihood of future crimes by depriving the offender of the\nopportunity to commit those crimes.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1152. The court determined that the\nprovision was “an even more direct deterrent to sex offenders than the . . . registration and\nnotification regime.” Id. The court in Baker found that such restrictions are retributive given\nthat there was “no individualized determination of the dangerousness of a particular registrant.”\nBaker, 295 SW3d at 444. The court noted that “[e]ven those registrants whose victims were\nadults are prohibited from living near an area where children gather.” Id. “When a restriction is\nimposed equally upon all offenders, with no consideration given to how dangerous any particular\nregistrant may be to public safety,” the court concluded, “that restriction begins to look far more\nlike retribution for past offenses than a regulation intended to prevent future ones.” Id. The\ncourt in Starkey essentially adopted the same reasoning. Starkey, 2013 OK at ¶ 66. Courts\nconcluding to the contrary have relied on the statement from Smith that government programs\ncan deter crime without imposing punishment. See, e.g., Seering, 701 NW2d at 668; Kammerer,\n2014 WY at ¶¶ 26.\n\n        The primary reason for the creation of the school safety zones is the desire to specifically\ndeter future sexual offenses by registrants. As in Pollard, it appears that the provisions were\n“designed to reduce the likelihood of future crimes by depriving the offender of the opportunity\nto commit those crimes.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1152. Nonetheless, the disclaimer from Smith\nstill applies: “[a]ny number of governmental programs might deter crime without imposing\npunishment.” Smith, 538 US at 102. But the school safety zone provisions are unlike the statute\nat issue in Smith. In that case, the Alaska statute was a passive notification scheme designed to\nallow members of the public to protect themselves from sex offenders. In this case, the school\nsafety zone provisions are not passive. Rather, registrants are specifically prohibited them from\nliving, working, and loitering in many areas. We agree with the observation of the Pollard Court\nthat school safety zones are “an even more direct deterrent to sex offenders than the . . .\nregistration and notification regime.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1152. In sum, we find that the\nforemost purpose of the school safety zones is deterrence.\n\n\n\n14\n   We note that other courts have concluded that because most sex offenses require a finding of\nscienter, this factor counsels in favor of deeming registration punishment. See, e.g., Doe v State,\n189 P3d 999, 1012-1013 (Alas, 2008).\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\f       However, we disagree that the school safety zones are necessarily retributive. Although\nthe observations of the Baker Court have some merit, we are mindful of the admonition that the\nLegislature is permitted to legislate with regard to sex offenders as a class without individual\ndeterminations of future dangerousness. See Smith, 538 US at 103. It is the province of the\nLegislature to determine that all sex offenders, regardless of their offenses, should be segregated\nfrom children. While one can reasonably question the usefulness of such a broadly sweeping\nmeasure, “[a] statute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit with the\nnonpunitive aims it seeks to advance.” Id. Therefore, we cannot say that the school safety zones\nhave the purpose or effect of promoting retribution. See id.\n\n                       b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Cases have not extensively addressed whether in-person reporting requirements promote\ndeterrence and retribution. The requirements are designed to ensure that the information\nprovided on the registry is accurate and up-to-date. Accurate and up-to-date information is\nessential to “monitoring those persons” who the “legislature has determined . . . pose[] a\npotential serious menace and danger to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people, and\nparticularly the children, of this state.” MCL 28.721a. Therefore, we cannot conclude that such\nmeasures necessarily promote deterrence or retribution. Still, we acknowledge that more\nrigorous reporting requirements could promote deterrence and retribution. If, for example,\noffenders were required to report in person twice daily, such onerous requirements could begin\nto appear less useful to promoting the regulatory goals of SORA and more like deterrence and\nretribution. However, the reporting requirements are not so extreme. Tier III offenders, those\nsubjected to the most reporting requirements, are only required to report four times each year, as\nwell as upon the occurrence of any events listed in MCL 28.725(1). See MCL 28.725a(3)(c).\nAlthough certainly burdensome for the offenders, we cannot say that these requirements promote\ndeterrence or retribution to such an extent that they are punitive. See id.\n\n                                   5. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR\n\n        Like the United States Supreme Court, this Court has declined to consider this factor in\nassessing whether sex offender registration constitutes punishment. Temelkoski, 307 Mich App\nat 262.15 Therefore, we decline to address this factor. See id.\n\n              6. RATIONAL CONNECTION TO A NONPUNITIVE PURPOSE\n\n        As defendant admits, nearly every court has held that sex offender registration laws serve\na nonpunitive purpose of public safety. However, defendant questions whether the connection is\nrational. He calls attention to law review articles that advance the proposition that registration\n\n\n15\n  We note that the Alaska Supreme Court in Doe concluded that because registration laws only\napply to convicted sex offenders and not “other individuals who may pose a threat to society\neven if they were not convicted,” the effect was punitive. Doe, 189 P3d at 1014-1015. For\nexample, registration laws do not apply to “defendants whose convictions are overturned for\nreasons other than insufficiency of evidence of guilt.” Id. at 1015.\n\n\n                                               -17-\n\flaws do not reduce recidivism and that sex offenders, as a class, are not prone to recidivism.\nWhile perhaps true that in certain circumstances the school safety zones and in-person reporting\nrequirements do more harm than good, we cannot conclude that they are irrational measures for\naccomplishing the stated regulatory purpose of SORA. Further, we are not charged with\ndetermining the wisdom of these measures. Such questions are for the Legislature to decide.\nPeople v Wallace, 284 Mich App 467, 470; 772 NW2d 820 (2009) (noting that the wisdom of a\npolicy is a political question). Similarly, it is the Legislature that is charged with the authority to\nrevisit, if it so chooses, the efficacy of the legislation. See id.\n\n        To the extent that defendant and amicus argue that the recapture provision is not rational\nas applied to defendant given that defendant’s last sex offense conviction was 25 years ago, we\nmust disagree. The argument has some merit, but we cannot conclude that requiring defendant\nto register as a sex offender is wholly irrational. Although defendant’s sex offense conviction\nwas 25 years ago, he committed another felony in 2013, and has “shown a general tendency to\nrecidivate.” See People v Fredericks, 2014 Ill App 122122, ¶ 60; 383 Ill Dec 293; 14 NE3d 576\n(2014).\n\n                                       7. EXCESSIVENESS\n\n                                  a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n       Some courts have held that the broad application of student safety zones is excessive.\nThe Supreme Court of Indiana in Pollard stated, “Restricting the residence of offenders based on\nconduct that may have nothing to do with crimes against children, and without considering\nwhether a particular offender is a danger to the general public, the statute exceeds its non-\npunitive purposes.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1153. The Supreme Court of Kentucky likewise\nconcluded that given the magnitude of the restraint imposed by residency restrictions, the lack of\nindividual determinations of the future dangerousness of registrants rendered the restrictions\nexcessive. Baker, 295 SW3d at 446. Other courts have concluded to the contrary. The Supreme\nCourt of Iowa in Seering concluded that given “the special needs of children” and “the imprecise\nnature of protecting children from the risk that convicted sex offenders might reoffend,”\nresidency restrictions are not excessive. Seering, 701 NW2d at 668.\n\n        We find that the Supreme Court’s observations from Smith still apply. The Legislature is\n“not preclude[d] . . . from making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified\ncrimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.” Smith, 538 US at 103. The Court\nexplained that the legislature had the power to fashion “a rule of universal application.” Id. at\n104 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, “[t]he State’s determination to legislate\nwith respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of\ntheir dangerousness, does not make the statute a punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.”\nId.\n\n       One can reasonably question the usefulness of prohibiting certain offenders from living\nand working within the zones even though their offenses were not committed against children.\nDespite these reservations, as we have already noted, the wisdom of a statute is a question for the\nLegislature. Wallace, 284 Mich App at 470. Moreover, the Legislature was not precluded from\n\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fmaking categorical judgments of this nature. Smith, 538 US at 103. Therefore, the school safety\nzones prohibition is not excessive.\n\n                        b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Courts have not extensively addressed whether in-person reporting requirements are\nexcessive. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire found the lifetime duration of registration to\nbe excessive. Doe, 167 NH at 410. “If in fact there is no meaningful risk to the public, then the\nimposition of such requirements becomes wholly punitive.” Id. We disagree. Again, the\nLegislature is tasked with determining the risk posed by sex offenders. Moreover, although the\nin-person reporting requirements of the Michigan SORA are onerous, it is difficult to conclude\nthat they are necessarily excessive. Rather, as stated, they are reasonably designed to ensure that\nthe information on the registry is accurate and up-to-date. Therefore, the in-person reporting\nrequirements are not excessive.\n\n                                        E. CONCLUSION\n\n                                 1. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n        As is apparent from our foregoing discussion, the Mendoza-Martinez factors point us in\nboth directions when it comes to school safety zones. We conclude that such zones impose\naffirmative restraints, resemble historical punishments, and promote deterrence. However, we\nalso conclude that they are rationally connected to the nonpunitive purpose of public safety and\nthat they are not excessive, as the Legislature is permitted to make the categorical judgment that\nsex offenders should not live, work, or loiter near schools. Weighing these factors, we are\nmindful that the burden lies with defendant to establish that school safety zones are punitive. As\nstated, a party asserting that a statutory scheme imposes punishment must provide “the clearest\nproof” that the scheme “ ‘is so punitive either in purpose or effect to negate the . . . intention to\ndeem it civil.’ ” Earl, 495 Mich at 44, quoting Hendricks, 521 US at 361 (alteration in Earl). In\nthis case, given that the Mendoza-Martinez factors cut both ways, we cannot conclude that\ndefendant has met his burden. Further, even some of the factors that weigh in defendant’s favor\nonly do so to a limited extent. The zones plainly restrict where offenders can live and work, but\nthe restriction is not absolute, and, therefore, the restrictions are distinguishable from true\nbanishment. And although the zones specifically deter the registered offenders, the Smith Court\nheld that even a deterrent purpose will not render a civil regulatory scheme punitive. Smith, 538\nUS at 102. Moreover, the nonpunitive purpose of the zones is the most important factor in\ndetermining whether they are punitive in effect. See id. Given these considerations, there is not\nthe clearest proof that the school safety zones are so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate the\nLegislature’s intent to deem them civil. See id.\n\n                        2. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Regarding the in-person reporting requirements, the Mendoza-Martinez factors do not\nreadily lead to one conclusion over the other. The requirements impose affirmative restraints\nand arguably resemble conditions of probation and supervised release. However, they do not\nnecessarily promote deterrence or retribution, they are rationally connected to the nonpunitive\npurpose of protecting the public by ensuring that the registry is accurate, and they are not\n\n                                                -19-\n\fexcessive. As with the school safety zones, we cannot find the clearest proof that they are\npunitive in effect given that the Mendoz-Martinez factors cut both ways. Further, we again find\nthat even some of the factors that weigh in defendant’s favor only do so to a limited extent.\nAlthough the reporting requirements are undeniably burdensome, their restraining effect is not\nabsolute. Registrants are not precluded from many activities, such as changing residences or\njobs, but are merely required to report them. And many of the considerations that Smith used to\ndistinguish sex offender registration from probation and supervised release still apply to the in-\nperson reporting requirements. Moreover, the nonpunitive purpose of the zones is the most\nimportant factor in determining whether they are punitive in effect. See Smith, 538 US at 102.\nGiven these considerations, we conclude that there is not the clearest proof that the in-person\nreporting requirements are so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate the Legislature’s intent to\ndeem them civil.\n\n\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       We conclude that the recapture provision in MCL 28.723(1)(e) is constitutional. First,\nthe recapture provision found in MCL 28.723(1)(e) did not change the legal consequences of\ndefendant’s 1990 conviction. Rather, it attached legal consequences to his 2013 convictions.\nTherefore, that provision does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal\nConstitutions. Second, the school safety zones and in-person reporting requirements of SORA\ndo not constitute punishment. Therefore, they necessarily cannot constitute cruel or unusual\npunishment.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n                                                             /s/ Joel P.

Defendant was sentenced, as a\nsecond habitual offender, MCL 769.10, to 119 days, time served, for the felonious assault\nconviction and 93 days, time served, for the domestic violence conviction. Defendant was also\nrequired to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), MCL\n28.721et seq. We affirm.\n\n                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Defendant was convicted in 1990 of assault with intent to commit criminal sexual\nconduct involving penetration, MCL 750.520g(1). He was sentenced to three years’ probation\nand was discharged in 1993. On October 1, 1995, SORA went into effect. Although assault\nwith intent to commit criminal sexual conduct involving penetration is a “listed offense”\nrequiring registration, MCL 28.722(w)(iv), defendant was not required to register because he was\ndischarged from probation before the registry went into effect, MCL 28.723(1). In 2011, the\nLegislature amended SORA, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, to include the following “recapture” provision,\ncodified at MCL 28.723(1)(e):\n\n\n\n\n1\n See People v Tucker, unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, entered July 3, 2014 (Docket\nNo. 322151).\n\n\n                                              -1-\n\f                 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the following individuals who are domiciled\n         or temporarily reside in this state or who work with or without compensation or\n         are students in this state are required to be registered under this act:\n\n                                              * * *\n\n                (e) An individual who was previously convicted of a listed offense for\n         which he or she was not required to register under this act, but who is convicted\n         of any other felony on or after July 1, 2011.\n\n        On October 8, 2013, defendant pleaded no contest to felonious assault, MCL 750.82, and\ndomestic violence, MCL 750.81(2), under a Cobbs2 agreement under which he would be\nsentenced to time served. At sentencing, the trial court told defendant that he would be required\nto register as a sex offender under MCL 28.723(1)(e)3 and gave defendant the opportunity to\nwithdraw his plea. Defendant declined. Defendant was required to register for life as a “Tier\nIII” offender.\n\n        Defendant then filed a motion to correct an invalid sentence in order for the trial court to\nremove him from the SORA registry, arguing that the registration requirement violated the state\nand federal Ex Post Facto Clauses, the federal Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, and the\nstate Cruel or Unusual Punishment Clause. The trial court denied the motion and determined\nthat defendant was required to register under the terms of the law.\n\n                                 II. EX POST FACTO CLAUSES\n\n     Defendant first contends that the requirement that he register as a sex offender under\nSORA violates the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal Constitutions. We disagree.\n\n         We review de novo issues of constitutional law. People v Temelkoski, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

All laws that violate ex post facto protections exhibit the same two elements: “(1) they\nattach legal consequences to acts before their effective date, and (2) they work to the\ndisadvantage of the defendant.” Id. at 318. “The critical question [for an ex post facto violation]\nis whether the law changes the legal consequences of acts completed before its effective date.”\nId. (citations and quotation marks omitted; alteration in Callon; emphasis omitted). This Court\nhas identified four circumstances that implicate the Ex Post Facto Clauses:\n\n\n\n2\n    People v Cobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2123754\"><a href=\"/opinion/2123754/people-v-cobbs/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; 505 NW2d 208 (1993).\n3\n  Defendant was required to register under MCL 28.723(1)(e) because of his felonious assault\nconviction, which is a felony. See MCL 750.82(1). His domestic violence conviction is a\nmisdemeanor conviction. MCL 750.81(2).\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f       A statute that affects the prosecution or disposition of criminal cases involving\n       crimes committed before the effective date of the statute violates the Ex Post\n       Facto Clauses if it (1) makes punishable that which was not, (2) makes an act a\n       more serious criminal offense, (3) increases the punishment, or (4) allows the\n       prosecution to convict on less evidence.

Plaintiff counters that MCL\n28.723(1)(e) cannot constitute an ex post facto law because it attaches legal consequences to\ndefendant’s 2013 convictions, not his 1990 conviction.\n\n        We find caselaw on recidivist statutes helpful in answering this question.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994). Callon is instructive in this\nregard. The defendant in Callon was convicted of impaired driving, MCL 257.625(3), in 1993.\nCallon, 256 Mich App at 315. On October 9, 1999, he was arrested for operating a vehicle under\nthe influence of intoxicating liquors or while having a blood alcohol content of 0.10 grams or\nmore per 100 milliliters of blood (OUIL/UBAL), MCL 257.625(1). Id. at 314. During the\nperiod between the two offenses, the Legislature amended the pertinent statute so that a previous\nimpaired-driving conviction could be used to enhance a subsequent OUIL/UBAL conviction. Id.\nat 315-316. This Court rejected the defendant’s ex post facto challenge to this enhancement,\nholding that the amendment to the statute had not altered the legal consequences of his 1993\nconviction, but rather altered the legal consequences of his 1999 conviction. Id. at 318. This\nCourt explained, “[T]he conduct for which defendant is being punished is driving while\nintoxicated or with an unlawful blood alcohol level after having fair notice that the statute had\nbeen amended to permit enhancement of an OUIL/UBAL conviction with a prior impaired-\ndriving conviction.” Id. at 319. This Court concluded, “Simply put, there is no retroactive\napplication of the law where a prior conviction is used to enhance the penalty for a new offense\ncommitted after the effective date of the statute.” Id. at 321.\n\n        In this case, although MCL 28.723(1)(e) is not a traditional recidivist statute, the\nreasoning of Callon applies nonetheless. Defendant’s registration was not required until he\ncommitted another felony in 2013. His 1990 conviction was used to enhance the consequences\nof his 2013 felony, which was committed after the effective date of the statute. This would be a\ndifferent case if on July 1, 2011, the effective date of MCL 28.723(1)(e), defendant had been\nimmediately required to register as a sex offender because of his 1990 conviction alone. Rather,\ndefendant is required to register in connection with the 2013 felony. Defendant’s registration in\nthis case is inextricably tied to his 1990 conviction. But this does not lead to the conclusion that\nnew legal consequences have been added to that conviction. In Callon, the enhancement was\nsimilarly tied to the defendant’s preceding impaired-driving conviction, but the consequences\nwere added to his subsequent OUIL/UBAL offense. See Callon, 256 Mich App at 319.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fTherefore, the recapture provision found in MCL 28.723(1)(e) does not violate the Ex Post Facto\nClauses of the state and federal Constitutions.4\n\n                          III. CRUEL OR UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT\n\n       Defendant next argues that requiring him to register as a sex offender constitutes cruel or\nunusual punishment. We disagree.\n\n       As stated above, we review de novo issues of constitutional law. Temelkoski, 307 Mich\nApp at 246. Defendant, as the party challenging SORA, bears the burden of proving that it is\nunconstitutional. Id. at 247.\n\n       Article I, § 16 of the Michigan Constitution prohibits the infliction of cruel or unusual\npunishment.5 A threshold question in this case, of course, is whether registration constitutes\npunishment at all. See Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 250-251. We have repeatedly held that sex\noffender registration does not constitute punishment because the registry is designed to protect\nthe public rather than punish the offender.

Therefore, we reject amicus’s argument.\n5\n  The Eight Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the infliction of cruel and\nunusual punishment. US Const, Am VIII.

Id. at 140. Under SORA as it existed at that time, the defendant was required to\nregister as a sex offender. Id. However, under amendments to SORA that went into effect on\nOctober 1, 2004, if the defendant had been placed on HYTA status on or after October 1, he\nwould not have been required to register as a sex offender. Id. at 141. The defendant was\nsuccessfully discharged from HYTA status and petitioned to be removed from the sex offender\nregistry. Id. at 140. This Court held that the defendant’s registration as a sex offender\nconstituted cruel or unusual punishment as applied to him. Id. at 156. In 2011, however, SORA\nwas amended to include “a consent exception . . . that provides some youthful offenders relief in\nsituations involving consensual sex acts.” Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 261.

Dipiazza, 286 Mich App at 142. Offenders were required to register\nfor 25 years for their first offense and for life for a second or subsequent offense committed after\nOctober 1, 1995.

THE MENDOZA-MARTINEZ FACTORS\n\n        Determining whether a statutory scheme imposes punishments requires a two-step\ninquiry. Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 258. First, the Court must determine whether the\nLegislature intended the statute to be punitive. Id. If the intent was to punish, the inquiry is\ncomplete. Id. But “if the Legislature intended to enact a civil remedy, the court must also\nascertain whether the statutory scheme is so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the\nState’s] intention to deem it civil.” Id. (citations and quotation marks omitted; alteration in\nTemelkoski). To do so, the Court looks to the seven factors enunciated in Kennedy v Mendoza-\nMartinez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106534\"><a href=\"/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 259.\nThose factors are as follows:\n\n       “[1] Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, [2]\n       whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, [3] whether it comes\n       into play only on a finding of scienter, [4] whether its operation will promote the\n       traditional aims of punishment—retribution and deterrence, [5] whether the\n       behavior to which it applies is already a crime, [6] whether an alternative purpose\n       to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and [7] whether it\n       appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.” [People v\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f       Earl, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44; 845 NW2d 721 (2014), quoting Mendoza-Martinez, 372\n       US at 168-169 (alterations in Earl).]\n\nThese seven factors serve as “useful guideposts” and are “neither exhaustive nor dispositive.”\nEarl, 495 Mich at 44 Further, a party asserting that a statutory scheme imposes punishment\nmust provide “ ‘the clearest proof’ ” that the scheme “ ‘is so punitive either in purpose or effect\nto negate the . . . intention to deem it civil.’ ” Id., quoting Kansas v Hendricks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 361;\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118136\"><a href=\"/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Indeed, the Legislature explicitly stated that its intent was not to impose\npunishment. MCL 28.721a. Based largely on this statement of purpose, this Court has\n“conclude[d] that the Legislature intended SORA as a civil remedy to protect the health and\nwelfare of the public.” Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 262. Therefore, it is necessary to look to\nthe Mendoza-Martinez factors to determine whether the school safety zones and in-person\nreporting requirements are so punitive in purpose or effect that they negate the Legislature’s\nintent to deem them civil. See id. at 262. In this endeavor, we first find instructive the United\nStates Supreme Court’s application of the Mendoza-Martinez factors to the Alaska sex offender\nregistration statute in Smith v Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"127899\"><a href=\"/opinion/127899/smith-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

SMITH\n\n        Smith “is the preeminent case holding that a sex offender registration and notification\nlaw, as applied to an adult defendant, is not a form of punishment.” Temelkoski, 307 Mich App\nat 263. The Supreme Court applied the Mendoza-Martinez factors and determined that the\nAlaska sex offender registration statute, Alaska Stat § 12.63.010 et seq., did not constitute\npunishment for ex post facto purposes. Smith, 538 US at 97-106.\n\n                      1. AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OR RESTRAINT\n\n        The Smith Court first observed that sex offender registration does not resemble\nimprisonment, “the paradigmatic affirmative disability or restraint.” Smith, 538 US at 100. The\nCourt noted that the Alaska statute did “not restrain activities sex offenders may pursue but\nleaves them free to change jobs or residences.” Id. The Court also reasoned that although\nregistration may negatively affect offenders, such as in finding housing and employment, “these\nconsequences flow not from the Act’s registration and dissemination provisions, but from the\nfact of conviction, already a matter of public record.” Id. at 101. Finally, the Court noted that\noffenders were not required to register in person. Id.\n\n        The Court also rejected the contention that registration is akin to probation or supervised\nrelease, although it acknowledged that the argument “has some force.” Id. at 101. The Court\nexplained that “[p]robation and supervised release entail a series of mandatory conditions and\nallow the supervising officer to seek the revocation of probation or release in case of infraction.”\nId. Sex offenders, on the other hand, were “free to move where they wish and to live and work\nas other citizens, with no supervision.” Id. And although registrants were required to “inform\nthe authorities after they change their facial features (such as growing a beard), borrow a car, or\nseek psychiatric treatment, they [were] not required to seek permission to do so.” Id. Further,\n\n                                                -8-\n\falthough offenders faced criminal penalties for failing to comply with reporting requirements,\nsuch penalties arose from proceedings that were separate from their underlying offense. Id. at\n101-102.\n\n                               2. HISTORICAL PUNISHMENTS\n\n        The Court found any resemblance between sex offender registration and historical\nshaming punishments “misleading.” Smith, 538 US at 97-98. “Punishments such as whipping,\npillory, and branding,” the Court explained, “inflicted physical pain and staged a direct\nconfrontation between the offender and the public.” Id. at 98. Conversely, the stigma attached\nto a registered sex offender “results not from public display for ridicule and shaming but from\nthe dissemination of accurate information about a criminal record, most of which is already\npublic.” Id. The Court reasoned, “Our system does not treat dissemination of truthful\ninformation in furtherance of a legitimate governmental objective as punishment.” Id. The\nCourt also stated that adverse effects felt by registrants, such as “mild personal embarrassment”\nand “social ostracism” were not “an integral part of the objective of the regulatory scheme.” Id.\nat 99.\n\n        The Court added that “[t]he fact that Alaska posts the information on the Internet d[id]\nnot alter [its] conclusion.” Smith, 538 US at 99. “The purpose and the principal effect of\nnotification are to inform the public for its own safety, not to humiliate the offender,” the Court\nexplained. Id. “Widespread public access is necessary for the efficacy of the scheme, and the\nattendant humiliation is but a collateral consequence of a valid regulation.” Id. “The process is\nmore analogous,” the Court stated, “to a visit to an official archive of criminal records than it is\nto a scheme forcing an offender to appear in public with some visible badge of past criminality.”\nId. The Court also observed that the registry was passive, as a member of the public must seek\nout the information on the website. Id. The Court further noted that Alaska’s website did not\nallow the public to shame an offender by, for example, “posting comments underneath his\nrecord.” Id.\n\n                                          3. SCIENTER\n\n       The Smith Court found this factor to be “of little weight” without extended explanation.\nSmith, 538 US at 105.\n\n    4. TRADITIONAL AIMS OF PUNISHMENT: DETERRENCE AND RETRIBUTION\n\n        The Court stated that it was undisputed that the sex offender registry could potentially\ndeter crime. Smith, 538 US at 102. But the Court noted that “[a]ny number of governmental\nprograms might deter crime without imposing punishment.” Id. The Court reasoned, “ ‘To hold\nthat the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions “criminal” . . . would\nseverely undermine the Government’s ability to engage in effective regulation.’ ” Id., quoting\nHudson v United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118155\"><a href=\"/opinion/118155/hudson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118155\"><a href=\"/opinion/118155/hudson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997).\n\n        The Court also disagreed with the proposition that registration was retributive because the\nlength of time that an offender was required to register “appear[ed] to be measured by the extent\nof the wrongdoing, not by the extent of the risk posed.” Smith, 538 US at 102 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). Although the Court acknowledged that the statute “differentiate[d]\n                                                -9-\n\fbetween individuals convicted of aggravated or multiple offenses and those convicted of a single\nnonaggravated offense,” it found that such “broad categories” and the “corresponding length of\nthe reporting requirement” were “reasonably related to the danger of recidivism,” which was\n“consistent with the regulatory objective.” Id.\n\n                                   5. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR\n\n        Along with the scienter factor, the Court found this factor to be “of little weight.” Smith,\n538 US at 105. “The regulatory scheme applies only to past conduct, which was, and is, a\ncrime,” the Court explained. Id. The Court stated that this was “a necessary beginning point, for\nrecidivism is the statutory concern.” Id. The Court added that “[t]he obligations the statute\nimpose[d] are the responsibility of registration, a duty not predicated upon some present or\nrepeated violation.” Id.\n\n               6. RATIONAL CONNECTION TO A NONPUNITIVE PURPOSE\n\n        The Court held that this was the most significant factor in its determination. Smith, 538\nUS at 102. The Court stated that the Alaska sex offender registration statute had “a legitimate\nnonpunitive purpose of public safety, which is advanced by alerting the public to the risk of sex\noffenders in their communit[y].” Id. at 102-103 (quotation marks and citation omitted; alteration\nin Smith). According to the Court, the respondents acknowledged that this purpose was valid\nand rational. Id. at 103. They argued, however, that the statute “lack[ed] the necessary\nregulatory connection because it [was] not narrowly drawn to accomplish the stated purpose.”\nId. (quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court rejected that argument and stated, “A\nstatute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit with the nonpunitive\naims it seeks to advance.” Id.\n\n                                      7. EXCESSIVENESS\n\n        The Smith Court rejected the contention that the statute was excessive because it applied\nto all convicted sex offenders without individual determinations of dangerousness. Smith, 538\nUS at 103. “Alaska could conclude that a conviction for a sex offense provides evidence of\nsubstantial risk of recidivism,” the Court reasoned. Id. The Court found this to be “consistent\nwith grave concerns over the high rate of recidivism among convicted sex offenders and their\ndangerousness as a class.” Id. The Court noted that “[t]he risk of recidivism posed by sex\noffenders is ‘frightening and high.’ ” Id., quoting McKune v Lile, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121146\"><a href=\"/opinion/121146/mckune-v-lile/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121146\"><a href=\"/opinion/121146/mckune-v-lile/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). The Court stated, “The Ex Post Facto Clause does not preclude a State\nfrom making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail\nparticular regulatory consequences.” Smith, 538 US at 103. The Court further explained that a\nlegislature has the power to fashion “a rule of universal application.” Id. at 104 (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). “The State’s determination to legislate with respect to convicted sex\noffenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of their dangerousness, does not\nmake the statute a punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.” Id. The Court stated that\nAlaska was permitted to “dispense with individual predictions of future dangerousness and allow\nthe public to assess the risk on the basis of accurate, nonprivate information about the registrants’\nconvictions without” thereby imposing punishment. Id.\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\f        The Court also rejected the argument that the duration of the reporting requirements was\nexcessive. Id. at 104. The Court relied on empirical research, which showed that most child\nmolesters who reoffend do so not within the first several years after they were released but “ ‘as\nlate as 20 years following release.’ ” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n        The Court likewise rejected the contention that the registry was excessive because of its\nwide dissemination. Smith, 538 US at 104. The Court reiterated that the registry was passive\nbecause “[a]n individual must seek access to the information.” Id. at 105. The Alaska website\nalso warned “that the use of displayed information to commit a criminal act against another\nperson is subject to criminal prosecution.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Given\nthe general mobility of our population,” the Court reasoned, “for Alaska to make its registry\nsystem available and easily accessible throughout the State was not so excessive a regulatory\nrequirement as to become a punishment.” Id. The Court stated that determining excessiveness\n“is not an exercise in determining whether the legislature has made the best choice possible to\naddress the problem it seeks to remedy,” but “whether the regulatory means chosen are\nreasonable in light of the nonpunitive objective.” Id. The Court concluded that the Alaska\nstatute met that standard. Id.\n\n     D. APPLICATION OF THE MENDOZA-MARTINEZ FACTORS TO SCHOOL SAFETY\n               ZONES AND IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        This Court in Temelkoski generally endorsed the analysis in Smith. Temelkoski, 307\nMich App at 262-270. As noted, however, the Michigan SORA has changed substantially since\nit was first enacted in 1994. Further, given recent amendments, it is also markedly different from\nthe statute reviewed by the United States Supreme Court in Smith in 2003. Although defendant\nargues that SORA as a whole is unconstitutional, he primarily takes issue with the school safety\nzones and in-person reporting requirements. Temelkoski did not address these particular\nprovisions, although it generally held that sex offender registration does not impose punishment.\nId. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the sex offender registration does not impose\npunishment and focus on whether the school safety zones and in-person reporting requirements\nare punitive in purpose or effect using the Mendoza-Martinez factors.10\n\n                      1. AFFIRMATIVE DISABILITY OF RESTRAINT\n\n                                 a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n\n\n\n10\n   The prosecution relies heavily on Doe v Snyder, 932 F Supp 2d 803, 811-814 (ED Mich,\n2013), in which the court purportedly held that the recent amendments to SORA did not make\nthe scheme punitive in effect. The court stated that the new provisions had “repeatedly been\nupheld.” Id. at 811. However, the court relied on cases from 1999 and 2000 for that proposition,\nand the school safety zone and in-person reporting provisions were added after those cases were\ndecided. See id. Therefore, we find that decision unpersuasive.\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\f        Some state courts have concluded that school safety zones impose an affirmative\ndisability or restraint on sex offenders.11 The Supreme Court of Indiana, addressing a similar\nprovision barring sex offenders from residing within 1,000 feet of school property, held that such\na restriction “is neither minor nor indirect.” State v Pollard, 908 NE2d 1145, 1147, 1150 (Ind,\n2009). The Indiana law, however, did not include a grandfather provision, and thus barred\nregistrants from living within 1,000 feet of a school even if the registrant had lived there before\nthe law was passed. Id. at 1150. The law also required a registrant to change residences if a\nschool or youth program center opened within 1,000 feet of the registrant’s residence. Id.\n\n        The Supreme Court of Kentucky, addressing a provision disallowing sex offenders from\nliving within 1,000 feet of a school, stated that it found it “difficult to imagine that being\nprohibited from residing within certain areas does not qualify as an affirmative disability or\nrestraint.” Commonwealth v Baker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2007417\"><a href=\"/opinion/2007417/com-v-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439-441, 445 (Ky, 2009). Similar to the\nIndiana law, a registrant in Kentucky “face[d] a constant threat of eviction” because he or she\nwould be forced to move if a school opened upon within 1,000 feet of his or her home. Id.\n\n        But other courts have held to the contrary. The Supreme Court of Iowa, addressing a\nstatute prohibiting sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of a school, recognized that such a\nprovision “clearly impose[s] a form of disability.” State v Seering, 701 NW2d 655, 659, 668\n(Iowa, 2005). But the court held that “the disabling nature of the statute is not absolute.” Id.\nThe court added, “[W]e are mindful of the objectives of the residency restriction under the\nstatute and understand that a statute that imposes some degree of disability does not necessarily\nmean the state is imposing punishment.” Id.\n\n        We agree with the reasoning of the Indiana and Kentucky courts. Prohibiting registrants\nfrom living and working in many areas is undoubtedly an affirmative restraint. Further, the\ngrandfather clause in Michigan is limited, as it only applies to residences where the offenders\nwere living before January 1, 2006. MCL 28.735(3)(c). If that clause does not apply and a\nperson who lives in a school safety zone commits a sex offense and is required to register, he or\nshe will be forced to leave his or her home. MCL 28.735(4). Therefore, rather than merely\nrestraining sex offenders, the school safety zone may expel offenders in certain circumstances.\nAlso, offenders who are not protected by the grandfather clause face the constant prospect that\nthey will be forced to move if a new school opens near their home. Unlike in Smith, offenders\nunder the current Michigan SORA are not entirely free to change residences or jobs given the\nstudent safety zone provisions. Although we agree with the Seering Court that such a restraint is\nnot “absolute,” it is a restraint nonetheless. See Seering, 701 NW2d at 659.\n\n\n\n\n11\n  Cases from foreign jurisdictions are not binding on this Court, but may be persuasive.

IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Some state courts have also concluded that frequent in-person reporting requirements\nimpose an affirmative disability or restraint. The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine held that a\nsimilar provision requiring quarterly, in-person reporting “place[d] substantial restrictions on the\nmovements of lifetime registrants and may work an impractical impediment that amounts to an\naffirmative disability.” State v Letalien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2056690\"><a href=\"/opinion/2056690/state-v-letalien/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 37; 985 A2d 4 (2009) (quotation marks\nand citation omitted). Distinguishing the reporting requirement at issue in Smith, the court stated\nthat the requirement of quarterly, in-person reporting for life “is undoubtedly a form of\nsignificant supervision by the state.” Id. “[I]t belies common sense,” the court concluded, “to\nsuggest that a newly imposed lifetime obligation to report to a police station every ninety days to\nverify one’s identification, residence, and school, and to submit to fingerprinting[12] and provide\na current photograph,[13] is not a substantial disability or restraint on the free exercise of\nindividual liberty.” Id. at ¶ 56. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire recently endorsed the\nLetalien Court’s reasoning. Doe v State, 167 NH 382, 405; 111 A3d 1077 (2015).\n\n       The Supreme Court of Oklahoma adopted the same reasoning regarding its similar in-\nperson reporting requirements. Starkey v Oklahoma Dep’t of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 49;\n305 P3d 1004 (2013). Like defendant in the case at hand, the defendant in Starkey would have\nbeen required, under threat of prosecution, “to make an ‘in person’ appearance every 90 days for\nlife and every time he moves, changes employment, changes student status, or resides\nsomewhere for 7 consecutive days or longer.” Id. See also MCL 28.725a(3)(c); MCL 28.725(1).\nThe Supreme Court of Oklahoma deemed these requirements “significant and intrusive.”\nStarkey, 2013 OK at ¶ 49.\n\n        But other courts have disagreed. United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in\nUnited States v Parks, 698 F3d 1, 5-6 (CA 1, 2012), held that although periodic in-person\nreporting is inconvenient, such “inconvenience is surely minor compared to the disadvantages of\nthe underlying scheme in its consequences for renting housing, obtaining work and the like—\nconsequences that were part of the package that Smith itself upheld.” The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit in United States v WBH, 664 F3d 848, 857 (CA 11, 2011),\nlikewise held that quarterly in-person reporting “may be more inconvenient, but requiring it is\nnot punitive.”\n\n       We agree with the reasoning of the Maine and Oklahoma courts. The reporting\nrequirements in Michigan are onerous. Reporting requirements vary by “tier,” and Tier III\noffenders such as defendant are required to report in person four times a year for life. MCL\n\n\n\n12\n     The Michigan SORA requires fingerprinting only once. MCL 28.727(1)(q).\n13\n  Under the Michigan SORA, registrants must have a new photograph taken if “[t]he officer or\nauthorized employee” determines that the registrant’s preexisting photograph does not “match[]\nthe appearance of the individual sufficiently to properly identify him or her from that\nphotograph.” MCL 28.725a(5).\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f28.725a(3). In addition, MCL 28.725(1) provides, in part, that all registrants must report in\nperson after any of the following events occur:\n\n               (a) The individual changes or vacates his or her residence or domicile.\n\n             (b) The individual changes his or her place of employment, or\n       employment is discontinued.\n\n              (c) The individual enrolls as a student with an institution of higher\n       education, or enrollment is discontinued.\n\n               (d) The individual changes his or her name.\n\n               (e) The individual intends to temporarily reside at any place other than his\n       or her residence for more than 7 days.\n\n              (f) The individual establishes any electronic mail or instant message\n       address, or any other designations used in internet communications or postings.\n\n             (g) The individual purchases or begins to regularly operate any vehicle,\n       and when ownership or operation of the vehicle is discontinued.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court in Smith noted that the scheme in that case did not impose a\ndisability or restraint because offenders were not required to report in person. Smith, 538 US at\n101. In contrast, under the current Michigan SORA, offenders are required to report in person\nup to four times a year and after any of the events listed in MCL 28.725a occurs. Many of the\nevents listed in MCL 28.725a(3) may occur frequently in the life of an average person. Thus, the\nin-person reporting requirements strike us as more than a mere inconvenience. Rather, we\nconclude that they amount to an affirmative disability or restraint. See id.\n\n                               2. HISTORICAL PUNISHMENTS\n\n                                 a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n        Some courts have concluded that school safety zones are analogous to historical\npunishments. The Pollard Court stated that “restrictions on living in certain areas is not an\nuncommon condition of probation or parole.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1151. Courts have also\ncompared the restrictions to banishment. “Banishment” is defined as “ ‘a punishment inflicted\nupon criminals, by compelling them to quit a city, place, or country, for a specific period of time,\nor for life.’ ” United States v Ju Toy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96296\"><a href=\"/opinion/96296/united-states-v-ju-toy/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269-270; </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96296\"><a href=\"/opinion/96296/united-states-v-ju-toy/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1905)\n(citation omitted). The Baker Court found that the restrictions that prevented offenders from\nliving in certain areas and that expelled offenders from their homes were “decidedly similar to\nbanishment.” Baker, 295 SW3d at 444. The Starkey Court concurred with that reasoning.\nStarkey, 2013 OK at ¶ 60.\n\n        But other courts have denied that registration is similar to banishment. The Supreme\nCourt of Iowa stated that although the defendant “may have a sense of being banished to another\narea of the city, county, or state,” registration did not amount to “true banishment,” which “goes\n\n                                               -14-\n\fbeyond the mere restriction of ‘one’s freedom to go or remain where others have the right to be:\nit often works a destruction on one’s social, cultural, and political existence.’ ” Seering, 701\nNW2d at 667, quoting Poodry v Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians, 85 F3d 874, 897 (CA 2,\n1996). The court added that “[o]ffenders are not banished from communities and are free to\nengage in most community activities.” Id. at 667.\n\n        We agree with the reasoning in Pollard and Baker that the restrictions created by the\nschool safety zone provisions resemble banishment. Unlike in Smith, registrants are\naffirmatively barred from living in certain areas. Also, unless offenders are protected by the\nlimited grandfather provision, they can be expelled from their residences as a consequence of\nregistration. Although admittedly not true banishment, we find the similarity undeniable.\nFurther, restrictions on where an offender can live or work are common conditions of probation\nor supervised release. Smith, 538 US at 101. Therefore, we believe that the restrictions imposed\nby the school safety zones have historically been regarded as a punishment.\n\n                       b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n       Cases addressing in-person reporting requirements have focused on the similarity to\nprobation and parole. The Supreme Court of Indiana concluded that in-person reporting was\n“comparable to conditions of supervised probation or parole.” Wallace v State, 905 NE2d 371,\n376, 380 (Ind, 2009). However, the Wyoming Supreme Court disagreed that in-person reporting\nrequirements were similar to probation or parole, relying on Smith. Kammerer v State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2670499\"><a href=\"/opinion/2670499/ronald-s-kammerer-jr-v-the-state-of-wyoming/\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span>\n<span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 22; 322 P3d 827 (Wy, 2014). The court denied that registration was similar to\n“monitoring . . . imposed under supervised probation or parole.” Id.\n\n        Many of the considerations noted by Smith still apply to the current Michigan SORA.\nSex offenders are not required to seek permission to do many things, such as change residences\nor cars, but are only required to report such changes. Also, penalties for failing to comply with\nSORA arise from proceedings separate from the offender’s underlying offense. But the scheme\nexamined in Smith did not entail in-person reporting. As stated, defendant, as a Tier III offender,\nmust report in person four times each year for the rest of his life, MCL 28.725a(3)(c), as well as\nupon the occurrence of any events listed in MCL 28.725(1). This is far more intrusive than the\nreporting requirements in Smith and imposes a great amount of supervision by the state. We\nagree with the Wallace Court that such demanding in-person reporting requirements are at least\n“comparable to conditions of supervised probation or parole.” See Wallace, 905 NE2d at 380.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -15-\n\f                                          3. SCIENTER\n\n        This Court has declined to consider this factor in assessing whether sex offender\nregistration constitutes punishment. Temelkoski, 307 Mich App at 262.14 We therefore decline\nto address the factor. See id.\n\n     4. TRADITIONAL AIMS OF PUNISHMENT: DETERRENCE AND RETRIBUTION\n\n                                 a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n        Some courts have concluded that school safety zones promote deterrence and retribution\nto such a degree that they are punitive. The court in Pollard stated that such restrictions are\n“apparently designed to reduce the likelihood of future crimes by depriving the offender of the\nopportunity to commit those crimes.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1152. The court determined that the\nprovision was “an even more direct deterrent to sex offenders than the . . . registration and\nnotification regime.” Id. The court in Baker found that such restrictions are retributive given\nthat there was “no individualized determination of the dangerousness of a particular registrant.”\nBaker, 295 SW3d at 444. The court noted that “[e]ven those registrants whose victims were\nadults are prohibited from living near an area where children gather.” Id. “When a restriction is\nimposed equally upon all offenders, with no consideration given to how dangerous any particular\nregistrant may be to public safety,” the court concluded, “that restriction begins to look far more\nlike retribution for past offenses than a regulation intended to prevent future ones.” Id. The\ncourt in Starkey essentially adopted the same reasoning. Starkey, 2013 OK at ¶ 66. Courts\nconcluding to the contrary have relied on the statement from Smith that government programs\ncan deter crime without imposing punishment. See, e.g., Seering, 701 NW2d at 668; Kammerer,\n2014 WY at ¶¶ 26.\n\n        The primary reason for the creation of the school safety zones is the desire to specifically\ndeter future sexual offenses by registrants. As in Pollard, it appears that the provisions were\n“designed to reduce the likelihood of future crimes by depriving the offender of the opportunity\nto commit those crimes.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1152. Nonetheless, the disclaimer from Smith\nstill applies: “[a]ny number of governmental programs might deter crime without imposing\npunishment.” Smith, 538 US at 102. But the school safety zone provisions are unlike the statute\nat issue in Smith. In that case, the Alaska statute was a passive notification scheme designed to\nallow members of the public to protect themselves from sex offenders. In this case, the school\nsafety zone provisions are not passive. Rather, registrants are specifically prohibited them from\nliving, working, and loitering in many areas. We agree with the observation of the Pollard Court\nthat school safety zones are “an even more direct deterrent to sex offenders than the . . .\nregistration and notification regime.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1152. In sum, we find that the\nforemost purpose of the school safety zones is deterrence.\n\n\n\n14\n   We note that other courts have concluded that because most sex offenses require a finding of\nscienter, this factor counsels in favor of deeming registration punishment. See, e.g., Doe v State,\n189 P3d 999, 1012-1013 (Alas, 2008).\n\n\n                                               -16-\n\f       However, we disagree that the school safety zones are necessarily retributive. Although\nthe observations of the Baker Court have some merit, we are mindful of the admonition that the\nLegislature is permitted to legislate with regard to sex offenders as a class without individual\ndeterminations of future dangerousness. See Smith, 538 US at 103. It is the province of the\nLegislature to determine that all sex offenders, regardless of their offenses, should be segregated\nfrom children. While one can reasonably question the usefulness of such a broadly sweeping\nmeasure, “[a] statute is not deemed punitive simply because it lacks a close or perfect fit with the\nnonpunitive aims it seeks to advance.” Id. Therefore, we cannot say that the school safety zones\nhave the purpose or effect of promoting retribution. See id.\n\n                       b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Cases have not extensively addressed whether in-person reporting requirements promote\ndeterrence and retribution. The requirements are designed to ensure that the information\nprovided on the registry is accurate and up-to-date. Accurate and up-to-date information is\nessential to “monitoring those persons” who the “legislature has determined . . . pose[] a\npotential serious menace and danger to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the people, and\nparticularly the children, of this state.” MCL 28.721a. Therefore, we cannot conclude that such\nmeasures necessarily promote deterrence or retribution. Still, we acknowledge that more\nrigorous reporting requirements could promote deterrence and retribution. If, for example,\noffenders were required to report in person twice daily, such onerous requirements could begin\nto appear less useful to promoting the regulatory goals of SORA and more like deterrence and\nretribution. However, the reporting requirements are not so extreme. Tier III offenders, those\nsubjected to the most reporting requirements, are only required to report four times each year, as\nwell as upon the occurrence of any events listed in MCL 28.725(1). See MCL 28.725a(3)(c).\nAlthough certainly burdensome for the offenders, we cannot say that these requirements promote\ndeterrence or retribution to such an extent that they are punitive. See id.\n\n                                   5. CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR\n\n        Like the United States Supreme Court, this Court has declined to consider this factor in\nassessing whether sex offender registration constitutes punishment. Temelkoski, 307 Mich App\nat 262.15 Therefore, we decline to address this factor. See id.\n\n              6. RATIONAL CONNECTION TO A NONPUNITIVE PURPOSE\n\n        As defendant admits, nearly every court has held that sex offender registration laws serve\na nonpunitive purpose of public safety. However, defendant questions whether the connection is\nrational. He calls attention to law review articles that advance the proposition that registration\n\n\n15\n  We note that the Alaska Supreme Court in Doe concluded that because registration laws only\napply to convicted sex offenders and not “other individuals who may pose a threat to society\neven if they were not convicted,” the effect was punitive. Doe, 189 P3d at 1014-1015. For\nexample, registration laws do not apply to “defendants whose convictions are overturned for\nreasons other than insufficiency of evidence of guilt.” Id. at 1015.\n\n\n                                               -17-\n\flaws do not reduce recidivism and that sex offenders, as a class, are not prone to recidivism.\nWhile perhaps true that in certain circumstances the school safety zones and in-person reporting\nrequirements do more harm than good, we cannot conclude that they are irrational measures for\naccomplishing the stated regulatory purpose of SORA. Further, we are not charged with\ndetermining the wisdom of these measures. Such questions are for the Legislature to decide.\nPeople v Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2058750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2058750/people-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 470; 772 NW2d 820 (2009) (noting that the wisdom of a\npolicy is a political question). Similarly, it is the Legislature that is charged with the authority to\nrevisit, if it so chooses, the efficacy of the legislation. See id.\n\n        To the extent that defendant and amicus argue that the recapture provision is not rational\nas applied to defendant given that defendant’s last sex offense conviction was 25 years ago, we\nmust disagree. The argument has some merit, but we cannot conclude that requiring defendant\nto register as a sex offender is wholly irrational. Although defendant’s sex offense conviction\nwas 25 years ago, he committed another felony in 2013, and has “shown a general tendency to\nrecidivate.” See People v Fredericks, 2014 Ill App 122122, ¶ 60; 383 Ill Dec 293; 14 NE3d 576\n(2014).\n\n                                       7. EXCESSIVENESS\n\n                                  a. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n       Some courts have held that the broad application of student safety zones is excessive.\nThe Supreme Court of Indiana in Pollard stated, “Restricting the residence of offenders based on\nconduct that may have nothing to do with crimes against children, and without considering\nwhether a particular offender is a danger to the general public, the statute exceeds its non-\npunitive purposes.” Pollard, 908 NE2d at 1153. The Supreme Court of Kentucky likewise\nconcluded that given the magnitude of the restraint imposed by residency restrictions, the lack of\nindividual determinations of the future dangerousness of registrants rendered the restrictions\nexcessive. Baker, 295 SW3d at 446. Other courts have concluded to the contrary. The Supreme\nCourt of Iowa in Seering concluded that given “the special needs of children” and “the imprecise\nnature of protecting children from the risk that convicted sex offenders might reoffend,”\nresidency restrictions are not excessive. Seering, 701 NW2d at 668.\n\n        We find that the Supreme Court’s observations from Smith still apply. The Legislature is\n“not preclude[d] . . . from making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified\ncrimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.” Smith, 538 US at 103. The Court\nexplained that the legislature had the power to fashion “a rule of universal application.” Id. at\n104 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Further, “[t]he State’s determination to legislate\nwith respect to convicted sex offenders as a class, rather than require individual determination of\ntheir dangerousness, does not make the statute a punishment under the Ex Post Facto Clause.”\nId.\n\n       One can reasonably question the usefulness of prohibiting certain offenders from living\nand working within the zones even though their offenses were not committed against children.\nDespite these reservations, as we have already noted, the wisdom of a statute is a question for the\nLegislature. Wallace, 284 Mich App at 470. Moreover, the Legislature was not precluded from\n\n\n                                                 -18-\n\fmaking categorical judgments of this nature. Smith, 538 US at 103. Therefore, the school safety\nzones prohibition is not excessive.\n\n                        b. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Courts have not extensively addressed whether in-person reporting requirements are\nexcessive. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire found the lifetime duration of registration to\nbe excessive. Doe, 167 NH at 410. “If in fact there is no meaningful risk to the public, then the\nimposition of such requirements becomes wholly punitive.” Id. We disagree. Again, the\nLegislature is tasked with determining the risk posed by sex offenders. Moreover, although the\nin-person reporting requirements of the Michigan SORA are onerous, it is difficult to conclude\nthat they are necessarily excessive. Rather, as stated, they are reasonably designed to ensure that\nthe information on the registry is accurate and up-to-date. Therefore, the in-person reporting\nrequirements are not excessive.\n\n                                        E. CONCLUSION\n\n                                 1. SCHOOL SAFETY ZONES\n\n        As is apparent from our foregoing discussion, the Mendoza-Martinez factors point us in\nboth directions when it comes to school safety zones. We conclude that such zones impose\naffirmative restraints, resemble historical punishments, and promote deterrence. However, we\nalso conclude that they are rationally connected to the nonpunitive purpose of public safety and\nthat they are not excessive, as the Legislature is permitted to make the categorical judgment that\nsex offenders should not live, work, or loiter near schools. Weighing these factors, we are\nmindful that the burden lies with defendant to establish that school safety zones are punitive. As\nstated, a party asserting that a statutory scheme imposes punishment must provide “the clearest\nproof” that the scheme “ ‘is so punitive either in purpose or effect to negate the . . . intention to\ndeem it civil.’ ” Earl, 495 Mich at 44, quoting Hendricks, 521 US at 361 (alteration in Earl). In\nthis case, given that the Mendoza-Martinez factors cut both ways, we cannot conclude that\ndefendant has met his burden. Further, even some of the factors that weigh in defendant’s favor\nonly do so to a limited extent. The zones plainly restrict where offenders can live and work, but\nthe restriction is not absolute, and, therefore, the restrictions are distinguishable from true\nbanishment. And although the zones specifically deter the registered offenders, the Smith Court\nheld that even a deterrent purpose will not render a civil regulatory scheme punitive. Smith, 538\nUS at 102. Moreover, the nonpunitive purpose of the zones is the most important factor in\ndetermining whether they are punitive in effect. See id. Given these considerations, there is not\nthe clearest proof that the school safety zones are so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate the\nLegislature’s intent to deem them civil. See id.\n\n                        2. IN-PERSON REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n        Regarding the in-person reporting requirements, the Mendoza-Martinez factors do not\nreadily lead to one conclusion over the other. The requirements impose affirmative restraints\nand arguably resemble conditions of probation and supervised release. However, they do not\nnecessarily promote deterrence or retribution, they are rationally connected to the nonpunitive\npurpose of protecting the public by ensuring that the registry is accurate, and they are not\n\n                                                -19-\n\fexcessive. As with the school safety zones, we cannot find the clearest proof that they are\npunitive in effect given that the Mendoz-Martinez factors cut both ways. Further, we again find\nthat even some of the factors that weigh in defendant’s favor only do so to a limited extent.\nAlthough the reporting requirements are undeniably burdensome, their restraining effect is not\nabsolute. Registrants are not precluded from many activities, such as changing residences or\njobs, but are merely required to report them. And many of the considerations that Smith used to\ndistinguish sex offender registration from probation and supervised release still apply to the in-\nperson reporting requirements. Moreover, the nonpunitive purpose of the zones is the most\nimportant factor in determining whether they are punitive in effect. See Smith, 538 US at 102.\nGiven these considerations, we conclude that there is not the clearest proof that the in-person\nreporting requirements are so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate the Legislature’s intent to\ndeem them civil.\n\n\n\n                                       IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       We conclude that the recapture provision in MCL 28.723(1)(e) is constitutional. First,\nthe recapture provision found in MCL 28.723(1)(e) did not change the legal consequences of\ndefendant’s 1990 conviction. Rather, it attached legal consequences to his 2013 convictions.\nTherefore, that provision does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clauses of the state and federal\nConstitutions. Second, the school safety zones and in-person reporting requirements of SORA\ndo not constitute punishment. Therefore, they necessarily cannot constitute cruel or unusual\npunishment.\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n                                                             /s/ Joel P.
