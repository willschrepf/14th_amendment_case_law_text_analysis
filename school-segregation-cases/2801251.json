D-1-DC-06-904006\n                     THE 331ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT\n                               TRAVIS COUNTY\n\n       C OCHRAN, J., delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n       Appellant was convicted of the 2003 capital murder of Mel Cotton by stabbing her\n\nwith a knife 107 times in the course of attempting to commit or committing kidnapping or\n\nrobbery. Based upon the jury’s answers to the special punishment issues, the trial judge\n\nsentenced him to death. Appellant raises seven points of error. Finding no reversible error,\n\nwe affirm the judgment and sentence.\n\f                                                                           Gobert   Page 2\n\n                                  Factual Background\n\n       In the early hours of October 6, 2003, five-year-old Demetrius Cotton was awakened\n\nby the sound of his mother, Mel Cotton, screaming from her bedroom. He went into her\n\nroom and saw a strange man there–“kind of tall, bald, and buff.” He had a mustache and was\n\nwearing boots and boxers. He had gloves on his hands. Demetrius saw his mom sitting on\n\nthe edge of the bed with duct tape on her mouth; the man was standing in front of her,\n\nstabbing her in the arms with a sharp knife. She was trying to get away from him. She stood\n\nup, but then lost her balance and fell. The man kept stabbing, so Demetrius “ran over and\n\ntried to pull him down by his leg.” He said, “Stop,” but the man pushed him off, turned on\n\nthe bedside light and continued stabbing at his mom. The man told Demetrius, “sit down and\n\nshut up,” so Demetrius sat down. He was scared.\n\n       Then the man put duct tape on Demetrius’s ankles and mouth. He told Demetrius to\n\nget out of the room, so the child hopped out into the hallway. The man locked the door\n\nwhen Demetrius tried to get back inside the bedroom. He heard his mom scream, “Leave me\n\nalone,” but the man said, “Give me the money” and “Where is it at in your purse?”\n\nDemetrius hopped into his room and sat on a pallet of blankets beside his bed. He heard the\n\nman take his mom’s phone and “stomp on it” in the bathroom. The man also cut the\n\ntelephone cord.\n\n       Demetrius fell asleep, but he woke up when he heard the man come into his room.\n\nThe man “choked” Demetrius with both hands. Demetrius tried to scream, but he couldn’t.\n\f                                                                              Gobert    Page 3\n\nHe blacked out. When he woke up later, he had a hole in his chest with blood coming out.\n\nHe went to his mom’s room. She was laying on the floor on her side. Demetrius felt her\n\nneck. It was cold. “[S]he was gone.” He touched her hand and talked to her for a while.\n\nThen he went to the bathroom for a washcloth to stop his chest from bleeding. He looked\n\nto see if anyone else was there in the apartment. The man was gone. Demetrius ate a\n\npopsicle, then went back to his room, got his stuffed caterpillar, and waited for a long time\n\nfor someone to come. He fell asleep again, but woke up early that Monday morning when\n\nhe heard knocking on the door. He took his stool to the door to see out of the peephole, and\n\nwhen he saw his “Aunt Tweety,” he opened the door.\n\n       Monica Salinas, who lived in the same Austin apartment complex as Mel Cotton and\n\nDemetrius, heard a hysterical woman crying, “My sister is dead, my sister is dead, please help\n\nme.” She ran up the stairs, saw Demetrius with duct tape still around his neck and Mel\n\nCotton’s body in the master bedroom, so she called 911. She saw “blood everywhere and\n\nhandprints of blood all over the room.”\n\n       Paramedics rushed Demetrius to the hospital. He had four stab wounds in his chest.\n\nThey were so deep that a paramedic saw Demetrius’s lung inflating and deflating. Demetrius\n\nsaid that he could hear the air coming out of the hole in his chest; it sounded like “a farting\n\nnoise.” Demetrius lost twenty to thirty percent of his blood volume and had a pneumothorax\n\n(collapsed lung) and a pulmonary contusion. Doctors also determined that Demetrius had\n\nbeen strangled. Although his wounds were life-threatening, Demetrius recovered.\n\f                                                                                  Gobert     Page 4\n\n       The medical examiner testified that Mel Cotton had a total of 107 stab wounds that\n\nwere inflicted during a drawn-out attack. Thirty-eight of the wounds were centered around\n\nMs. Cotton’s left breast, indicating “some degree of [the victim’s] incapacitation or lack of\n\nmovement.” Another group of wounds were in her back. She had approximately thirteen\n\ndefensive wounds to her hands and arms. Twenty of the wounds reached her internal organs.\n\nShe, like Demetrius, had been strangled. The medical examiner said that Ms. Cotton had\n\nprobably been conscious for about ten to twenty minutes after her jugular vein had been cut.\n\n       Christina Pocharasang, appellant’s former girlfriend, learned of Ms. Cotton’s murder\n\nlater that day. She immediately suspected appellant. She testified that Ms. Cotton had\n\nhelped her move out of appellant’s apartment two weeks earlier by arranging for a man\n\nnamed Kenneth to haul her heavy furniture. Appellant had been furious and accused Ms.\n\nCotton and Kenneth of stealing his things, including his vacuum cleaner.1 Christina called\n\nappellant to ask him about the murder. When he answered the phone, appellant was\n\nbreathing heavily and said that he had been in a fight with Kenneth, who had stabbed him in\n\nthe stomach, causing an injury that required sixteen stitches. Christina then called the Austin\n\npolice to report her suspicions.\n\n       Austin police discovered that appellant had an outstanding parole-violation warrant\n\n\n       1\n         Appellant left numerous threatening voicemails for Christina, saying such things as\n“Yeah, ho, you go on and do what you like. I don’t give a f__ no more . But I bet you this one\nthing. You still got my shit, you keep that. That’s yours. Since you distributed my shit to all this\ndifferent mother f____ and shit. And gave my shit to these niggers. You gave my shit to these\nniggers. But bitch, one day you’re going to look up, and you’re going to see me. Bet that.”\n\f                                                                                  Gobert    Page 5\n\nand went to his apartment to arrest him. After peeking through his blinds, appellant refused\n\nto open the door, so the officers made a forced entry. Appellant did not have a stab wound\n\nin his stomach, but he did have cuts on his right hand that looked like those made when an\n\nattacker loses his grip on a knife shaft and cuts his own hand.\n\n       Officers obtained a search warrant for appellant’s apartment and car. They found\n\nstain remover, bleach, and vinegar containers; a glove on top of the washing machine; and\n\na glove, tennis shoes, and a striped shirt inside the washing machine. DNA consistent with\n\nthat of Ms. Cotton’s DNA was found on the left tennis shoe, and DNA consistent with that\n\nof appellant, Ms. Cotton, and an unknown male2 was found on the glove on top of the\n\nwashing machine. A latent fingerprint, matching appellant’s fingerprint, was found on Ms.\n\nCotton’s bedroom window blind.\n\n       While in jail, appellant bragged to his cellmate about stabbing Ms. Cotton and\n\nDemetrius. He recounted details of the crime, including wrapping Ms. Cotton in an\n\nextension cord, washing his bloody clothes, and throwing the knife that he used in a lake.3\n\n       Appellant called a jail guard, Deputy Tasha Lass, to testify that the inmates did not\n\nhave much privacy in their jail cells, thus suggesting that perhaps the cellmate could have\n\nlearned details about the murder from reading appellant’s case files in his jail cell.\n\n       Appellant also made numerous phone calls from the jail to family members,\n\n\n       2\n            When the DNA analysis was made, the technician did not have Demetrius’s DNA.\n       3\n            During his punishment-stage testimony, appellant confirmed that he threw the knife into\nthe lake.\n\f                                                                                      Gobert     Page 6\n\nsuggesting to one brother that he might remember that appellant and Mel Cotton had a sexual\n\nrelationship. Appellant’s older brother told appellant to stop asking him, his brother, and\n\ntheir mother to lie for him. These calls were recorded and played at trial.4 In them, appellant\n\ntold various versions of the events.\n\n        One of appellant’s brothers testified at trial to the version of events that appellant told\n\nhim. According to appellant, he and Mel Cotton had had sex that night, and then he went to\n\nsleep in her bed. She later woke him up, and they began arguing. She came at him with a\n\nknife, saying that she was going to shoot him with a gun. They struggled over the knife. He\n\ngot the knife, but when he tried to get dressed and leave, she attacked him again. Demetrius\n\ncame into the room and “fell” on the knife that his mother was holding. Appellant told his\n\nbrother that he had stayed with the little boy, giving him pain pills, until Demetrius’s aunt\n\narrived the next morning. Appellant told his family members that “wasn’t nothing wrong\n\nwith [Demetrius], he was–he’s alive and he wasn’t seriously hurt. . . . He wasn’t hurt bad at\n\nall. He went to school the next day.”\n\n        The jury found appellant guilty of capital murder.\n\n        During the punishment phase, the State introduced appellant’s prior convictions for\n\n\n\n        4\n           In one of them, appellant told his brother that a jury would surely sentence him to death\nif they heard that he had attacked and stabbed his mother when he was nineteen, so he wanted his\nmother to lie about that event. “I can’t have her up there. That’s, that’s suicide. . . . What am I\ngoing to look like in these folks’ eyes? . . . I mean it’s not about telling the truth, get up there and\ntell the truth, that’s suicide, man. . . . How can you say if you love somebody that you’re gonna\nsit up there and, and, and get up there and, and help go to the death chamber? That’s suicide for\nme, man.”\n\f                                                                              Gobert   Page 7\n\nburglary of a habitation, robbery, false imprisonment, assault, and dating-violence assault.\n\n       Christina Pocharasang testified again and recounted three different violent episodes.\n\nOne time, several months before the murder, appellant punched her in her face because she\n\ndid not want to cut her hair the way appellant wanted it cut. He chased her into the bathroom\n\nand kept hitting her for about thirty minutes. Then, about two weeks before the murder,\n\nappellant got angry when Christina asked him to go to his brother’s church. He closed the\n\nbedroom door so Christina’s son couldn’t see him, and he choked Christina with both hands\n\naround her neck. Christina decided to move out of town, and she contacted her friend, Mel\n\nCotton, who found Kenneth to help her move. But, in late September, Christina forgave\n\nappellant and came back to Austin. One night, appellant attacked her as she was driving. He\n\npunched her in the face five or six times, choked her neck, bit her on the shoulder,5 hit her\n\nin her lower back about fifteen times, and crushed her cell phone so she couldn’t call for\n\nhelp. He told Christina he was going to kill her. Christina finally escaped, drove to a\n\nhospital, and called the police. Nine days later, appellant killed Mel Cotton.\n\n       Another woman testified that she had dated appellant in 2002, but he got jealous and\n\nbegan hitting her and grabbing her by the neck when he was angry. She told him that she\n\nwanted nothing more to do with him. But one day he came over, and she got into his car to\n\ntalk to him. Appellant became angry again and, after she jumped out of his moving car, he\n\ncame after her and started hitting her in the face. Her father called the police and she filed\n\n\n\n       5\n           Six years later, Christina still had a scar from that bite.\n\f                                                                                  Gobert    Page 8\n\nassault charges against him.\n\n       A third woman testified that she had dated appellant when they were both in high\n\nschool. He was often verbally abusive to her, but one day he got jealous and hit her in the\n\nnose, then threatened to kill her as he forcibly took her back to his apartment. The next\n\nmorning she escaped by grabbing her car keys. She drove off, speeding and running red\n\nlights when she saw appellant driving behind her. She stopped, got out of her car and started\n\ncalling for help, but no one paid attention to her, so she raced back to her car. Appellant was\n\non the roof of her car. She nevertheless drove to a friend’s house, got out, and appellant\n\ndrove off in her car. Several years later, appellant found her in Round Rock, burglarized her\n\nfriend’s home, stole a TV and purse, and kidnapped her. The police eventually found her\n\nat appellant’s apartment, and he went to prison for burglary. She related another incident in\n\nwhich appellant choked her when he found out she was dating someone else. Even though\n\nappellant has been locked up in jail for years, she is still afraid that he will come back for her.\n\n       A former cellmate testified that appellant assaulted him while he was lying in his\n\nbunk. Appellant said that he was a Muslim and didn’t want to be in a cell with a Catholic.\n\nAppellant accused the cellmate of farting while appellant was praying, and then he began\n\nhitting the man in the chest, saying that he would kill him. The cellmate, in fear of his life,\n\nasked to be moved. Appellant had numerous instances of disruptive conduct while in jail\n\nand, at one point, was assessed fifteen days of administrative segregation for his actions.\n\n       A former female jailer who had given appellant special privileges resigned when her\n\f                                                                               Gobert    Page 9\n\nsuperiors discovered that she had been “fraternizing” with appellant. Thereafter, she visited\n\nappellant in jail seventeen times in six months.\n\n         Tasha Lass, the female jailer whom appellant had called to testify during the guilt\n\nstage, was called by the prosecution during the punishment stage. She admitted that she, too,\n\nhad been fraternizing with appellant for several weeks. She said that she had brought\n\nappellant a cell phone so he could call her from the jail without their conversations being\n\nrecorded. They talked on the phone every day, and appellant repeatedly told Deputy Lass\n\nthat he loved her. She testified that he was still talking to her every day on the smuggled cell\n\nphone.\n\n         Another jailer testified that, after Deputy Lass’s testimony, he had searched\n\nappellant’s jail cell and found the cell phone stuffed into a bag of Cheetos inside appellant’s\n\ncommissary bag. A cell phone charger was also found. Deputy Lass was then arrested and\n\ncharged with the felony of bringing a prohibited item into a correctional facility.\n\n         Yet another officer testified that a piece of plastic had been wedged into appellant’s\n\nleg brace that he was required to wear as he was transported each day from the jail to the\n\ncourtroom so that it would not lock. A different officer testified that appellant had tampered\n\nwith his leg brace on a second occasion as well. That time appellant was walking around in\n\nthe open courtroom with his leg brace unlocked.\n\n         After the defense offered several mitigation witnesses and rested, the State then\n\nrecalled Tasha Lass to testify about “an escape plan.” This time, Deputy Lass testified that\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 10\n\nshe had originally been a missionary in Romania, and then had traveled to Sri Lanka,\n\nAustralia, and England for eight years. She then became a police officer in Chattanooga,\n\nTennessee, and was named Patrol Officer of the Year in 2008. She moved to Austin, became\n\na deputy in June 2009, and first met appellant around Christmastime. She listened to him talk\n\nabout his case, his family, and his problems in jail. He made her feel “needed.” He told her\n\nabout his escape plan and wanted her to buy a storage shed so he could hide out “with food\n\nand stuff” until he escaped to Dubai. He chose Dubai because it is a Muslim country and he\n\ncould not be extradited from there. He also wanted her a buy a .45 pistol with a silencer and\n\nfour magazines and bring it into the jail “so he could shoot people and locks to get out.”\n\n       Appellant told Deputy Lass that he planned to call Deputy Fernandes over to his cell\n\nat 2:30 a.m., shoot him, drag the deputy’s body into the cell, change into his clothes, grab his\n\ncar keys,6 shoot any other inmates who saw him, kill the control-room operator,7 take the\n\nkeys to the fire closet, grab the bag inside that closet that contained a rope, then go to the top\n\nfloor fire closet for another rope, go out the roof door, tie the two ropes together and attach\n\none end to the building, toss the rope over the edge and climb down, run over to the parking\n\ngarage and drive off in Deputy Fernandes’s car. Appellant would “knock out” Deputy Lass\n\nand put her in the fire closet, but she did not believe that he would leave her alive. She said\n\nthat she did not want to aid in this escape plan, but appellant kept asking her every day.\n\n\n       6\n         Appellant told Ms. Lass that he had seen Deputy Fernandes drive in and out of the\nparking garage, so he knew which car was his and where it was parked.\n       7\n           Appellant wanted Ms. Lass to be in the control room so she could give him the keys.\n\f                                                                             Gobert    Page 11\n\n       The State also called Dr. Richard Coons who testified that, in his opinion, a\n\nhypothetical person with appellant’s history, conduct, and character would likely pose a\n\ndanger of violence in the future.\n\n       Finally, the defense called appellant to the witness stand. He admitted that he had hurt\n\na lot of women. He said that he had hit his brother over the head with a statue and beaten his\n\nmother and the women that he loved. It was because of “anger issues and situations. . . .\n\nMaybe sometimes I go overboard.”\n\n       Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, the trial judge sentenced appellant\n\nto death. After hearing a victim allocution statement by Mel Cotton’s sister, appellant\n\nshouted, “That bitch wasn’t no angel. That was a bitch, a motherf___ bitch. F___ all y’all.\n\nThat was a bitch a ho bitch.” When the trial judge attempted to interrupt, appellant said, “No,\n\nf__ you. F____ your allocution. F___ all you motherf____.”\n\n       Thus ended the trial of Milton Dwayne Gobert.\n\n                    The Admission of Evidence at the Punishment Phase\n\n       In two points of error, appellant complains of the admission of expert testimony\n\noffered at the punishment phase. In point of error one, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerred under Daubert,8 Kelly,9 Coble,10 and the Eighth Amendment in admitting testimony by\n\n\n\n       8\n           Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).\n       9\n           Kelly v. State, 824 S.W.2d 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).\n       10\n            Coble v. State, 330 S.W.3d 253 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\f                                                                                 Gobert     Page 12\n\nA.P. Merillat, an investigator from the Special Prosecution Unit of the Texas Department of\n\nCriminal Justice (TDCJ), concerning prison conditions and the opportunities for violence in\n\nTCDJ. The trial judge barred the prosecution from asking “about specific cases that he\n\nknows about” or other anecdotal stories, but otherwise allowed the State to develop Mr.\n\nMerillat’s testimony.\n\n       We have upheld the admission of Mr. Merillat’s educator-expertise testimony in\n\nseveral previous cases as reliable and relevant to the future-dangerousness issue concerning\n\nthe opportunities for violence in prison society.11 But in Estrada v. State,12 we found that Mr.\n\nMerillat’s unintentionally inaccurate testimony concerning reclassification of capital-murder\n\ninmates was, in that particular case, reversible error.13 Mr. Merillat did not repeat that factual\n\n\n       11\n           See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 287-89 (Merillat’s testimony about the Texas prison\nclassification system and violence in prison, offered to show a capital-murder defendant’s future\ndangerousness, was admissible as educator-expertise information designed to assist the jury;\ntestimony was confined to specific information about operations of Texas prison system and\ninmates’ opportunities for violence or productive behavior; the testimony was intended to\neducate the jury about an area in which it lacked a thorough understanding and to cast doubt\nupon the official prison data that the forensic psychologist who testified for defendant relied\nupon); Threadgill v.

We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion\n\nin overruling appellant’s Rule 702 objections.\n\n       Appellant also argues that the trial court’s admission of Mr. Merillat’s testimony\n\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to individualized sentencing because what other\n\nprisoners did or did not do in prison was not relevant to appellant. It was in response to that\n\nargument that the trial judge barred the prosecutor from asking Mr. Merillat any questions\n\nconcerning other inmates or their specific instances of conduct. But the judge concluded that\n\ngeneralized testimony concerning prison conditions, opportunities for violence, weapons\n\nused, and raw data concerning the number of violent acts in TDCJ did not violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment focus on individualized sentencing. Appellant asserts that Mr. Merillat’s\n\ntestimony “is that TDCJ is so grossly incompetent and so dangerous that the safety of all who\n\nenter there is in jeopardy.”14 We do not read Mr. Merillat’s testimony as implying that prison\n\n“is a relentless death trap” that imperils “the safety of all who enter there.” His point was\n\nthat TDCJ, like other prisons, cannot protect against all inmate violence.\n\n       We have previously upheld the admission of Mr. Merillat’s background testimony\n\n\n\n\nthere was a reasonable probability that the jury relied upon that testimony in reaching its verdict).\n       14\n            Appellant’s Brief at 12. Appellant goes on to assert that Mr. Merillat’s “relentless\nmessage is that TDCJ is a death trap, and the only way to make sure that Appellant does not add\nto it is to kill him, since TDCJ is totally ineffectual in safeguarding any of the many, many\npotential victims who work and enter there.” This may be one way of characterizing Mr.\nMerillat’s testimony, but it is certainly not a necessary one.\n\f                                                                                 Gobert     Page 14\n\nover an Eighth Amendment claim in an unpublished opinion.15 While the probative value\n\nof Mr. Merillat’s testimony pales in comparison to that concerning appellant’s specific acts\n\nof violence while incarcerated, its admission did not violate appellant’s Eighth Amendment\n\nright to an individualized sentencing procedure.           The jurors could make an Eighth\n\nAmendment “individualized” assessment of appellant’s likelihood to commit future acts of\n\nviolence based upon his specific actions–some of which he testified to himself–while\n\nincarcerated.16\n\n       We overrule appellant’s first point of error.\n\n       In his second point of error, appellant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting the\n\nopinion of Dr. Coons on the issue of future dangerousness. After a voir dire examination\n\noutside the presence of the jury appellant argued, inter alia, that Dr. Coons\n\n       does not have and has not propounded a sufficiently valid scientific technique\n       or theory that has been accepted as valid by the scientific community.\n\n\n       15\n          Espada v. State, No. AP-75,219, 2008 WL 4809235, *9-10 (Tex. Crim. App. Nov. 5,\n2008) (not designated for publication) (upholding admission of Merillat’s testimony about\nviolent acts and gangs in prison over defendant’s objection that the testimony was unfairly\nprejudicial and deprived him of the right to an individualized determination of his sentence).\n       16\n           Appellant testified and discussed his nine years in prison. He, like Mr. Merillat, talked\nabout the opportunities for violence in prison: “So violence is a part of life in prison, not saying\nthat you go inflict violence, because people that’s not part of a gang, like me, you don’t go\nlooking for trouble.” Appellant testified at length about prison gangs and noted that security had\nbeen “beefed up” since the Texas Seven escape. He knowledgeably discussed “crash gates,”\nsecurity guards, and the prison classification system. He talked about how he had gashed open\nthe back of another inmate with a hoe when he was in minimum custody. He said that he had\nhad five or six fights while in prison, and he “finished them all” but “ain’t nobody lost they life”\nin those fights. He stated that he told a female prison guard that he “would kick her bitch ass,”\nand he threatened to hit a prison guard with his hoe. Appellant also said that he had been in four\nor five fights while awaiting trial in the Travis County jail.\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 15\n\n               Psychiatry is not the study of prediction of future danger; it is, as he has\n       acknowledged, the study of mental disease and mental disorders. Future\n       dangerousness is not one of these. Basically his qualifications do not relate to\n       making such predictions.\n               He has failed to identify any scientific literature or documentation that\n       supports this technique, whatever technique he plans to use. . . .\n               Basically his testimony does not rely upon principles that are involved\n       in the field of psychiatry.\n\n       Appellant also filed a motion and brief outlining his reasons for excluding Dr. Coons’s\n\nopinion testimony under Rules 702-703, as well as the federal and Texas Constitutions. We\n\nconclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting Dr. Coons’s opinion on future\n\ndangerousness17 in this case for the same reasons that we held it inadmissible in Coble v.\n\nState.18 Here, as in that case, Dr. Coons provided no scientific, psychiatric, or psychological\n\nresearch or studies to support his idiosyncratic methodology for predicting whether a\n\nhypothetical person would commit future acts of violence.19\n\n       However, we conclude that the admission of Dr. Coons’s testimony was harmless\n\nerror.20 Given the overwhelming evidence of appellant’s life-long penchant for violence,\n\nthe circumstances of the capital murder, the evidence of his conspiracy to commit capital\n\n\n\n       17\n          Some of Dr. Coons’s testimony, such as that relating to “conduct disorder” as “the\njuvenile version of antisocial personality disorder,” a mental disorder described in the DSM-IV\nthat can cause a person to become violent, was relevant, sufficiently reliable, and admissible.\nOnly his “future dangerousness” opinion based on the lengthy hypothetical posed by the State\nwas insufficiently supported by a reliable methodology.\n       18\n            330 S.W.3d 253 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n       19\n            Id. at 277-80.\n       20\n            See TEX . R. APP.

The evidence in this case showed that, during prior\n\nperiods of incarceration, appellant had\n\n       !         attacked a fellow prison inmate with a hoe, gashing him in the back;\n\n       !         threatened to hit a prison guard with a hoe;\n\n       !         threatened to fight other prison guards;\n\n       !         gotten into “five or six” fights with fellow prison inmates;\n\n       !         gotten into “four or five” fights with fellow jail inmates;\n\n       !         developed inappropriate relationships with at least two female jail guards and\n                 manipulated them into providing him with contraband or special privileges;\n\n       !         plotted to murder a jailer and steal his car keys and car to effectuate appellant’s\n                 escape;\n\n       !         plotted to kill any other inmates or jailers who might witness that planned\n                 escape; and\n\n       !         manipulated his leg brace so that it could not lock and impede his mobility in\n                 the courtroom during his capital-murder trial.\n\n       Dr. Coons’s opinion concerning a hypothetical person in appellant’s position was, at\n\nmost, superfluous to the specific testimonial evidence of appellant’s proven dangerousness\n\n\n\n       21\n            See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 280.\n\f                                                                                 Gobert    Page 17\n\nboth in prison and in free society.\n\n       Furthermore, the State did not emphasize or rely upon Dr. Coons’s opinion in closing\n\nargument. One prosecutor briefly mentioned Dr. Coons and his methodology:\n\n               Now, remember the analysis that Dr. Coons uses when he is deciding\n       whether someone is going to be a future danger. If this is helpful to you, you\n       can use it. It is one he has used for many years. If there is some other analysis\n       that you want to use, of course, that’s fine, too. Remember he looks at the\n       facts of the capital murder, the person’s history of violence, his attitude about\n       the use of violence, his personality and behavioral characteristics, his\n       conscience, and the society that he’s going to be in.\n\nThe other prosecutor did not even mention Dr. Coons during his closing argument, but the\n\ndefense discounted Dr. Coons’s methodology and the basis for his opinion: “Dr. Coons, no\n\nliterature or scientific study basis for what he does. I mean, anybody could come in and give\n\nyou that opinion.” The jury did not need any expert’s opinion to determine whether appellant\n\nwould likely commit acts of violence in the future just as he had done in the past. They heard\n\nit from the horse’s mouth. Because the admission of Dr. Coons’s opinion testimony was\n\nharmless error, we overrule appellant’s second point of error.\n\n                  Challenges to the Constitutionality of Article 37.071\n\n       In his third point of error, appellant asserts that Article 37.071, the statute that sets out\n\nthe Texas capital-murder sentencing procedure, is unconstitutional for myriad reasons.\n\nAppellant relies upon eleven different motions, memoranda, or written objections that he had\n\nfiled before and during trial. This point of error, combining eleven different and distinct\n\nclaims, is multifarious, and we could properly dismiss this entire point of error for that\n\f                                                                                 Gobert    Page 18\n\nreason.22 Nevertheless, in the interest of justice, we will address the three legal theories that\n\nappellant briefed on appeal.\n\n       Appellant asserts that Article 37.071 is inadequate and unconstitutional because\n\nprosecutorial discretion is “too broad to guarantee that the death penalty will be fairly and\n\nevenly applied in all 254 counties.” We have repeatedly rejected this claim,23 and appellant\n\noffers no persuasive reasons why those decisions should be overruled.\n\n       Appellant also claims that Article 37.071 is inadequate and unconstitutional because\n\nthe future-dangerousness issue is submitted to the jury, but it is not alleged in the indictment.\n\nWe have repeatedly rejected this claim as well,24 and appellant’s arguments do not persuade\n\nus that those decisions should be overruled.\n\n       Finally, appellant claims that the types of evidence currently used by prosecutors to\n\nprove death-worthiness are unreliable and therefore the statute is unconstitutional. He asserts\n\nthat, because prosecutors offer testimony by such witnesses as Mr. Merillat and Dr. Coons,\n\n“Article 37.071 invites nothing but unfairness in determining who gets the death penalty,\n\nhow that issue is determined, and the type of evidence typically [relied] on to make that\n\n\n\n       22\n        Aldrich v. State, 928 S.W.2d 558, 559 n.1 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Sterling v. State,\n800 S.W.2d 513, 518 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).\n       23\n          See, e.g., Busby v. State, 253 S.W.3d 661, 667 (Tex. Crim.

State, 969\nS.W.2d 4, 13 (1998)).\n\f                                                                                  Gobert    Page 19\n\ndetermination.”25 But the fact that some prosecutors, in some cases, have offered some\n\nevidence that might be improper does not render the statute unconstitutional in all of its\n\napplications.26 And appellant has failed to show that Article 37.071 was unconstitutional as\n\napplied to him as we have already held that (1) the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\n\nadmitting Mr. Merillat’s testimony, and (2) the erroneous admission of Dr. Coons’s opinion\n\ntestimony in this case was harmless.27 Appellant’s third point of error is overruled.\n\n                    The Mid-Trial Continuance to Investigate Tasha Lass\n\n       In point of error four, appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to grant a\n\nlonger mid-trial continuance so the defense could investigate the background and testimony\n\nof its own witness, Deputy Tasha Lass. And, in point of error five, appellant asserts that his\n\ntrial attorneys were ineffective in failing to investigate Deputy Lass before calling her as a\n\nwitness in the defense case-in-chief.\n\n       As noted above, appellant called Deputy Lass in the guilt stage to testify to the lack\n\nof privacy in the Travis County jail cells. Her testimony could explain how appellant’s\n\ncellmate might have learned about the details of the capital murder from a source other than\n\n\n\n\n       25\n            Appellant’s Brief at 28.\n       26\n          See Tex.

State, 205 S.W.3d 534, 536 n.2 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n       27\n           See Gillenwaters, 205 S.W.3d at 537 n.3 (“A claim that a statute is unconstitutional ‘as\napplied’ is a claim that the statute, although generally constitutional, operates unconstitutionally\nas to the claimant because of his particular circumstances.”).\n\f                                                                            Gobert   Page 20\n\nappellant’s confession to him. When the defense requested that Deputy Lass be allowed to\n\nremain in the courtroom after her short testimony was complete, however, the prosecutors’\n\nsuspicion were aroused.     They investigated and later called Deputy Lass during the\n\npunishment phase to testify to her improper relationship with appellant and to the fact that\n\nappellant had manipulated her into sneaking a cell phone into the jail for him. The State\n\ncalled her again when, at the suggestion of her own attorney, she admitted that appellant had\n\ntried to talk her into bringing him a .45 pistol, silencer, and four magazines of ammunition\n\nto help him implement his escape plan.\n\n       After hearing the testimony of the escape plan, appellant’s counsel made an oral\n\nmotion for continuance because Deputy Lass’s testimony was “highly inflammatory” and\n\n“devastating, to say the least. . . . I mean, for all we know she may be psychotic.” Counsel\n\nexplained, “We need to have my investigator check her background, check some of the stuff\n\nshe said, whether or not it’s true, classic impeachment stuff that we’re now being denied\n\nbecause all of a sudden this stuff just came up.”\n\n       The trial judge told the prosecutors to give defense counsel any criminal record they\n\ncould find on Deputy Lass, and he suggested that counsel take her on voir dire to “establish\n\na baseline” for impeachment research. After completing that voir dire, the trial judge\n\npostponed cross-examination until the next day to give the defense time to research possible\n\navenues of impeachment. The next day, defense counsel said that they had not had enough\n\ntime to make a thorough investigation, so the trial judge gave them a daylong continuance\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 21\n\nand ordered jailers to permit defense counsel to view appellant’s cell and the jail layout.\n\n       When the court reconvened, defense counsel made another oral motion for\n\ncontinuance.    At that point, the trial judge overruled the motion, stating that cross-\n\nexamination was likely the best means of discovering information because he would not\n\nallow other witnesses to impeach Deputy Lass on collateral matters.\n\n       First, we hold that appellant failed to preserve error because he did not file a sworn\n\nwritten motion for continuance.28 Although he might be excused from filing a written motion\n\nimmediately after Deputy Lass’s direct examination, he clearly had an opportunity to file a\n\nwritten motion the next day–when the trial judge granted a daylong continuance–or the day\n\nafter that–when the trial judge denied any further continuance. Moreover, appellant did not\n\nfile a motion for new trial on this basis, setting out what specific admissible impeachment\n\nevidence he would have discovered had a longer continuance been granted.29\n\n       Second, appellant has failed to show that the trial judge abused his discretion in\n\ndeclining to grant a lengthier continuance because he has not shown any prejudice.

As the State notes, it was appellant who suggested that his attorneys should call\n\nDeputy Lass.        Nonetheless, Deputy Lass’s testimony concerning her inappropriate\n\nrelationship with appellant, her conduct in smuggling in a cell phone for him, and appellant’s\n\nconfiding his murderous “escape plan” to her is so unexpected that we cannot find that\n\ncounsel’s failure to independently investigate the potential for this type of relationship was\n\ndeficient conduct.\n\n       Counsel has a duty to conduct an independent investigation into the facts of the case\n\nand “should not blindly rely on the veracity either of his client’s version of the facts or\n\n\n\n\n       33\n            Gonzales v.

The only two people who\n\nknew about this evidence were appellant and Deputy Lass; if appellant did not want this\n\nrelationship exposed, he should not have suggested Deputy Lass as a witness.\n\n       Appellant’s counsel had no reason to suspect any secret relationship between appellant\n\nand a law-enforcement officer and thus no reason to investigate that relationship or the\n\nofficer’s background. “Counsel was entitled to formulate a strategy that was reasonable at\n\nthe time and to balance limited resources in accord with effective trial tactics and\n\nstrategies.”39 To hold otherwise, would require counsel to be prepared for “any contingency”\n\nregardless of how improbable or remote it may be and would require counsel to divert scarce\n\nresources to investigate minor law-enforcement witnesses whose veracity and integrity may\n\nnormally be assumed.40\n\n       Furthermore, we should not find that counsel’s failure to investigate Deputy Lass’s\n\nrelationship with appellant before calling her as a minor witness was “so outrageous that no\n\ncompetent attorney would have engaged in it,” without affording counsel the opportunity to\n\n\n\n\n       39\n            See id. at 789.\n       40\n           See id. at 791 (holding that lower court had erred in suggesting that counsel must be\nprepared for “any contingency”); Yarborough v.

He claims that trial counsel undermined his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\n\nright to testify by letting the jury know that counsel thought it was a bad idea.\n\n       At the end of the punishment phase, appellant’s counsel informed the trial judge,\n\noutside the presence of the jury, that appellant insisted on exercising his right to testify. All\n\nthree defense counsel were concerned and registered their opposition, on the record, to\n\nappellant’s decision. When lead counsel began his direct examination of appellant before\n\nthe jury, he acknowledged his disagreement with appellant’s decision to testify and\n\ncharacterized appellant’s decision to plead for his life as one that would subject him to\n\n\n\n\n       41\n          See Goodspeed v. State, 187 S.W.3d 390, 392 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005) (“‘[T]rial\ncounsel should ordinarily be afforded an opportunity to explain his actions before being\ndenounced as ineffective.’ Absent such an opportunity, an appellate court should not find\ndeficient performance unless the challenged conduct was ‘so outrageous that no competent\nattorney would have engaged in it.’”) (citations and footnotes omitted).\n       42\n         Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694 (to establish prejudice, a defendant must show “a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding\nwould have been different.”).\n\f                                                                              Gobert    Page 27\n\n“dehumanization” by the prosecutor.43 This introductory colloquy–that appellant wanted to\n\ntake the witness stand to make a plea for his life even though he knew the prosecutor would\n\nattempt to shred his story and dehumanize his actions–set the stage for the beginning of\n\ncounsel’s impassioned closing argument at punishment: “Milton Dwayne Gobert wanted his\n\nopportunity to come up here and basically ask each one of you, don’t take my life. And I\n\nknow he did something very terrible and it’s going to be hard for you to listen to his plea.\n\nAll I can do is say, please, don’t take his life.” Then, at the end of his argument, counsel\n\ncircled back again to the colloquy at the beginning of appellant’s testimony and plea for his\n\nlife: “I am pleading with you. He pleaded with you. He said, spare my life, spare my life.”\n\n       Appellant cites no case law from any jurisdiction holding that counsel’s introductory\n\nquestions expressing concern about a defendant’s decision to testify and subject himself to\n\ncross-examination are constitutionally deficient. As the State points out, the limited authority\n\n\n\n       43\n         The colloquy was as follows:\nQ:     Mr. Gobert, you asked–you asked to address this jury; is that correct?\nA:     Yes, sir.\nQ:     Let me just go through some ground rules with you, okay, because you and I don’t\n       necessarily agree with this, correct? It that right?\nA:     Yes, sir, we don’t agree.\nQ:     And you know that I have concerns that because you are taking the witness stand they are\n       going to be able to question you about everything and try to make you look bad. You saw\n       what happens on that witness stand to witnesses. You know what happens to them, don’t\n       you?\nA:     Yeah. It is not a concern, though, to me.\nQ:     Okay. But you wanted to address this jury and make a plea for you life, didn’t you?\nA:     Yes, sir.\nQ:     Even though in making that plea for your life, now they are going to put you under\n       intense cross-examination to dehumanize you. Do you know that?\nA:     Well, they did–done a lot of dehumanizing, yes, sir. I’m not concerned with that.\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 28\n\non this issue indicates that counsel’s conduct was both reasonable and non-prejudicial. The\n\nState cites to Noel v. Norris,44 in which the Eighth Circuit upheld the state court’s finding that\n\ncounsel’s statement during direct examination that his client–a capital-murder defendant–was\n\ntestifying against counsel’s advice “was designed to impress the jury with [the defendant’s]\n\nsincerity.”45 The Eighth Circuit held that “[t]he trial strategy that counsel pursued was not\n\nprofessionally unreasonable. Our conclusion finds strong support in the fact that [the\n\ndefendant] could not identify, nor could we find, a single case where counsel, under similar\n\nfacts, was found to be ineffective.” 46\n\n       The record in this case reflects that counsel’s apparent strategy was a reasonable one:\n\nhe was framing appellant’s decision to testify and plead for his life as something he felt so\n\nstrongly about that he was willing to risk the consequences of a merciless cross-examination.\n\nAs the State notes, “Counsel used the opportunity to frame the State’s subsequent cross-\n\n\n\n\n       44\n            322 F.3d 500 (8th Cir. 2003).\n       45\n          Id. at 502. The colloquy in that case, as described by the Arkansas Supreme Court, was\nas follows:\nQ:      All right. Now, Riley, you’re taking the stand here because you want to tell the jury your\n        story. Is that correct?\nA:      Yes, sir.\nQ:      And that’s over my advice?\nA:      Yes, sir.\nQ:      Against my advice?\nA:      Yes, sir.\nNoel v. State, 26 S.W.3d 123, 127 (Ark. 2000).\n       46\n            322 F.3d at 502.\n\f                                                                              Gobert    Page 29\n\nexamination as dehumanizing not only of appellant but also of other witnesses.” 47\n\n       Appellant asserts that the colloquy concerning the advisability of testifying takes place\n\noutside the presence of the jury, but “[i]n this case the colloquy took place in front of the\n\njury, and was of benefit only to trial counsel,” not appellant.48 This is not entirely accurate.\n\nAll three counsel expressed their disagreement with appellant’s decision to testify on the\n\nrecord outside the presence of the jury. Counsel had no need to “benefit himself” by\n\nrepeating that disagreement in front of the jury. The record supports the inference that this\n\nstrategy was designed to benefit his client and emphasize how strongly appellant wanted to\n\nmake a sincere personal plea to the jury for mercy.\n\n       We find that appellant has failed to establish that his counsel provided ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in his strategy of framing appellant’s choice to testify despite counsel’s\n\nconcerns about a “dehumanizing” cross-examination. Because we find that counsel’s\n\nperformance was not constitutionally deficient, we need not address the second, prejudice\n\nprong of Strickland.49 We overrule appellant’s sixth point of error.\n\n                                   The Search Warrant Affidavits\n\n       In his seventh and final point of error, appellant claims that the trial judge erred in\n\nfailing to grant his motion to suppress evidence of his DNA and items taken from his\n\n\n\n       47\n            State’s Brief at 59.\n       48\n            Appellant’s Brief at 33.\n       49\n            466 U.S. at 694.\n\f                                                                                 Gobert    Page 30\n\napartment and car under four separate search warrants. He argues that the first two\n\naffidavits did not establish probable cause to search and the second two affidavits were\n\nbased, in part, on his illegally obtained confession. He claims that, without the inclusion of\n\nthose statements, the magistrate lacked a substantial basis for concluding that there was\n\nprobable cause to search appellant’s apartment or obtain his DNA. We conclude that all four\n\naffidavits contain sufficient, lawfully obtained, information to support a finding of probable\n\ncause to search.\n\n       At a pretrial hearing, the trial judge granted appellant’s motion to suppress his\n\nconfession. The judge found that, at the beginning of the interview, appellant had invoked\n\nhis Fifth Amendment right to counsel, thus the detectives violated his Miranda rights in\n\ncontinuing to question him after that invocation.50 Appellant then filed a motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained from four separate search warrants.\n\n       At the suppression hearing, Officer Fuentes testified that he prepared affidavits on\n\nOctober 7, 2003, to search appellant’s apartment and car. He drafted those affidavits and\n\nsearch warrants–State’s Exhibit 5 & 6–at the time that appellant was being interviewed by\n\nothers, and he did not rely upon any information from that ongoing interview. In his\n\naffidavit, Officer Fuentes relied upon information\n\n       !       from Demetrius that the murderer was “a male, not white, with a shaved head\n               and mustache wearing a striped shirt and silver shorts,” and Demestrius’s\n\n\n       50\n          The State pursued a pretrial appeal of this ruling, but this Court ultimately upheld the\ntrial judge’s ruling excluding the confession. State v. Gobert, 275 S.W.3d 888, 889 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 2009).\n\f                                                                              Gobert    Page 31\n\n              statement that the murderer put his mother’s purse inside a black bag that the\n              man brought with him;\n\n       !      from Christina Pocharansang that she suspected appellant was the murderer\n              and her report that appellant had assaulted her the previous month, so she\n              called Ms. Cotton to help her secretly move out of appellant’s apartment, that\n              Ms. Cotton had several friends help her move out, but in the process “they\n              stole some of Gobert’s property”;\n\n       !      that appellant had open arrest warrants for parole violations and assault;\n\n       !      that when officers went to arrest appellant at his apartment, the manager\n              showed them appellant’s blue Taurus car;\n\n       !      that when officers arrested appellant, they saw what appeared to be blood in\n              several places on the living room carpet;\n\n       !      that, after arresting appellant, one of the officers looked into appellant’s blue\n              Taurus and saw “what appeared to be blood on the steering column and on the\n              driver’s door lock”;\n\n       !      that, after arresting appellant, the officers saw knife cuts on appellant’s hands;\n\n       !      from appellant’s brother’s girlfriend that appellant arrived at their apartment\n              shortly after the murders to take a shower and when he arrived he was carrying\n              a black duffel bag.\n\n       Officer Fuentes went through all of this information and verified that none of it came\n\nfrom appellant. The magistrate found probable cause to search both appellant’s apartment\n\nand car based on this information and officers conducted those searches, under warrant, the\n\nnext day. They seized numerous items of evidentiary value.\n\n       Detective Burgh then compiled a second search warrant for appellant’s apartment on\n\nOctober 15, 2003. This affidavit includes the same information as that in the first two\n\naffidavits, but added some information from appellant’s confession as well. The only\n\f                                                                               Gobert    Page 32\n\nevidence seized under this third warrant was a black and blue bag with toiletries in it. Det.\n\nBurgh also compiled a November 5, 2003, search warrant and affidavit to collect appellant’s\n\nDNA. That affidavit included the same information that was in the October 7th affidavits as\n\nwell as information from appellant’s confession.\n\n       The trial judge overruled the motion to suppress evidence and entered findings that\n\nthe first two search warrant affidavits contained sufficient facts to establish probable cause\n\nand the second two affidavits contained sufficient facts to establish probable cause, even\n\nafter appellant’s illegally obtained statements were excluded.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment expresses a strong preference for searches to be conducted\n\npursuant to a search warrant based on probable cause.51 “Probable cause for a search warrant\n\nexists if, under the totality of the circumstances presented to the magistrate, there is at least\n\na ‘fair probability’ or ‘substantial chance’ that contraband or evidence of a crime will be\n\nfound at the specified location.”52 Our duty, and that of the trial judge, in reviewing the\n\nmagistrate’s finding of probable cause “is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a\n\nsubstantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed.” 53 As appellant aptly noted,\n\nreviewing courts do not act as a “rubber stamp,” but “the magistrate’s decision should carry\n\n\n\n\n       51\n         Illinois v.

We disagree. The magistrate had before him not\n\nonly Christina’s suspicion, but also her cogent reasons for that suspicion, as well as the\n\nevidence of bloodstains on appellant’s carpet, bloodstains on his car steering column and\n\ndriver’s door lock, evidence of cuts–apparently superficial knife wounds–on appellant’s\n\nhands, evidence that appellant had arrived at his brother’s apartment shortly after the murders\n\nto take a quick shower and then leave, and Demetrius’s description of the murderer–a\n\ndescription consistent with appellant’s appearance.\n\n       Based on the totality of the information contained in the first two affidavits and giving\n\n“great deference” to the magistrate’s finding, we agree that the magistrate had a “substantial\n\nbasis” for concluding that the affidavits established probable cause to search appellant’s car\n\nand apartment.55 Thus, the trial judge did not err in denying appellant’s motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained as a result of the first two search warrants.\n\n       As for the second two search warrants, State’s Exhibits 7 & 8, the affiant repeated,\n\n\n\n       54\n        Appellant’s Brief at 36 (quoting WAYNE LA FAVE , SEARCH AND SEIZURE: A TREATISE\n                                             th\nON THE FOURTH AMENDMENT § 11.7(c) at 452 (4 ed. 2004 & Supp. 2009-2010)).\n\n       55\n            State v.

Finding no reversible error,\n\nwe affirm the judgment and sentence.\n\f                                                                           Gobert   Page 2\n\n                                  Factual Background\n\n       In the early hours of October 6, 2003, five-year-old Demetrius Cotton was awakened\n\nby the sound of his mother, Mel Cotton, screaming from her bedroom. He went into her\n\nroom and saw a strange man there–“kind of tall, bald, and buff.” He had a mustache and was\n\nwearing boots and boxers. He had gloves on his hands. Demetrius saw his mom sitting on\n\nthe edge of the bed with duct tape on her mouth; the man was standing in front of her,\n\nstabbing her in the arms with a sharp knife. She was trying to get away from him. She stood\n\nup, but then lost her balance and fell. The man kept stabbing, so Demetrius “ran over and\n\ntried to pull him down by his leg.” He said, “Stop,” but the man pushed him off, turned on\n\nthe bedside light and continued stabbing at his mom. The man told Demetrius, “sit down and\n\nshut up,” so Demetrius sat down. He was scared.\n\n       Then the man put duct tape on Demetrius’s ankles and mouth. He told Demetrius to\n\nget out of the room, so the child hopped out into the hallway. The man locked the door\n\nwhen Demetrius tried to get back inside the bedroom. He heard his mom scream, “Leave me\n\nalone,” but the man said, “Give me the money” and “Where is it at in your purse?”\n\nDemetrius hopped into his room and sat on a pallet of blankets beside his bed. He heard the\n\nman take his mom’s phone and “stomp on it” in the bathroom. The man also cut the\n\ntelephone cord.\n\n       Demetrius fell asleep, but he woke up when he heard the man come into his room.\n\nThe man “choked” Demetrius with both hands. Demetrius tried to scream, but he couldn’t.\n\f                                                                              Gobert    Page 3\n\nHe blacked out. When he woke up later, he had a hole in his chest with blood coming out.\n\nHe went to his mom’s room. She was laying on the floor on her side. Demetrius felt her\n\nneck. It was cold. “[S]he was gone.” He touched her hand and talked to her for a while.\n\nThen he went to the bathroom for a washcloth to stop his chest from bleeding. He looked\n\nto see if anyone else was there in the apartment. The man was gone. Demetrius ate a\n\npopsicle, then went back to his room, got his stuffed caterpillar, and waited for a long time\n\nfor someone to come. He fell asleep again, but woke up early that Monday morning when\n\nhe heard knocking on the door. He took his stool to the door to see out of the peephole, and\n\nwhen he saw his “Aunt Tweety,” he opened the door.\n\n       Monica Salinas, who lived in the same Austin apartment complex as Mel Cotton and\n\nDemetrius, heard a hysterical woman crying, “My sister is dead, my sister is dead, please help\n\nme.” She ran up the stairs, saw Demetrius with duct tape still around his neck and Mel\n\nCotton’s body in the master bedroom, so she called 911. She saw “blood everywhere and\n\nhandprints of blood all over the room.”\n\n       Paramedics rushed Demetrius to the hospital. He had four stab wounds in his chest.\n\nThey were so deep that a paramedic saw Demetrius’s lung inflating and deflating. Demetrius\n\nsaid that he could hear the air coming out of the hole in his chest; it sounded like “a farting\n\nnoise.” Demetrius lost twenty to thirty percent of his blood volume and had a pneumothorax\n\n(collapsed lung) and a pulmonary contusion. Doctors also determined that Demetrius had\n\nbeen strangled. Although his wounds were life-threatening, Demetrius recovered.\n\f                                                                                  Gobert     Page 4\n\n       The medical examiner testified that Mel Cotton had a total of 107 stab wounds that\n\nwere inflicted during a drawn-out attack. Thirty-eight of the wounds were centered around\n\nMs. Cotton’s left breast, indicating “some degree of [the victim’s] incapacitation or lack of\n\nmovement.” Another group of wounds were in her back. She had approximately thirteen\n\ndefensive wounds to her hands and arms. Twenty of the wounds reached her internal organs.\n\nShe, like Demetrius, had been strangled. The medical examiner said that Ms. Cotton had\n\nprobably been conscious for about ten to twenty minutes after her jugular vein had been cut.\n\n       Christina Pocharasang, appellant’s former girlfriend, learned of Ms. Cotton’s murder\n\nlater that day. She immediately suspected appellant. She testified that Ms. Cotton had\n\nhelped her move out of appellant’s apartment two weeks earlier by arranging for a man\n\nnamed Kenneth to haul her heavy furniture. Appellant had been furious and accused Ms.\n\nCotton and Kenneth of stealing his things, including his vacuum cleaner.1 Christina called\n\nappellant to ask him about the murder. When he answered the phone, appellant was\n\nbreathing heavily and said that he had been in a fight with Kenneth, who had stabbed him in\n\nthe stomach, causing an injury that required sixteen stitches. Christina then called the Austin\n\npolice to report her suspicions.\n\n       Austin police discovered that appellant had an outstanding parole-violation warrant\n\n\n       1\n         Appellant left numerous threatening voicemails for Christina, saying such things as\n“Yeah, ho, you go on and do what you like. I don’t give a f__ no more . But I bet you this one\nthing. You still got my shit, you keep that. That’s yours. Since you distributed my shit to all this\ndifferent mother f____ and shit. And gave my shit to these niggers. You gave my shit to these\nniggers. But bitch, one day you’re going to look up, and you’re going to see me. Bet that.”\n\f                                                                                  Gobert    Page 5\n\nand went to his apartment to arrest him. After peeking through his blinds, appellant refused\n\nto open the door, so the officers made a forced entry. Appellant did not have a stab wound\n\nin his stomach, but he did have cuts on his right hand that looked like those made when an\n\nattacker loses his grip on a knife shaft and cuts his own hand.\n\n       Officers obtained a search warrant for appellant’s apartment and car. They found\n\nstain remover, bleach, and vinegar containers; a glove on top of the washing machine; and\n\na glove, tennis shoes, and a striped shirt inside the washing machine. DNA consistent with\n\nthat of Ms. Cotton’s DNA was found on the left tennis shoe, and DNA consistent with that\n\nof appellant, Ms. Cotton, and an unknown male2 was found on the glove on top of the\n\nwashing machine. A latent fingerprint, matching appellant’s fingerprint, was found on Ms.\n\nCotton’s bedroom window blind.\n\n       While in jail, appellant bragged to his cellmate about stabbing Ms. Cotton and\n\nDemetrius. He recounted details of the crime, including wrapping Ms. Cotton in an\n\nextension cord, washing his bloody clothes, and throwing the knife that he used in a lake.3\n\n       Appellant called a jail guard, Deputy Tasha Lass, to testify that the inmates did not\n\nhave much privacy in their jail cells, thus suggesting that perhaps the cellmate could have\n\nlearned details about the murder from reading appellant’s case files in his jail cell.\n\n       Appellant also made numerous phone calls from the jail to family members,\n\n\n       2\n            When the DNA analysis was made, the technician did not have Demetrius’s DNA.\n       3\n            During his punishment-stage testimony, appellant confirmed that he threw the knife into\nthe lake.\n\f                                                                                      Gobert     Page 6\n\nsuggesting to one brother that he might remember that appellant and Mel Cotton had a sexual\n\nrelationship. Appellant’s older brother told appellant to stop asking him, his brother, and\n\ntheir mother to lie for him. These calls were recorded and played at trial.4 In them, appellant\n\ntold various versions of the events.\n\n        One of appellant’s brothers testified at trial to the version of events that appellant told\n\nhim. According to appellant, he and Mel Cotton had had sex that night, and then he went to\n\nsleep in her bed. She later woke him up, and they began arguing. She came at him with a\n\nknife, saying that she was going to shoot him with a gun. They struggled over the knife. He\n\ngot the knife, but when he tried to get dressed and leave, she attacked him again. Demetrius\n\ncame into the room and “fell” on the knife that his mother was holding. Appellant told his\n\nbrother that he had stayed with the little boy, giving him pain pills, until Demetrius’s aunt\n\narrived the next morning. Appellant told his family members that “wasn’t nothing wrong\n\nwith [Demetrius], he was–he’s alive and he wasn’t seriously hurt. . . . He wasn’t hurt bad at\n\nall. He went to school the next day.”\n\n        The jury found appellant guilty of capital murder.\n\n        During the punishment phase, the State introduced appellant’s prior convictions for\n\n\n\n        4\n           In one of them, appellant told his brother that a jury would surely sentence him to death\nif they heard that he had attacked and stabbed his mother when he was nineteen, so he wanted his\nmother to lie about that event. “I can’t have her up there. That’s, that’s suicide. . . . What am I\ngoing to look like in these folks’ eyes? . . . I mean it’s not about telling the truth, get up there and\ntell the truth, that’s suicide, man. . . . How can you say if you love somebody that you’re gonna\nsit up there and, and, and get up there and, and help go to the death chamber? That’s suicide for\nme, man.”\n\f                                                                              Gobert   Page 7\n\nburglary of a habitation, robbery, false imprisonment, assault, and dating-violence assault.\n\n       Christina Pocharasang testified again and recounted three different violent episodes.\n\nOne time, several months before the murder, appellant punched her in her face because she\n\ndid not want to cut her hair the way appellant wanted it cut. He chased her into the bathroom\n\nand kept hitting her for about thirty minutes. Then, about two weeks before the murder,\n\nappellant got angry when Christina asked him to go to his brother’s church. He closed the\n\nbedroom door so Christina’s son couldn’t see him, and he choked Christina with both hands\n\naround her neck. Christina decided to move out of town, and she contacted her friend, Mel\n\nCotton, who found Kenneth to help her move. But, in late September, Christina forgave\n\nappellant and came back to Austin. One night, appellant attacked her as she was driving. He\n\npunched her in the face five or six times, choked her neck, bit her on the shoulder,5 hit her\n\nin her lower back about fifteen times, and crushed her cell phone so she couldn’t call for\n\nhelp. He told Christina he was going to kill her. Christina finally escaped, drove to a\n\nhospital, and called the police. Nine days later, appellant killed Mel Cotton.\n\n       Another woman testified that she had dated appellant in 2002, but he got jealous and\n\nbegan hitting her and grabbing her by the neck when he was angry. She told him that she\n\nwanted nothing more to do with him. But one day he came over, and she got into his car to\n\ntalk to him. Appellant became angry again and, after she jumped out of his moving car, he\n\ncame after her and started hitting her in the face. Her father called the police and she filed\n\n\n\n       5\n           Six years later, Christina still had a scar from that bite.\n\f                                                                                  Gobert    Page 8\n\nassault charges against him.\n\n       A third woman testified that she had dated appellant when they were both in high\n\nschool. He was often verbally abusive to her, but one day he got jealous and hit her in the\n\nnose, then threatened to kill her as he forcibly took her back to his apartment. The next\n\nmorning she escaped by grabbing her car keys. She drove off, speeding and running red\n\nlights when she saw appellant driving behind her. She stopped, got out of her car and started\n\ncalling for help, but no one paid attention to her, so she raced back to her car. Appellant was\n\non the roof of her car. She nevertheless drove to a friend’s house, got out, and appellant\n\ndrove off in her car. Several years later, appellant found her in Round Rock, burglarized her\n\nfriend’s home, stole a TV and purse, and kidnapped her. The police eventually found her\n\nat appellant’s apartment, and he went to prison for burglary. She related another incident in\n\nwhich appellant choked her when he found out she was dating someone else. Even though\n\nappellant has been locked up in jail for years, she is still afraid that he will come back for her.\n\n       A former cellmate testified that appellant assaulted him while he was lying in his\n\nbunk. Appellant said that he was a Muslim and didn’t want to be in a cell with a Catholic.\n\nAppellant accused the cellmate of farting while appellant was praying, and then he began\n\nhitting the man in the chest, saying that he would kill him. The cellmate, in fear of his life,\n\nasked to be moved. Appellant had numerous instances of disruptive conduct while in jail\n\nand, at one point, was assessed fifteen days of administrative segregation for his actions.\n\n       A former female jailer who had given appellant special privileges resigned when her\n\f                                                                               Gobert    Page 9\n\nsuperiors discovered that she had been “fraternizing” with appellant. Thereafter, she visited\n\nappellant in jail seventeen times in six months.\n\n         Tasha Lass, the female jailer whom appellant had called to testify during the guilt\n\nstage, was called by the prosecution during the punishment stage. She admitted that she, too,\n\nhad been fraternizing with appellant for several weeks. She said that she had brought\n\nappellant a cell phone so he could call her from the jail without their conversations being\n\nrecorded. They talked on the phone every day, and appellant repeatedly told Deputy Lass\n\nthat he loved her. She testified that he was still talking to her every day on the smuggled cell\n\nphone.\n\n         Another jailer testified that, after Deputy Lass’s testimony, he had searched\n\nappellant’s jail cell and found the cell phone stuffed into a bag of Cheetos inside appellant’s\n\ncommissary bag. A cell phone charger was also found. Deputy Lass was then arrested and\n\ncharged with the felony of bringing a prohibited item into a correctional facility.\n\n         Yet another officer testified that a piece of plastic had been wedged into appellant’s\n\nleg brace that he was required to wear as he was transported each day from the jail to the\n\ncourtroom so that it would not lock. A different officer testified that appellant had tampered\n\nwith his leg brace on a second occasion as well. That time appellant was walking around in\n\nthe open courtroom with his leg brace unlocked.\n\n         After the defense offered several mitigation witnesses and rested, the State then\n\nrecalled Tasha Lass to testify about “an escape plan.” This time, Deputy Lass testified that\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 10\n\nshe had originally been a missionary in Romania, and then had traveled to Sri Lanka,\n\nAustralia, and England for eight years. She then became a police officer in Chattanooga,\n\nTennessee, and was named Patrol Officer of the Year in 2008. She moved to Austin, became\n\na deputy in June 2009, and first met appellant around Christmastime. She listened to him talk\n\nabout his case, his family, and his problems in jail. He made her feel “needed.” He told her\n\nabout his escape plan and wanted her to buy a storage shed so he could hide out “with food\n\nand stuff” until he escaped to Dubai. He chose Dubai because it is a Muslim country and he\n\ncould not be extradited from there. He also wanted her a buy a .45 pistol with a silencer and\n\nfour magazines and bring it into the jail “so he could shoot people and locks to get out.”\n\n       Appellant told Deputy Lass that he planned to call Deputy Fernandes over to his cell\n\nat 2:30 a.m., shoot him, drag the deputy’s body into the cell, change into his clothes, grab his\n\ncar keys,6 shoot any other inmates who saw him, kill the control-room operator,7 take the\n\nkeys to the fire closet, grab the bag inside that closet that contained a rope, then go to the top\n\nfloor fire closet for another rope, go out the roof door, tie the two ropes together and attach\n\none end to the building, toss the rope over the edge and climb down, run over to the parking\n\ngarage and drive off in Deputy Fernandes’s car. Appellant would “knock out” Deputy Lass\n\nand put her in the fire closet, but she did not believe that he would leave her alive. She said\n\nthat she did not want to aid in this escape plan, but appellant kept asking her every day.\n\n\n       6\n         Appellant told Ms. Lass that he had seen Deputy Fernandes drive in and out of the\nparking garage, so he knew which car was his and where it was parked.\n       7\n           Appellant wanted Ms. Lass to be in the control room so she could give him the keys.\n\f                                                                             Gobert    Page 11\n\n       The State also called Dr. Richard Coons who testified that, in his opinion, a\n\nhypothetical person with appellant’s history, conduct, and character would likely pose a\n\ndanger of violence in the future.\n\n       Finally, the defense called appellant to the witness stand. He admitted that he had hurt\n\na lot of women. He said that he had hit his brother over the head with a statue and beaten his\n\nmother and the women that he loved. It was because of “anger issues and situations. . . .\n\nMaybe sometimes I go overboard.”\n\n       Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, the trial judge sentenced appellant\n\nto death. After hearing a victim allocution statement by Mel Cotton’s sister, appellant\n\nshouted, “That bitch wasn’t no angel. That was a bitch, a motherf___ bitch. F___ all y’all.\n\nThat was a bitch a ho bitch.” When the trial judge attempted to interrupt, appellant said, “No,\n\nf__ you. F____ your allocution. F___ all you motherf____.”\n\n       Thus ended the trial of Milton Dwayne Gobert.\n\n                    The Admission of Evidence at the Punishment Phase\n\n       In two points of error, appellant complains of the admission of expert testimony\n\noffered at the punishment phase. In point of error one, appellant asserts that the trial court\n\nerred under Daubert,8 Kelly,9 Coble,10 and the Eighth Amendment in admitting testimony by\n\n\n\n       8\n           Daubert v.

We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion\n\nin overruling appellant’s Rule 702 objections.\n\n       Appellant also argues that the trial court’s admission of Mr. Merillat’s testimony\n\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to individualized sentencing because what other\n\nprisoners did or did not do in prison was not relevant to appellant. It was in response to that\n\nargument that the trial judge barred the prosecutor from asking Mr. Merillat any questions\n\nconcerning other inmates or their specific instances of conduct. But the judge concluded that\n\ngeneralized testimony concerning prison conditions, opportunities for violence, weapons\n\nused, and raw data concerning the number of violent acts in TDCJ did not violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment focus on individualized sentencing. Appellant asserts that Mr. Merillat’s\n\ntestimony “is that TDCJ is so grossly incompetent and so dangerous that the safety of all who\n\nenter there is in jeopardy.”14 We do not read Mr. Merillat’s testimony as implying that prison\n\n“is a relentless death trap” that imperils “the safety of all who enter there.” His point was\n\nthat TDCJ, like other prisons, cannot protect against all inmate violence.\n\n       We have previously upheld the admission of Mr. Merillat’s background testimony\n\n\n\n\nthere was a reasonable probability that the jury relied upon that testimony in reaching its verdict).\n       14\n            Appellant’s Brief at 12. Appellant goes on to assert that Mr. Merillat’s “relentless\nmessage is that TDCJ is a death trap, and the only way to make sure that Appellant does not add\nto it is to kill him, since TDCJ is totally ineffectual in safeguarding any of the many, many\npotential victims who work and enter there.” This may be one way of characterizing Mr.\nMerillat’s testimony, but it is certainly not a necessary one.\n\f                                                                                 Gobert     Page 14\n\nover an Eighth Amendment claim in an unpublished opinion.15 While the probative value\n\nof Mr. Merillat’s testimony pales in comparison to that concerning appellant’s specific acts\n\nof violence while incarcerated, its admission did not violate appellant’s Eighth Amendment\n\nright to an individualized sentencing procedure.           The jurors could make an Eighth\n\nAmendment “individualized” assessment of appellant’s likelihood to commit future acts of\n\nviolence based upon his specific actions–some of which he testified to himself–while\n\nincarcerated.16\n\n       We overrule appellant’s first point of error.\n\n       In his second point of error, appellant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting the\n\nopinion of Dr. Coons on the issue of future dangerousness. After a voir dire examination\n\noutside the presence of the jury appellant argued, inter alia, that Dr. Coons\n\n       does not have and has not propounded a sufficiently valid scientific technique\n       or theory that has been accepted as valid by the scientific community.\n\n\n       15\n          Espada v.

He, like Mr. Merillat, talked\nabout the opportunities for violence in prison: “So violence is a part of life in prison, not saying\nthat you go inflict violence, because people that’s not part of a gang, like me, you don’t go\nlooking for trouble.” Appellant testified at length about prison gangs and noted that security had\nbeen “beefed up” since the Texas Seven escape. He knowledgeably discussed “crash gates,”\nsecurity guards, and the prison classification system. He talked about how he had gashed open\nthe back of another inmate with a hoe when he was in minimum custody. He said that he had\nhad five or six fights while in prison, and he “finished them all” but “ain’t nobody lost they life”\nin those fights. He stated that he told a female prison guard that he “would kick her bitch ass,”\nand he threatened to hit a prison guard with his hoe. Appellant also said that he had been in four\nor five fights while awaiting trial in the Travis County jail.\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 15\n\n               Psychiatry is not the study of prediction of future danger; it is, as he has\n       acknowledged, the study of mental disease and mental disorders. Future\n       dangerousness is not one of these. Basically his qualifications do not relate to\n       making such predictions.\n               He has failed to identify any scientific literature or documentation that\n       supports this technique, whatever technique he plans to use. . . .\n               Basically his testimony does not rely upon principles that are involved\n       in the field of psychiatry.\n\n       Appellant also filed a motion and brief outlining his reasons for excluding Dr. Coons’s\n\nopinion testimony under Rules 702-703, as well as the federal and Texas Constitutions. We\n\nconclude that the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting Dr. Coons’s opinion on future\n\ndangerousness17 in this case for the same reasons that we held it inadmissible in Coble v.\n\nState.18 Here, as in that case, Dr. Coons provided no scientific, psychiatric, or psychological\n\nresearch or studies to support his idiosyncratic methodology for predicting whether a\n\nhypothetical person would commit future acts of violence.19\n\n       However, we conclude that the admission of Dr. Coons’s testimony was harmless\n\nerror.20 Given the overwhelming evidence of appellant’s life-long penchant for violence,\n\nthe circumstances of the capital murder, the evidence of his conspiracy to commit capital\n\n\n\n       17\n          Some of Dr. Coons’s testimony, such as that relating to “conduct disorder” as “the\njuvenile version of antisocial personality disorder,” a mental disorder described in the DSM-IV\nthat can cause a person to become violent, was relevant, sufficiently reliable, and admissible.\nOnly his “future dangerousness” opinion based on the lengthy hypothetical posed by the State\nwas insufficiently supported by a reliable methodology.\n       18\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2274174\"><a href=\"/opinion/2274174/coble-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.

The evidence in this case showed that, during prior\n\nperiods of incarceration, appellant had\n\n       !         attacked a fellow prison inmate with a hoe, gashing him in the back;\n\n       !         threatened to hit a prison guard with a hoe;\n\n       !         threatened to fight other prison guards;\n\n       !         gotten into “five or six” fights with fellow prison inmates;\n\n       !         gotten into “four or five” fights with fellow jail inmates;\n\n       !         developed inappropriate relationships with at least two female jail guards and\n                 manipulated them into providing him with contraband or special privileges;\n\n       !         plotted to murder a jailer and steal his car keys and car to effectuate appellant’s\n                 escape;\n\n       !         plotted to kill any other inmates or jailers who might witness that planned\n                 escape; and\n\n       !         manipulated his leg brace so that it could not lock and impede his mobility in\n                 the courtroom during his capital-murder trial.\n\n       Dr. Coons’s opinion concerning a hypothetical person in appellant’s position was, at\n\nmost, superfluous to the specific testimonial evidence of appellant’s proven dangerousness\n\n\n\n       21\n            See Coble, 330 S.W.3d at 280.\n\f                                                                                 Gobert    Page 17\n\nboth in prison and in free society.\n\n       Furthermore, the State did not emphasize or rely upon Dr. Coons’s opinion in closing\n\nargument. One prosecutor briefly mentioned Dr. Coons and his methodology:\n\n               Now, remember the analysis that Dr. Coons uses when he is deciding\n       whether someone is going to be a future danger. If this is helpful to you, you\n       can use it. It is one he has used for many years. If there is some other analysis\n       that you want to use, of course, that’s fine, too. Remember he looks at the\n       facts of the capital murder, the person’s history of violence, his attitude about\n       the use of violence, his personality and behavioral characteristics, his\n       conscience, and the society that he’s going to be in.\n\nThe other prosecutor did not even mention Dr. Coons during his closing argument, but the\n\ndefense discounted Dr. Coons’s methodology and the basis for his opinion: “Dr. Coons, no\n\nliterature or scientific study basis for what he does. I mean, anybody could come in and give\n\nyou that opinion.” The jury did not need any expert’s opinion to determine whether appellant\n\nwould likely commit acts of violence in the future just as he had done in the past. They heard\n\nit from the horse’s mouth. Because the admission of Dr. Coons’s opinion testimony was\n\nharmless error, we overrule appellant’s second point of error.\n\n                  Challenges to the Constitutionality of Article 37.071\n\n       In his third point of error, appellant asserts that Article 37.071, the statute that sets out\n\nthe Texas capital-murder sentencing procedure, is unconstitutional for myriad reasons.\n\nAppellant relies upon eleven different motions, memoranda, or written objections that he had\n\nfiled before and during trial. This point of error, combining eleven different and distinct\n\nclaims, is multifarious, and we could properly dismiss this entire point of error for that\n\f                                                                                 Gobert    Page 18\n\nreason.22 Nevertheless, in the interest of justice, we will address the three legal theories that\n\nappellant briefed on appeal.\n\n       Appellant asserts that Article 37.071 is inadequate and unconstitutional because\n\nprosecutorial discretion is “too broad to guarantee that the death penalty will be fairly and\n\nevenly applied in all 254 counties.” We have repeatedly rejected this claim,23 and appellant\n\noffers no persuasive reasons why those decisions should be overruled.\n\n       Appellant also claims that Article 37.071 is inadequate and unconstitutional because\n\nthe future-dangerousness issue is submitted to the jury, but it is not alleged in the indictment.\n\nWe have repeatedly rejected this claim as well,24 and appellant’s arguments do not persuade\n\nus that those decisions should be overruled.\n\n       Finally, appellant claims that the types of evidence currently used by prosecutors to\n\nprove death-worthiness are unreliable and therefore the statute is unconstitutional. He asserts\n\nthat, because prosecutors offer testimony by such witnesses as Mr. Merillat and Dr. Coons,\n\n“Article 37.071 invites nothing but unfairness in determining who gets the death penalty,\n\nhow that issue is determined, and the type of evidence typically [relied] on to make that\n\n\n\n       22\n        Aldrich v.

And, in point of error five, appellant asserts that his\n\ntrial attorneys were ineffective in failing to investigate Deputy Lass before calling her as a\n\nwitness in the defense case-in-chief.\n\n       As noted above, appellant called Deputy Lass in the guilt stage to testify to the lack\n\nof privacy in the Travis County jail cells.

When the defense requested that Deputy Lass be allowed to\n\nremain in the courtroom after her short testimony was complete, however, the prosecutors’\n\nsuspicion were aroused.     They investigated and later called Deputy Lass during the\n\npunishment phase to testify to her improper relationship with appellant and to the fact that\n\nappellant had manipulated her into sneaking a cell phone into the jail for him. The State\n\ncalled her again when, at the suggestion of her own attorney, she admitted that appellant had\n\ntried to talk her into bringing him a .45 pistol, silencer, and four magazines of ammunition\n\nto help him implement his escape plan.\n\n       After hearing the testimony of the escape plan, appellant’s counsel made an oral\n\nmotion for continuance because Deputy Lass’s testimony was “highly inflammatory” and\n\n“devastating, to say the least. . . . I mean, for all we know she may be psychotic.” Counsel\n\nexplained, “We need to have my investigator check her background, check some of the stuff\n\nshe said, whether or not it’s true, classic impeachment stuff that we’re now being denied\n\nbecause all of a sudden this stuff just came up.”\n\n       The trial judge told the prosecutors to give defense counsel any criminal record they\n\ncould find on Deputy Lass, and he suggested that counsel take her on voir dire to “establish\n\na baseline” for impeachment research. After completing that voir dire, the trial judge\n\npostponed cross-examination until the next day to give the defense time to research possible\n\navenues of impeachment. The next day, defense counsel said that they had not had enough\n\ntime to make a thorough investigation, so the trial judge gave them a daylong continuance\n\f                                                                                Gobert    Page 21\n\nand ordered jailers to permit defense counsel to view appellant’s cell and the jail layout.\n\n       When the court reconvened, defense counsel made another oral motion for\n\ncontinuance.    At that point, the trial judge overruled the motion, stating that cross-\n\nexamination was likely the best means of discovering information because he would not\n\nallow other witnesses to impeach Deputy Lass on collateral matters.\n\n       First, we hold that appellant failed to preserve error because he did not file a sworn\n\nwritten motion for continuance.28 Although he might be excused from filing a written motion\n\nimmediately after Deputy Lass’s direct examination, he clearly had an opportunity to file a\n\nwritten motion the next day–when the trial judge granted a daylong continuance–or the day\n\nafter that–when the trial judge denied any further continuance. Moreover, appellant did not\n\nfile a motion for new trial on this basis, setting out what specific admissible impeachment\n\nevidence he would have discovered had a longer continuance been granted.29\n\n       Second, appellant has failed to show that the trial judge abused his discretion in\n\ndeclining to grant a lengthier continuance because he has not shown any prejudice.

Appellant has not satisfied any of those three prongs.

As the State notes, it was appellant who suggested that his attorneys should call\n\nDeputy Lass.        Nonetheless, Deputy Lass’s testimony concerning her inappropriate\n\nrelationship with appellant, her conduct in smuggling in a cell phone for him, and appellant’s\n\nconfiding his murderous “escape plan” to her is so unexpected that we cannot find that\n\ncounsel’s failure to independently investigate the potential for this type of relationship was\n\ndeficient conduct.\n\n       Counsel has a duty to conduct an independent investigation into the facts of the case\n\nand “should not blindly rely on the veracity either of his client’s version of the facts or\n\n\n\n\n       33\n            Gonzales v.

And I\n\nknow he did something very terrible and it’s going to be hard for you to listen to his plea.\n\nAll I can do is say, please, don’t take his life.” Then, at the end of his argument, counsel\n\ncircled back again to the colloquy at the beginning of appellant’s testimony and plea for his\n\nlife: “I am pleading with you. He pleaded with you. He said, spare my life, spare my life.”\n\n       Appellant cites no case law from any jurisdiction holding that counsel’s introductory\n\nquestions expressing concern about a defendant’s decision to testify and subject himself to\n\ncross-examination are constitutionally deficient. As the State points out, the limited authority\n\n\n\n       43\n         The colloquy was as follows:\nQ:     Mr. Gobert, you asked–you asked to address this jury; is that correct?\nA:     Yes, sir.\nQ:     Let me just go through some ground rules with you, okay, because you and I don’t\n       necessarily agree with this, correct? It that right?\nA:     Yes, sir, we don’t agree.\nQ:     And you know that I have concerns that because you are taking the witness stand they are\n       going to be able to question you about everything and try to make you look bad.

The\n\nState cites to Noel v.

Our conclusion finds strong support in the fact that [the\n\ndefendant] could not identify, nor could we find, a single case where counsel, under similar\n\nfacts, was found to be ineffective.” 46\n\n       The record in this case reflects that counsel’s apparent strategy was a reasonable one:\n\nhe was framing appellant’s decision to testify and plead for his life as something he felt so\n\nstrongly about that he was willing to risk the consequences of a merciless cross-examination.\n\nAs the State notes, “Counsel used the opportunity to frame the State’s subsequent cross-\n\n\n\n\n       44\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781193\"><a href=\"/opinion/781193/riley-dobi-noel-v-larry-norris-director-arkansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 2003).\n       45\n          Id. at 502.

Counsel had no need to “benefit himself” by\n\nrepeating that disagreement in front of the jury. The record supports the inference that this\n\nstrategy was designed to benefit his client and emphasize how strongly appellant wanted to\n\nmake a sincere personal plea to the jury for mercy.\n\n       We find that appellant has failed to establish that his counsel provided ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in his strategy of framing appellant’s choice to testify despite counsel’s\n\nconcerns about a “dehumanizing” cross-examination.

He argues that the first two\n\naffidavits did not establish probable cause to search and the second two affidavits were\n\nbased, in part, on his illegally obtained confession. He claims that, without the inclusion of\n\nthose statements, the magistrate lacked a substantial basis for concluding that there was\n\nprobable cause to search appellant’s apartment or obtain his DNA. We conclude that all four\n\naffidavits contain sufficient, lawfully obtained, information to support a finding of probable\n\ncause to search.\n\n       At a pretrial hearing, the trial judge granted appellant’s motion to suppress his\n\nconfession. The judge found that, at the beginning of the interview, appellant had invoked\n\nhis Fifth Amendment right to counsel, thus the detectives violated his Miranda rights in\n\ncontinuing to question him after that invocation.50 Appellant then filed a motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained from four separate search warrants.\n\n       At the suppression hearing, Officer Fuentes testified that he prepared affidavits on\n\nOctober 7, 2003, to search appellant’s apartment and car. He drafted those affidavits and\n\nsearch warrants–State’s Exhibit 5 & 6–at the time that appellant was being interviewed by\n\nothers, and he did not rely upon any information from that ongoing interview. In his\n\naffidavit, Officer Fuentes relied upon information\n\n       !       from Demetrius that the murderer was “a male, not white, with a shaved head\n               and mustache wearing a striped shirt and silver shorts,” and Demestrius’s\n\n\n       50\n          The State pursued a pretrial appeal of this ruling, but this Court ultimately upheld the\ntrial judge’s ruling excluding the confession.

The magistrate had before him not\n\nonly Christina’s suspicion, but also her cogent reasons for that suspicion, as well as the\n\nevidence of bloodstains on appellant’s carpet, bloodstains on his car steering column and\n\ndriver’s door lock, evidence of cuts–apparently superficial knife wounds–on appellant’s\n\nhands, evidence that appellant had arrived at his brother’s apartment shortly after the murders\n\nto take a quick shower and then leave, and Demetrius’s description of the murderer–a\n\ndescription consistent with appellant’s appearance.\n\n       Based on the totality of the information contained in the first two affidavits and giving\n\n“great deference” to the magistrate’s finding, we agree that the magistrate had a “substantial\n\nbasis” for concluding that the affidavits established probable cause to search appellant’s car\n\nand apartment.55 Thus, the trial judge did not err in denying appellant’s motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained as a result of the first two search warrants.\n\n       As for the second two search warrants, State’s Exhibits 7 & 8, the affiant repeated,\n\n\n\n       54\n        Appellant’s Brief at 36 (quoting WAYNE LA FAVE , SEARCH AND SEIZURE: A TREATISE\n                                             th\nON THE FOURTH AMENDMENT § 11.7(c) at 452 (4 ed. 2004 & Supp. 2009-2010)).\n\n       55\n            State v.
