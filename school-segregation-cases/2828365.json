Therefore, to\noffered from which a trier of fact could conclude that Greene        defeat Warden Brigano’s summary judgment motion, Greene\nwas vulnerable, not just to sexual assault, but also to physical     need only point to evidence from which a finder of fact could\nassaults from her fellow inmates, such that her presence in the      conclude that her vulnerability made her placement in the\nPCU with other inmates without segregation or protective             PCU with high-security inmates a substantial risk to her\nmeasures presented a substantial risk to her safety of which         safety, of which Warden Brigano was aware, or alternately,\nWarden Brigano was aware; and second, Greene has                     evidence from which that finder of fact could conclude that\npresented evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude         Frezzell’s placement in the PCU without segregation or other\nthat Warden Brigano was in fact aware of the substantial risk        protective measures presented a substantial risk to other\nFrezzell posed to any inmate with whom he was placed in the          inmates in the PCU, of which Warden Brigano was aware.\nPCU.                                                                 We conclude that she has done so.\n   In order to establish liability under the Eighth Amendment           On the issue of her vulnerability, Greene has presented\nfor a prison official’s failure to protect her, an inmate must       evidence which includes the following: a Protective Control\ndemonstrate that the official was deliberately indifferent “to       Screening form signed by Warden Brigano on March 17,\na substantial risk of serious harm” to the inmate. Farmer v.         1994, noting that Greene was placed in the PCU for her\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 828 (1994). To demonstrate                    personal safety; numerous Protective Control Review forms\ndeliberate indifference, an inmate must present evidence from        signed by Warden Brigano noting Greene’s physical\nwhich a trier of fact could conclude “that the official was          appearance as the reason for her placement in the PCU;\nsubjectively aware of the risk” and “disregard[ed] that risk by      Warden Brigano’s own deposition testimony that\nfailing to take reasonable measures to abate it.” Id at 829,         transgendered inmates are often placed in protective custody\n847. As noted above, the only issue before this court is             because of the greater likelihood of their being attacked by\nwhether Greene introduced sufficient evidence to convince a          their fellow inmates; Warden Brigano’s admission that the\ntrier of fact that Warden Brigano was aware of a substantial         universe of harm that can befall inmates like Greene includes\nrisk of serious harm to Greene. That awareness can be                attempted assault, assault, attempted murder, and murder; and\ndemonstrated through “inference from circumstantial                  Warden Brigano’s concessions that Greene was placed in the\nevidence,” and a prison official cannot “escape liability . . . by   PCU to protect her from serious harm and that that serious\nshowing that, while he was aware of an obvious, substantial          harm could come from a fellow PCU inmate as well as an\nrisk to inmate safety, he did not know that the complainant          inmate in the general population. On the issue of Frezzell’s\nwas especially likely to be assaulted by the specific prisoner       predatory nature, Greene has presented to the district court:\nwho eventually committed the assault.” Id. at 842-43. Our            Frezzell’s lengthy prison misconduct record, including\ncases following Farmer demonstrate that the converse is true         Frezzell’s two convictions for felonious assault arising out of\nas well: where a specific individual poses a risk to a large         the Lucasville prison riot; Warden Brigano’s admission of\nclass of inmates, that risk can also support a finding of            Frezzell’s status as a predatory inmate; Warden Brigano’s\nliability even where the particular prisoner at risk is not          concessions that Frezzell had “a long institutional history of\nknown in advance.

In order to prevail on her claim of deliberate\nindifference, Greene must show that Warden Brigano himself                 Because material questions of fact remain as to Warden\nwas aware of a substantial risk to her safety and did not take           Brigano’s knowledge of a substantial risk to Greene, we\nreasonable steps to guard against that risk.

We therefore REVERSE the\ntherefore have no preclusive effect on Greene’s claim against            district court’s judgment AND REMAND for further\nWarden Brigano. Warden Brigano’s reliance on Klemencic                   proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nv. Ohio State University, 263 F.3d 504 (6th Cir. 2001), is\nunavailing. Klemencic dealt with a Title IX claim of quid-\npro-quo sexual harrassment against a coach and his university\nemployer.2 The district court had granted summary judgment\nin favor of the university, and a jury had given a verdict in\nfavor of the defendant coach. The plaintiff appealed from the\ngrant of summary judgment, and a panel of this court found\nthat the jury verdict precluded a claim against the university.\nIn doing so, however, the court clearly relied on the elements\nof a claim against an educational institution: 1) that a\nplaintiff was subject to harassment; 2) that she provided\nactual notice to the institution; and 3) that the institution’s\nresponse amounted to deliberate indifference. See id. at 510\n(citing Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274\n(1998)).

Although the Eighth           particularly so for transgendered inmates. The fact that\nAmendment requires prison officials to maintain humane              Warden Brigano recognized the existence of certain risks\nconditions of confinement, a prison official’s actions do not       attendant with the placement of certain categories of inmates\nviolate the Eighth Amendment unless they are shown to be            in protective custody, however, does not amount to an\ndeliberately indifferent. Deliberate indifference means that        awareness of a significant risk of harm to Greene’s health or\nthe prison official had actual knowledge of a substantial risk      safety. The Eighth Amendment requires, instead, that a\nto inmate health or safety and ignored that risk or proceeded       warden actually recognize a significant risk of harm arising\nin the face of it. Because Greene has failed to show that           from particular facts. While the majority properly states that,\nWarden Brigano was deliberately indifferent to the risk posed       in some contexts, a particular victim, or a particular\nto her by Frezzell’s presence in the protective custody unit, I     perpetrator, need not be known, general recognition of some\nrespectfully dissent.                                               risks is not enough.\n  The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual             This is borne out by the very example given by the\npunishment imposes a duty on prison officials to provide            Supreme Court as sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact:\nhumane conditions of confinement and to take reasonable\nmeasures to guarantee the safety of inmates. Farmer v.                For example, if an Eighth Amendment plaintiff presents\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994). As the Supreme Court               evidence showing that a substantial risk of inmate attacks\nhas explained, however, a prison official’s actions or                was longstanding, pervasive, well-documented, or\nomissions do not trigger liability under the Eighth                   expressly noted by prison officials in the past, and the\nAmendment without a finding of deliberate indifference,               circumstances suggest that the defendant-official being\nwhich is the equivalent of “recklessly disregarding” a risk.          sued had been exposed to information concerning the\nId. at 835. Under the Supreme Court’s clear instruction in            risk and thus must have known about it, then such\nFarmer, Greene must establish not only that Warden Brigano            evidence could be sufficient to permit a trier of fact to\nwas aware of facts from which one could raise the inference           find that the defendant-official had actual knowledge of\nof a substantial risk of harm to her safety, but also that            the risk.\nWarden Brigano, in fact, drew that inference. Id. at 837. This\nrequirement exists because the Eighth Amendment does not            Id. at 842-43 (internal quotations omitted). The evidence in\nextend liability to a prison official’s failure to exercise due     this case cannot fairly be characterized as comparable to the\ncare, but only extends liability to such willful disregard as can   Supreme Court’s example.\nbe considered the infliction of punishment.\n                                                                      Greene first contends that her feminine appearance made it\n  The only evidence cited by Greene that suggests that              obvious that she was vulnerable to attack by other inmates.\nWarden Brigano actually drew the inference that Greene              Warden Brigano was aware of this risk, and that was the\nfaced a substantial risk of harm in the protective custody unit     reason that Greene was assigned to protective custody.\n\fNo. 02-3626                     Greene v.

Greene has clearly failed to establish a\nand sexual advances in her direction made it obvious that she     triable issue as to Warden Brigano’s awareness in this case.\nwas at a substantial risk to her health and safety. While\nGreene has adduced facts indicating the existence of the risk,       Moreover, the majority takes a position that will make it\nshe certainly has failed to show that Warden Brigano ever         more difficult for prison officials to deal with the complicated\ndrew the inference that these facts constituted such a risk. As   issues involved in incarcerating pre-operative transsexual\nto Frizzell’s conduct, although Warden Brigano was aware          inmates. These inmates may not be well-suited to the general\nthat Frizzell had a disciplinary record indicating some           populations of either men’s or women’s institutions, and\npredatory conduct, Warden Brigano also indicated that his         protective custody may be a warden’s best alternative to\nimpression of Frizzell’s demeanor was “nothing out of the         provide for the safety and security of transsexual inmates.\nordinary.” As to Greene’s allegations of Frizzell’s sexual        The majority’s broad position that protective custody poses\nadvances, she has not indicated that Brigano was ever even        obvious harms to transsexual inmates could impel\naware of Frizzell’s conduct in that regard. Without showing       correctional officials to avoid liability for harms to these\nsome particular facts that should have triggered alarm bells in   inmates by either placing all transsexual inmates in individual\nWarden Brigano’s mind, based on his knowledge and                 isolation or by building prisons solely for transsexuals. The\nexperience, Greene has not raised a material issue of fact as     Eighth Amendment cannot be read to compel such a result.\nto Warden Brigano’s awareness of the risk to her safety.\n   Moreover, although the majority does not reach the issue,\nGreene’s claim should fail if she cannot show that Warden\nBrigano actually disregarded the risk. Greene maintains that\nWarden Brigano’s recognition of the risks she faced in the\ngeneral population should have triggered an awareness of\ncommensurate risks in protective custody and that when he\nfailed to provide additional protections, he was deliberately\nindifferent. This claim must fail, because Farmer makes it\nclear that a prison official’s duty under the Eighth\nAmendment is only to insure “reasonable safety,” and this\nstandard “incorporates due regard for prison officials’\n‘unenviable task of keeping dangerous men in safe custody\nunder humane conditions.’” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844-45.\n  The effect of the majority’s opinion in this case is to\nimpose an objective standard of deliberate indifference—a\nposition explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court. See\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 837. Although a reasonable person may\nwell have reached the conclusion based on this body of facts\nthat Greene was in danger, the appropriate test is whether\nWarden Brigano reached the conclusion that Greene was in\n\f",
