HULTEEN ET AL.\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 07–543.      Argued December 10, 2008—Decided May 18, 2009\nPetitioner companies (collectively, AT&T) long based pension calcula\n  tions on a seniority system that relied on years of service minus un\n  credited leave time, giving less retirement credit for pregnancy ab\n  sences than for medical leave generally. In response to the ruling in\n  General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, that such differential\n  treatment of pregnancy leave was not sex-based discrimination pro\n  hibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Congress added\n  the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to Title VII in 1978 to make\n  it “clear that it is discriminatory to treat pregnancy-related condi\n  tions less favorably than other medical conditions,” Newport News\n  Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 684. On the\n  PDA’s effective date, AT&T replaced its old plan with the Anticipated\n  Disability Plan, which provided the same service credit for pregnancy\n  leave as for other disabilities prospectively, but did not make any ret\n  roactive adjustments for the pre-PDA personnel policies. Each of the\n  individual respondents therefore received less service credit for her\n  pre-PDA pregnancy leave than she would have for general disability\n  leave, resulting in a reduction in her total employment term and,\n  consequently, smaller AT&T pensions. They, along with their union,\n  also a respondent, filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n  charges alleging discrimination based on sex and pregnancy in viola\n  tion of Title VII. The EEOC issued each respondent (collectively,\n  Hulteen) a determination letter finding reasonable cause to believe\n  AT&T had discriminated and a right-to-sue letter. Hulteen filed suit\n  in the District Court, which held itself bound by a Ninth Circuit\n  precedent finding a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement\n  eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that dif\n  ferentiated based on pregnancy. The Circuit affirmed.\n\f2                     AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\nHeld: An employer does not necessarily violate the PDA when it pays\n pension benefits calculated in part under an accrual rule, applied\n only pre-PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy than for\n medical leave generally. Because AT&T’s pension payments accord\n with a bona fide seniority system’s terms, they are insulated from\n challenge under Title VII §703(h). Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) AT&T’s benefit calculation rule is protected by §703(h), which\n provides: “[I]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an\n employer to apply different standards of compensation . . . pursuant\n to a bona fide seniority . . . system . . . provided that such differences\n are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of . . . sex.”\n In Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324, 356, the Court held that\n a pre-Title VII seniority system that disproportionately advantaged\n white, as against minority, employees nevertheless exemplified a\n bona fide system without any discriminatory terms under §703(h),\n where the discrimination resulted from the employer’s hiring prac\n tices and job assignments. Because AT&T’s system must also be\n viewed as bona fide, i.e., as a system having no discriminatory terms,\n §703(h) controls the result here, just as it did in Teamsters. This\n Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit\n for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on\n the basis of sex. As a matter of law, at that time, “an exclusion of\n pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage\n [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.” 429 U. S., at 136.\n The only way to conclude that §703(h) does not protect AT&T’s sys\n tem would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharac\n terize AT&T’s acts as having been illegal when done. This is not a\n serious possibility. Generally, there is “a presumption against retro\n activity [unless] Congress itself has affirmatively considered the po\n tential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is\n an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.” Landgraf\n v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 272–273. There is no such clear\n intent here. Section 706(e)(2)—which details when “an unlawful em\n ployment practice occurs, with respect to a seniority system that has\n been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose”—has no\n application because Gilbert unquestionably held that the feature of\n AT&T’s seniority system at issue here was not discriminatory when\n adopted, let alone intentionally so. Nor can it be argued that because\n AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA preg\n nancy leave when Hulteen retired, its failure to do so was facially\n discriminatory at that time. If a choice to rely on a favorable statute\n turned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination,\n §703(h) would never apply. Finally, Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S.\n 385—in which a pre-Title VII compensation plan giving black em\n\f                      Cite as: 556 U.

AT&T’s pre-PDA decision\n  not to award Hulteen service credit for pregnancy leave was not dis\n  criminatory, with the consequence that Hulteen has not been “af\n  fected by application of a discriminatory compensation decision or\n  other practice.” Pp. 13–14.\n498 F. 3d 1001, reversed.\n\n  SOUTER, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS,\nC.

S. C.\n§2000e(k), when it pays pension benefits calculated in part\nunder an accrual rule, applied only prior to the PDA, that\ngave less retirement credit for pregnancy leave than for\nmedical leave generally. We hold there is no necessary\nviolation; and the benefit calculation rule in this case is\npart of a bona fide seniority system under §703(h) of Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–\n2(h), which insulates it from challenge.\n                            I\n  Since 1914, AT&T Corporation (then American Tele\nphone & Telegraph Company) and its Bell System Operat\ning Companies, including Pacific Telephone and Telegraph\nCompany (hereinafter, collectively, AT&T),1 have provided\n——————\n  1 In 1982, a consent decree and Modified Final Judgment (MFJ) were\n\nentered to resolve the Government’s antitrust suit against American\nTelephone & Telegraph Company. The MFJ resulted in the break-up of\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph and the divestiture of the local Bell\nSystem Operating Companies, including Pacific Telephone and Tele\n\f2                     AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npensions and other benefits based on a seniority system\nthat relies upon an employee’s term of employment, un\nderstood as the period of service at the company minus\nuncredited leave time.2\n   In the 1960s and early to mid-1970s, AT&T employees\non “disability” leave got full service credit for the entire\nperiods of absence, but those who took “personal” leaves of\nabsence received maximum service credit of 30 days.\nLeave for pregnancy was treated as personal, not disabil\nity. AT&T altered this practice in 1977 by adopting its\nMaternity Payment Plan (MPP), entitling pregnant em\nployees to disability benefits and service credit for up to\nsix weeks of leave. If the absence went beyond six weeks,\nhowever, it was treated as personal leave, with no further\nbenefits or credit, whereas employees out on disability\nunrelated to pregnancy continued to receive full service\ncredit for the duration of absence. This differential treat\nment of pregnancy leave, under both the pre-1977 plan\nand the MPP, was lawful: in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert,\n429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court concluded that a disability\nbenefit plan excluding disabilities related to pregnancy\n——————\ngraph Company (PT&T). Many employees of the former Bell System\nOperating Companies became employees of the new AT&T Corporation.\nThe Plan of Reorganization, approved by the United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, United States v. Western Elec. Co.,\n569 F. Supp. 1057, aff’d sub nom. California v. United States, 464 U. S.\n1013 (1983), provided that “all employees will carry with them all pre\ndivestiture Bell System service regardless of the organizational unit or\ncorporation by which they are employed immediately after divestiture.”\nApp. 54. Respondents in this case were employed at PT&T. After the\ndivestiture of the Bell Operating Companies in 1984, these women\nbecame employees of AT&T Corporation and their service calculations,\nas computed by PT&T under its accrual rules, were carried over to\nAT&T Corporation.\n  2 AT&T’s calculation of a term of employment is a more complicated\n\nendeavor, requiring the creation and maintenance of an individual\n“start date” for each employee, which is adjusted based on the relevant\nleave policy.\n\f                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)           3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwas not sex-based discrimination within the meaning of\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq.\n   In 1978, Congress amended Title VII by passing the\nPDA, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k), which super\nseded Gilbert so as to make it “clear that it is discrimina\ntory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably\nthan other medical conditions.” Newport News Shipbuild\ning & Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669, 684 (1983).\nOn April 29, 1979, the effective date of the PDA, AT&T\nadopted its Anticipated Disability Plan which replaced the\nMPP and provided service credit for pregnancy leave on\nthe same basis as leave taken for other temporary disabili\nties. AT&T did not, however, make any retroactive ad\njustments to the service credit calculations of women who\nhad been subject to the pre-PDA personnel policies.\n   Four of those women are named respondents in this\ncase. Each of them received less service credit for preg\nnancy leave than she would have accrued on the same\nleave for disability: seven months less for Noreen Hulteen;\nabout six months for Eleanora Collet; and about two for\nElizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.             Respondents\nHulteen, Collet, and Snyder have retired from AT&T;\nrespondent Porter has yet to. If her total term of employ\nment had not been decreased due to her pregnancy leave,\neach would be entitled to a greater pension benefit.\n   Eventually, each of the individual respondents and\nrespondent Communications Workers of America (CWA),\nthe collective-bargaining representative for the majority of\nAT&T’s nonmanagement employees, filed charges of dis\ncrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC), alleging discrimination on the basis\nof sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII. In 1998, the\nEEOC issued a Letter of Determination finding reasonable\ncause to believe that AT&T had discriminated against\nrespondent Hulteen and “a class of other similarly\n\f4                 AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nsituated female employees whose adjusted [commence\nment of service] date has been used to determine eligibil\nity for a service or disability pension, the amount of pen\nsion benefits, and eligibility for certain other benefits and\nprograms, including early retirement offerings.” App. 54–\n55. The EEOC issued a notice of right to sue to each\nnamed respondent and the CWA (collectively, Hulteen),\nand Hulteen filed suit in the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of California.\n   On dueling motions for summary judgment, the District\nCourt held itself bound by a prior Ninth Circuit decision,\nPallas v. Pacific Bell, 940 F. 2d 1324 (1991), which found a\nTitle VII violation where post-PDA retirement eligibility\ncalculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that\ndifferentiated on the basis of pregnancy. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 121a–122a. The Circuit, en banc, affirmed and\nheld that Pallas’s conclusion that “calculation of service\ncredit excluding time spent on pregnancy leave violates\nTitle VII was, and is, correct.” 498 F. 3d 1001, 1003\n(2007).\n   The Ninth Circuit’s decision directly conflicts with the\nholdings of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that reliance on\na pre-PDA differential accrual rule to determine pension\nbenefits does not constitute a current violation of Title VII.\nSee Ameritech Benefit Plan Comm. v. Communication\nWorkers of Am., 220 F. 3d 814 (CA7 2000) (finding no\nactionable Title VII violation given the existence of a bona\nfide seniority system); Leffman v. Sprint Corp., 481 F. 3d\n428 (CA6 2007) (characterizing claim as challenging the\ncontinuing effects of past discrimination rather than\nalleging a current Title VII violation). We granted certio\nrari in order to resolve this split, 554 U. S. __ (2008), and\nnow reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.\n                            II\n    Title VII makes it an “unlawful employment practice”\n\f                 Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)            5\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nfor an employer “to discriminate against any individual\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s . . .\nsex.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). Generally, a claim under\nTitle VII must be filed “within one hundred and eighty\ndays after the alleged unlawful employment practice\noccurred,” §2000e–5(e)(1). In this case, Hulteen has iden\ntified the challenged practice as applying the terms of\nAT&T’s seniority system to calculate and pay pension\nbenefits to women who took pregnancy leaves before April\n29, 1979. She says the claim is timely because the old\nservice credit differential for pregnancy leave was carried\nforward through the system’s calculations so as to produce\nan effect in the amount of the benefit when payments\nbegan.\n   There is no question that the payment of pension bene\nfits in this case is a function of a seniority system, given\nthe fact that calculating benefits under the pension plan\ndepends in part on an employee’s term of employment. As\nwe have said, “[a] ‘seniority system’ is a scheme that, alone\nor in tandem with non-‘seniority’ criteria, allots to employ\nees ever improving employment rights and benefits as\ntheir relative lengths of pertinent employment increase.”\nCalifornia Brewers Assn. v. Bryant, 444 U. S. 598, 605–\n606 (1980) (footnote omitted). Hulteen is also undoubtedly\ncorrect that AT&T’s personnel policies affecting the calcu\nlation of any employee’s start date should be considered\n“ancillary rules” and elements of the system, necessary for\nit to operate at all, being rules that “define which passages\nof time will ‘count’ towards the accrual of seniority and\nwhich will not.” Id., at 607.\n   But contrary to Hulteen’s position, establishing the\ncontinuity of a seniority system whose results depend in\npart on obsolete rules entailing disadvantage to once\npregnant employees does not resolve this case. Although\nadopting a service credit rule unfavorable to those out on\n\f6                     AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\npregnancy leave would violate Title VII today, a seniority\nsystem does not necessarily violate the statute when it\ngives current effect to such rules that operated before the\nPDA. “[S]eniority systems are afforded special treatment\nunder Title VII,” Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,\n432 U. S. 63, 81 (1977), reflecting Congress’s understand\ning that their stability is valuable in its own right. Hence,\n§703(h):\n     “Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchap\n     ter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice\n     for an employer to apply different standards of com\n     pensation, or different terms, conditions, or privileges\n     of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority . . .\n     system . . . provided that such differences are not the\n     result of an intention to discriminate because of race,\n     color, religion, sex, or national origin . . . .” 42 U. S. C.\n     §2000e–2(h).\nBenefit differentials produced by a bona fide seniority\nbased pension plan are permitted unless they are “the\nresult of an intention to discriminate.” Ibid.3\n——————\n   3 Section 701(k) of Title VII provides that “women affected by preg\n\nnancy, . . . shall be treated the same for all employment-related pur\nposes, including receipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as\nother persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to\nwork, and nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to\npermit otherwise.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k). Hulteen contends that, in\nlight of this language, §703(h) does not apply at all to claims of fringe\nbenefit discrimination under the PDA. We cannot agree. Hulteen’s\nreading would result in the odd scenario that pregnancy discrimination,\nalone among all categories of discrimination (race, color, religion, other\nsex-based claims, and national origin), would receive dispensation from\nthe general application of subsection (h).\n   A better explanation is that §701(k) refers only to the final sentence\nof §703(h), which reads that “[i]t shall not be an unlawful employment\npractice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon\nthe basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensa\ntion paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differen\n\f                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                      7\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n   In Teamsters v. United States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977),\nadvantages of a seniority system flowed disproportionately\nto white, as against minority, employees, because of an\nemployer’s prior discrimination in job assignments. We\nrecognized that this “disproportionate distribution of\nadvantages does in a very real sense operate to freeze the\nstatus quo of prior discriminatory employment practices[,]\n[b]ut both the literal terms of §703(h) and the legislative\nhistory of Title VII demonstrate that Congress considered\nthis very effect of many seniority systems and extended a\nmeasure of immunity to them.” Id., at 350 (internal quota\ntion marks omitted). “[T]he unmistakable purpose of\n§703(h) was to make clear that the routine application of a\nbona fide seniority system would not be unlawful under\nTitle VII.” Id., at 352. The seniority system in Teamsters\nexemplified a bona fide system without any discriminatory\nterms (the discrimination having occurred in executive\naction hiring employees and assigning jobs), so that the\nCourt could conclude that the system “did not have its\ngenesis in . . . discrimination, and . . . has been maintained\nfree from any illegal purpose.” Id., at 356.\n   AT&T’s system must also be viewed as bona fide, that\n\n—————— \n\ntiation is authorized by the provisions of section 206(d) of title 29.” 42\n\nU. S. C. §2000e–2(h). This final sentence of subsection (h), referred to\nas the Bennett Amendment, served to reconcile the Equal Pay Act of\n1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U. S. C. §206(d), with Title VII. See County of\nWashington v. Gunther, 452 U. S. 161, 194 (1981) (Rehnquist, J.,\ndissenting). In General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125 (1976), this\nCourt had concluded that the amendment permitted wage discrimina\ntion based on pregnancy. Id., at 144–145. By adding the language,\n“nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to permit\notherwise,” to the PDA, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k), Congress wanted to\nensure that, in addition to replacing Gilbert with a rule that discrimi\nnation on the basis of pregnancy is sex discrimination, it foreclosed the\npossibility that this Court’s interpretation of the Bennett Amendment\ncould be construed, going forward, to permit wage discrimination based\non pregnancy.\n\f8                     AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nis, as a system that has no discriminatory terms, with the\nconsequence that subsection (h) controls the result here,\njust as in Teamsters. It is true that in this case the pre-\nApril 29, 1979 rule of differential treatment was an ele\nment of the seniority system itself; but it did not taint the\nsystem under the terms of subsection (h), because this\nCourt held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the\nseniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not\nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex. As a matter of\nlaw, at that time, “an exclusion of pregnancy from a dis\nability-benefits plan providing general coverage [was] not\na gender-based discrimination at all.” 429 U. S., at 136.4\nAlthough the PDA would have made it discriminatory to\ncontinue the accrual policies of the old rule, AT&T\namended that rule as of the effective date of the Act, April\n29, 1979; the new one, treating pregnancy and other tem\nporary disabilities the same way, remains a part of\nAT&T’s seniority system today.\n   This account of litigation, legislation, and the evolution\nof the system’s terms is the answer to Hulteen’s argument\nthat Teamsters supports her position. She correctly points\nout that a “seniority system that perpetuates the effects of\n\n——————\n  4 Gilbert recognized that differential treatment could still represent\n\nintentionally discriminatory treatment if pretextual, 429 U. S., at 136,\nand that a forbidden discriminatory effect could result if a disability\nbenefits plan produced overall preferential treatment for one sex, id., at\n138. Neither theory is advanced here.\n  In Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U. S. 136 (1977), we reaffirmed our\nholding in Gilbert that Title VII “did not require that greater economic\nbenefits be paid to one sex or the other ‘because of their differing roles\nin “the scheme of human existence.” ’ ” Id., at 142 (quoting Gilbert,\nsupra, at 139, n. 17). But we noted that Gilbert’s holding did not\nextend to “permit an employer to burden female employees in such a\nway as to deprive them of employment opportunities because of their\ndifferent role.” Satty, supra, at 142. Cancellation of benefits previously\naccrued, therefore, was considered facially violative at the time, but\nsuch a situation is not presented here.\n\f                     Cite as: 556 U. S. ____ (2009)                   9\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\npre-Act discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent to\ndiscriminate entered into its very adoption,” 431 U. S., at\n346, n. 28, and she would characterize AT&T’s seniority\nsystem as intentionally discriminatory, on the theory that\nthe accrual rule for pregnancy leave was facially discrimi\nnatory from the start. She claims further support from\nAutomobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U. S.\n187 (1991), in which we said that “explicit facial discrimi\nnation does not depend on why the employer discriminates\nbut rather on the explicit terms of the discrimination,” and\nthat such facial discrimination is intentional discrimina\ntion even if not based on any underlying malevolence. Id.,\nat 199. Hulteen accordingly claims that the superseded\ndifferential affecting current benefits was, and remains,\n“discriminatory in precisely the way the PDA prohibits,”\nBrief for Respondents 18.\n   But Automobile Workers is not on point. The policy in\nthat case, prohibiting women from working in jobs with\nlead exposure unless they could show themselves incapa\nble of child bearing, was put in place after the PDA be\ncame law and under its terms was facially discriminatory.\nIn this case, however, AT&T’s intent when it adopted the\npregnancy leave rule (before the PDA) was to give differ\nential treatment that as a matter of law, as Gilbert held,\nwas not gender-based discrimination. Because AT&T’s\ndifferential accrual rule was therefore a permissible dif\nferentiation given the law at the time, there was nothing\nin the seniority system at odds with the subsection (h)\nbona fide requirement. The consequence is that subsec\ntion (h) is as applicable here as it was in Teamsters, and\nthe calculations of credited service that determine pen\nsions are the results of a permissibly different standard\nunder subsection (h) today.5\n——————\n  5 Although certain circuit courts had previously concluded that treat\n\ning pregnancy leave less favorably than other disability leave consti\n\f10                    AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n  The only way to conclude here that the subsection would\nnot support the application of AT&T’s system would be to\nread the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize\nthe acts as having been illegal when done, contra Gilbert.6\nBut this is not a serious possibility. As we have said,\n     “[b]ecause it accords with widely held intuitions about\n     how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption\n     against retroactivity will generally coincide with legis\n     lative and public expectations. Requiring clear intent\n     assures that Congress itself has affirmatively consid\n     ered the potential unfairness of retroactive applica\n     tion and determined that it is an acceptable price to\n     pay for the countervailing benefits.” Landgraf v. USI\n     Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 272–273 (1994).\nThere is no such clear intent here, indeed, no indication at\nall that Congress had retroactive application in mind; the\nevidence points the other way. Congress provided for the\nPDA to take effect on the date of enactment, except in its\napplication to certain benefit programs, as to which effec\ntiveness was held back 180 days. Act of Oct. 31, 1978,\n§2(b), 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k) (1979 ed.). The\nHouse Report adverted to these benefit schemes:\n     “As the Gilbert decision permits employers to exclude\n——————\ntuted sex discrimination under Title VII, this Court in Gilbert clearly\nrejected that conclusion, 429 U. S., at 147 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see\nalso id., at 162 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Gilbert declared the meaning\nand scope of sex discrimination under Title VII and held that previous\nviews to the contrary were wrong as a matter of law. And “[a] judicial\nconstruction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the\nstatute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise\nto that construction.” Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298,\n312–313 (1994); see also id., at 313, n. 12. It is therefore to no avail to\nargue that the pregnancy leave cap was unlawful before Gilbert and\nthat the PDA returned the law to its prior state.\n  6 In so saying, we assume that §701(k) has no application, as ex\n\nplained in footnote 3, supra.

R. Rep. No. 95–948, p. 8 (1978).\nThis is the language of prospective intent, not retrospec\ntive revision.\n   Hulteen argues that she nonetheless has a challenge to\nAT&T’s current payment of pension benefits under\n§706(e)(2) of Title VII, believing (again mistakenly) that\nthis subsection affects the validity of any arrangement\npredating the PDA that would be facially discriminatory if\ninstituted today. Brief for Respondents 27–29. Section\n706(e)(2) provides that\n    “an unlawful employment practice occurs, with re\n    spect to a seniority system that has been adopted for\n    an intentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of\n    this subchapter (whether or not that discriminatory\n    purpose is apparent on the face of the seniority provi\n    sion), when the seniority system is adopted, when an\n    individual becomes subject to the seniority system, or\n    when a person aggrieved is injured by the application\n    of the seniority system or provision of the system.” 42\n    U. S. C. §2000e–5(e)(2).\nBut, as the text makes clear, this subsection determines\nthe moments at which a seniority system violates Title VII\nonly if it is a system “adopted for an intentionally dis\ncriminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter.” As\ndiscussed above, the Court has unquestionably held that\nthe feature of AT&T’s seniority system at issue was not\ndiscriminatory when adopted, let alone intentionally so in\nviolation of this subchapter. That leaves §706(e)(2) with\n\f12                    AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nout any application here.\n   It is equally unsound for Hulteen to argue that when\nshe retired AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA\ncredit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave, making its failure to\ndo so facially discriminatory at that time.7 If a choice to\nrely on a favorable statute turned every past differentia\ntion into contemporary discrimination, subsection (h)\nwould never apply.\n   Hulteen’s remaining argument (as of the time the case\nwas submitted to us) is that our decision in Bazemore v.\nFriday, 478 U. S. 385 (1986) (per curiam), is on her side.\nIn Bazemore, black employees of the North Carolina Agri\ncultural Extension Service, who received less pay than\ncomparable whites under a differential compensation plan\nextending back to pre-Title VII segregation, brought suit\nin 1971 claiming that pay disparities persisted. Id., at\n389–391. We concluded that “[a] pattern or practice that\nwould have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the\nfact that the statute had not yet become effective, became\na violation upon Title VII’s effective date, and to the ex\ntent an employer continued to engage in that act or prac\ntice, it is liable under that statute.” Id., at 395.\n   Bazemore has nothing to say here. To begin with, it did\nnot involve a seniority system subject to subsection (h);\nrather, the employer in Bazemore had a racially based pay\nstructure under which black employees were paid less\nthan white employees. Further, after Title VII became\nlaw, the employer failed to eliminate the discriminatory\npractice, even though the new statute had turned what\nonce was legally permissible into something unlawful.\nBazemore would be on point only if, after the PDA, AT&T\n\n——————\n  7 Tothe extent Hulteen means to claim, as a factual matter, that the\naccrual rule was merely advisory, requiring a fresh choice to apply it in\nthe benefit context, she points to nothing in the record supporting such\na proposition.\n\f                 Cite as: 556 U.

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U. S. 618\n(2007), and dealing specifically with discrimination in\ncompensation:\n    “For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment\n    practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in com\n    pensation in violation of this title, when a discrimina\n    tory compensation decision or other practice is\n    adopted, when an individual becomes subject to a dis\n    criminatory compensation decision or other practice,\n    or when an individual is affected by application of a\n    discriminatory compensation decision or other prac\n    tice, including each time wages, benefits, or other\n    compensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part\n    from such a decision or other practice.” Lilly Ledbetter\n    Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. 111–2, §3(A), 123 Stat.\n    5–6.\nHulteen argues that payment of the pension benefits at\nissue in this case marks the moment at which she “is\naffected by application of a discriminatory compensation\ndecision or other practice,” and she reads the statute as\nproviding that such a “decision or other practice” may not\nbe applied to her disadvantage.\n  But the answer to this claim is essentially the same as\nthe answer to Hulteen’s argument that §706(e)(2) helps\nher, supra, at 11–12. For the reasons already discussed,\n\f14                AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nAT&T’s pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service\ncredit for pregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with\nthe consequence that Hulteen has not been “affected by\napplication of a discriminatory compensation decision or\nother practice.” §3(A), 123 Stat. 6.\n                             IV\n   Bona fide seniority systems allow, among other\nthings, for predictable financial consequences, both for the\nemployer who pays the bill and for the employee who gets\nthe benefit. Cf. Central Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Heinz,\n541 U. S. 739, 743 (2004) (noting that the central feature\nof the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\n29 U. S. C. §1001 et seq., is its “object of protecting em\nployees’ justified expectations of receiving the benefits\ntheir employers promise them”). As §703(h) demonstrates,\nCongress recognized the salience of these reliance inter\nests and, where not based upon or resulting from an inten\ntion to discriminate, gave them protection. Because the\nseniority system run by AT&T is bona fide, the judgment\nof the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.\n\n                                            It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 556 U.

Less\nthan two years after the Court’s ruling, Congress passed\nthe Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 (PDA) to over\nturn Gilbert and make plain the legislators’ clear under\nstanding that discrimination based on pregnancy is dis\ncrimination against women.3 The Act amended Title VII\nto require that women affected by pregnancy “be treated\nthe same for all employment-related purposes, including\nreceipt of benefits under fringe benefit programs, as other\npersons not so affected but similar in their ability or in\nability to work.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k).\n   The PDA does not require redress for past discrimina\ntion. It does not oblige employers to make women whole\nfor the compensation denied them when, prior to the Act,\nthey were placed on pregnancy leave, often while still\nready, willing, and able to work, and with no secure right\nto return to their jobs after childbirth.4 But the PDA does\n——————\n  3 See, e.g., H.

S., at 694 (Rehnquist, J., dissent\ning) (criticizing the Court for concluding that the PDA\n“renders all of Gilbert obsolete”).\n   Today’s case presents a question of time. As the Court\ncomprehends the PDA, even after the effective date of the\nAct, lower pension benefits perpetually can be paid to\nwomen whose pregnancy leaves predated the PDA. As to\nthose women, the Court reasons, the disadvantageous\ntreatment remains as Gilbert declared it to be: “facially\nnondiscriminatory,” and without “any gender-based dis\ncriminatory effect,” 429 U. S., at 138. See ante, at 8.\n   There is another way to read the PDA, one better at\ntuned to Congress’ “unambiguou[s] . . . disapproval of both\nthe holding and the reasoning” in Gilbert. Newport News,\n462 U. S., at 678. On this reading, the Act calls for an\nimmediate end to any pretense that classification on the\nbasis of pregnancy can be “facially nondiscriminatory.”\n\f6                 AT&T CORP. v. HULTEEN\n\n                   GINSBURG, J., dissenting\n\nWhile the PDA does not reach back to redress discrimina\ntion women encountered before Congress overruled Gil\nbert, the Act instructs employers forthwith to cease and\ndesist: From and after the PDA’s effective date, classifica\ntions treating pregnancy disadvantageously must be\nrecognized, “for all employment-related purposes,” includ\ning pension payments, as discriminatory both on their face\nand in their impact. So comprehended, the PDA requires\nAT&T to pay Noreen Hulteen and others similarly\nsituated pension benefits untainted by pregnancy-based\ndiscrimination.\n                              II\n   The Court’s rejection of plaintiffs’ claims to pension\nbenefits undiminished by discrimination “because of\n[their] sex,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(h), centers on §703(h) of\nTitle VII, as construed by this Court in Teamsters v.\nUnited States, 431 U. S. 324 (1977). See ante, at 4–8.\nSection 703(h) permits employers “to apply different stan\ndards of compensation . . . pursuant to a bona fide senior\nity . . . system.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(h). Congress en\nacted §703(h), Teamsters explained, to “exten[d] a measure\nof immunity” to seniority systems even when they “operate\nto ‘freeze’ the status quo of prior discriminatory employ\nment practices.” 431 U. S., at 350 (quoting Griggs v. Duke\nPower Co., 401 U. S. 424, 430 (1971)).\n   Teamsters involved a seniority system attacked under\nTitle VII as perpetuating race-based discrimination.\nMinority group members ranked low on the seniority list\nbecause, pre-Title VII, they were locked out of the job\ncategory in question. But the seniority system itself, the\nCourt reasoned, “did not have its genesis in . . . discrimi\nnation,” contained no discriminatory terms, and applied\n“equally to all races and ethnic groups,” 431 U. S., at 355–\n356. Therefore, the Court concluded, §703(h) sheltered the\nsystem despite its adverse impact on minority group\n\f                      Cite as: 556 U.

See id., at 356.\n   This case differs from Teamsters because AT&T’s senior\nity system itself was infected by an overt differential. Cf.\nante, at 8 (“[R]ule of differential treatment was an element\nof the seniority system itself . . . .”). One could scarcely\nmaintain that AT&T’s scheme was “neutral on [its] face\nand in intent,” discriminating against women only “in\neffect.” Cf. Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 349. Surely not a\nterm fairly described as “equally [applicable] to all,” id., at\n355, AT&T’s prescription regarding pregnancy leave\nwould gain no immunity under §703(h) but for this Court’s\nastonishing declaration in Gilbert: “[E]xclusion of preg\nnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general\ncoverage,” the Court decreed, “[was] not a gender-based\ndiscrimination at all.” 429 U. S., at 136. See ante, at 8\n(because of Gilbert, AT&T’s disadvantageous treatment of\npregnancy leave “did not taint the system under the terms\nof [§703(h)]”).\n   Were the PDA an ordinary instance of legislative revi\nsion by Congress in response to this Court’s construction\nof a statutory text, I would not dissent from today’s deci\nsion. But Congress made plain its view that Gilbert was\nnot simply wrong about the character of a classification\nthat treats leave necessitated by pregnancy and childbirth\ndisadvantageously.

Congress did not provide a remedy for pregnancy\nbased discrimination already experienced before the PDA\nbecame effective.

Seeking equal treatment only from and after the\nPDA’s effective date, plaintiffs present modest claims. As\nthe Court observes, they seek service credit, for pension\nbenefit purposes, for the periods of their pregnancy leaves.\nFor the named plaintiffs, whose claims are typical, the\nuncounted leave days are these: “seven months . . . for\nNoreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet;\nand about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.”\nAnte, at 3. See also 498 F. 3d 1001, 1004 (CA9 2007) (en\nbanc) (case below). Their demands can be met without\ndisturbing settled expectations of other workers, the core\nconcern underlying the shelter §703(h) provides for senior\nity systems. See Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co., 424 U. S.\n747, 766, 773, and n. 33 (1976) (“ ‘benefit’ seniority,” unlike\n“ ‘competitive status’ seniority,” does not conflict with\neconomic interests of other employees).\n    Furthermore, as Judge Rymer explained in her opinion\ndissenting from the Ninth Circuit’s initial panel opinion,\n441 F. 3d 653, 665–666 (2006), the relief plaintiffs request\nis not retroactive in character.

The actionable conduct of which they complain is\nAT&T’s denial of equal benefits to plaintiffs “in the post-\nPDA world.” Id., at 667.\n   Nor does it appear that equal benefits for plaintiffs\nduring their retirement years would expose AT&T to an\nexcessive or unmanageable cost. The plaintiffs’ class is\nnot large; it comprises only women whose pregnancy\nleaves predated April 29, 1979 and whose employment\ncontinued long enough for their pensions to vest. The\nperiods of service involved are short—several weeks or\nsome months, not years. And the cost of equal treatment\nwould be spread out over many years, as eligible women\nretire.\n                              IV\n   Certain attitudes about pregnancy and childbirth,\nthroughout human history, have sustained pervasive,\noften law-sanctioned, restrictions on a woman’s place\namong paid workers and active citizens.

The Court’s opinion\nfeatured Congress’ recognition that,\n    “[h]istorically, denial or curtailment of women’s em\n    ployment opportunities has been traceable directly to\n    the pervasive presumption that women are mothers\n    first, and workers second.

In an exorbitant concurring opinion, Justice Bradley wrote that\n“the female sex [is] evidently unfi[t] . . . for many of the occupations of\ncivil life.” 16 Wall., at 141.

Martin\nMarietta Corp., 400 U. S. 542 (1971) (per curiam), how\never, rejected similar reasoning. At issue in Phillips was\nan employer’s refusal to hire mothers of pre-school-age\nchildren. Phillips yielded a per curiam opinion recogniz\ning that Title VII applies to classifications disadvanta\ngeous to some, but not most, women.

On the\n  PDA’s effective date, AT&T replaced its old plan with the Anticipated\n  Disability Plan, which provided the same service credit for pregnancy\n  leave as for other disabilities prospectively, but did not make any ret\n  roactive adjustments for the pre-PDA personnel policies. Each of the\n  individual respondents therefore received less service credit for her\n  pre-PDA pregnancy leave than she would have for general disability\n  leave, resulting in a reduction in her total employment term and,\n  consequently, smaller AT&T pensions. They, along with their union,\n  also a respondent, filed Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n  charges alleging discrimination based on sex and pregnancy in viola\n  tion of Title VII. The EEOC issued each respondent (collectively,\n  Hulteen) a determination letter finding reasonable cause to believe\n  AT&T had discriminated and a right-to-sue letter. Hulteen filed suit\n  in the District Court, which held itself bound by a Ninth Circuit\n  precedent finding a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement\n  eligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that dif\n  ferentiated based on pregnancy.

Because AT&T’s pension payments accord\n with a bona fide seniority system’s terms, they are insulated from\n challenge under Title VII §703(h). Pp. 4–14.\n    (a) AT&T’s benefit calculation rule is protected by §703(h), which\n provides: “[I]t shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an\n employer to apply different standards of compensation . . . pursuant\n to a bona fide seniority . . . system . . . provided that such differences\n are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of . . . sex.”\n In Teamsters v.

Because AT&T’s system must also be\n viewed as bona fide, i.e., as a system having no discriminatory terms,\n §703(h) controls the result here, just as it did in Teamsters. This\n Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit\n for time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on\n the basis of sex. As a matter of law, at that time, “an exclusion of\n pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general coverage\n [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.” 429 U. S., at 136.\n The only way to conclude that §703(h) does not protect AT&T’s sys\n tem would be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharac\n terize AT&T’s acts as having been illegal when done. This is not a\n serious possibility. Generally, there is “a presumption against retro\n activity [unless] Congress itself has affirmatively considered the po\n tential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is\n an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.” Landgraf\n v.

AT&T did not, however, make any retroactive ad\njustments to the service credit calculations of women who\nhad been subject to the pre-PDA personnel policies.\n   Four of those women are named respondents in this\ncase.

Generally, a claim under\nTitle VII must be filed “within one hundred and eighty\ndays after the alleged unlawful employment practice\noccurred,” §2000e–5(e)(1). In this case, Hulteen has iden\ntified the challenged practice as applying the terms of\nAT&T’s seniority system to calculate and pay pension\nbenefits to women who took pregnancy leaves before April\n29, 1979. She says the claim is timely because the old\nservice credit differential for pregnancy leave was carried\nforward through the system’s calculations so as to produce\nan effect in the amount of the benefit when payments\nbegan.\n   There is no question that the payment of pension bene\nfits in this case is a function of a seniority system, given\nthe fact that calculating benefits under the pension plan\ndepends in part on an employee’s term of employment.

Id.,\nat 199. Hulteen accordingly claims that the superseded\ndifferential affecting current benefits was, and remains,\n“discriminatory in precisely the way the PDA prohibits,”\nBrief for Respondents 18.\n   But Automobile Workers is not on point. The policy in\nthat case, prohibiting women from working in jobs with\nlead exposure unless they could show themselves incapa\nble of child bearing, was put in place after the PDA be\ncame law and under its terms was facially discriminatory.\nIn this case, however, AT&T’s intent when it adopted the\npregnancy leave rule (before the PDA) was to give differ\nential treatment that as a matter of law, as Gilbert held,\nwas not gender-based discrimination. Because AT&T’s\ndifferential accrual rule was therefore a permissible dif\nferentiation given the law at the time, there was nothing\nin the seniority system at odds with the subsection (h)\nbona fide requirement. The consequence is that subsec\ntion (h) is as applicable here as it was in Teamsters, and\nthe calculations of credited service that determine pen\nsions are the results of a permissibly different standard\nunder subsection (h) today.5\n——————\n  5 Although certain circuit courts had previously concluded that treat\n\ning pregnancy leave less favorably than other disability leave consti\n\f10                    AT&T CORP. v.

As we have said,\n     “[b]ecause it accords with widely held intuitions about\n     how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption\n     against retroactivity will generally coincide with legis\n     lative and public expectations.

To begin with, it did\nnot involve a seniority system subject to subsection (h);\nrather, the employer in Bazemore had a racially based pay\nstructure under which black employees were paid less\nthan white employees. Further, after Title VII became\nlaw, the employer failed to eliminate the discriminatory\npractice, even though the new statute had turned what\nonce was legally permissible into something unlawful.\nBazemore would be on point only if, after the PDA, AT&T\n\n——————\n  7 Tothe extent Hulteen means to claim, as a factual matter, that the\naccrual rule was merely advisory, requiring a fresh choice to apply it in\nthe benefit context, she points to nothing in the record supporting such\na proposition.\n\f                 Cite as: 556 U.

See id., at 356.\n   This case differs from Teamsters because AT&T’s senior\nity system itself was infected by an overt differential. Cf.\nante, at 8 (“[R]ule of differential treatment was an element\nof the seniority system itself . . . .”). One could scarcely\nmaintain that AT&T’s scheme was “neutral on [its] face\nand in intent,” discriminating against women only “in\neffect.” Cf. Teamsters, 431 U. S., at 349. Surely not a\nterm fairly described as “equally [applicable] to all,” id., at\n355, AT&T’s prescription regarding pregnancy leave\nwould gain no immunity under §703(h) but for this Court’s\nastonishing declaration in Gilbert: “[E]xclusion of preg\nnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing general\ncoverage,” the Court decreed, “[was] not a gender-based\ndiscrimination at all.” 429 U. S., at 136. See ante, at 8\n(because of Gilbert, AT&T’s disadvantageous treatment of\npregnancy leave “did not taint the system under the terms\nof [§703(h)]”).\n   Were the PDA an ordinary instance of legislative revi\nsion by Congress in response to this Court’s construction\nof a statutory text, I would not dissent from today’s deci\nsion. But Congress made plain its view that Gilbert was\nnot simply wrong about the character of a classification\nthat treats leave necessitated by pregnancy and childbirth\ndisadvantageously.

Congress did not provide a remedy for pregnancy\nbased discrimination already experienced before the PDA\nbecame effective.

As\nthe Court observes, they seek service credit, for pension\nbenefit purposes, for the periods of their pregnancy leaves.\nFor the named plaintiffs, whose claims are typical, the\nuncounted leave days are these: “seven months . . . for\nNoreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora Collet;\nand about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.”\nAnte, at 3.

At issue in Phillips was\nan employer’s refusal to hire mothers of pre-school-age\nchildren.

In response to an employer’s argument that\nits disadvantageous maternity leave and pregnancy dis\nability income protection policies were not based on sex,\nthe court commented: “[I]t might appear to the lay mind\nthat we are treading on the brink of a precipice of absurd\nity. Perhaps the admonition of Professor Thomas Reed\nPowell to his law students is apt; ‘If you can think of some\nthing which is inextricably related to some other thing and\nnot think of the other thing, you have a legal mind.’ ” Id.,\nat 1157.\n   Congress put the Court back on track in 1978 when it\namended Title VII to repudiate Gilbert’s holding and\nreasoning. See Newport News, 462 U. S., at 678; Califor\nnia Fed., 479 U. S., at 284–285; supra, at 4–5.17 Congress’\n——————\n  16 See also the EEOC’s Guideline, initially published in 1965, and now\ncodified in 29 CFR §1604.4:\n“The Commission has determined that an employer’s rule which forbids\nor restricts the employment of married women and which is not appli\ncable to married men is a discrimination based on sex prohibited by\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act. It does not seem to us relevant that\nthe rule is not directed against all females, but only against married\nfemales, for so long as sex is a factor in the application of the rule, such\napplication involves a discrimination based on sex.” 30 Fed. Reg. 14928\n(1965).\n  17 For critical commentary on Gilbert and its forerunner, Geduldig v.\n\nAiello, see, e.g., Bartlett, Pregnancy and the Constitution: The Unique\nness Trap, 62 Calif. L.

They must continue to experience the impact of\ntheir employer’s discriminatory—but, for a short time,\nGilbert-blessed—plan. That outcome is far from inevita\nble. It is at least reasonable to read the PDA to say, from\nand after the effective date of the Act, no woman’s pension\npayments are to be diminished by the pretense that preg\nnancy-based discrimination displays no gender bias.\n  I would construe the Act to embrace plaintiffs’ com\nplaint, and would explicitly overrule Gilbert so that the\ndecision can generate no more mischief.\n                      *     *   *\n  For the reasons stated, I would affirm the Ninth Cir\ncuit’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n——————\nGeneral Electric Co. v.
