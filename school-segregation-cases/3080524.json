The plaintiff, BTS, USA, Inc., appeals\nfrom the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor\nof the defendants, Executive Perspectives, LLC (EP),\nand Marshall Bergmann, on its claims against them for\nviolation of the Connecticut Uniform Trade Secrets Act\n(CUTSA); General Statutes § 35-50 et seq.; and the Con-\nnecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act; General Statutes\n§ 42-110a et seq.; and tortious interference with the\nplaintiff’s business relationships, and on its claim\nagainst Bergmann for breach of his employment con-\ntract with the plaintiff and against EP for tortious inter-\nference with that employment contract. On appeal, the\nplaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion by\n(1) precluding it from inspecting an adequate sampling\nof EP’s products; (2) determining that the name and\nidentity of the plaintiff’s vendor was not a trade secret;\n(3) denying its request for injunctive relief; (4) finding\nthat it had maintained its CUTSA claims in bad faith;\nand (5) awarding attorney’s fees to EP without distin-\nguishing the fees associated with its colorable claims\nfrom the claims found to have been made in bad faith.\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court,1 are\nrelevant to this appeal. ‘‘[The plaintiff] is part of a Swed-\nish based international corporation which designs and\nmarkets training simulations, experiential educational\nexercises and related products to business and industry.\nThe products include business simulations designed\nto educate and train client employees, whether upper\nmanagement, middle management or front office work-\ners. There are essentially three types of product[s]:\nlearning maps, computer simulations, and board games.\nThe products can be sold ‘as is’ or they can be custo-\nmized to varying degrees. As needed, a simulation can\nbe designed almost from scratch to suit the specific\nmodel or needs of the client. The president of [the\nplaintiff] is Jonas Akerman.\n   ‘‘EP is a direct competitor of [the plaintiff]. EP designs\nand sells the same types of product to the same types\nof clients, with the exception of learning maps. EP\ndoes not have any learning map type products in its\ninventory. It does however have both computer simula-\ntions and board game products. EP can also sell product\n‘as is’ or can customize the product to whatever extent\nis necessary to meet the needs of the client. Although\na direct competitor of [the plaintiff], EP is much smaller\nthan [the plaintiff]. The president of EP is John Wells.\n  ‘‘EP has been in business since 1983. EP has changed\nnames and has changed hands a few times over the\nyears but in 2004, John Wells and John Thomas (both\ncofounders of the company in 1983) reacquired the\nbusiness and all of its assets. The court credits the\ntestimony of Wells that throughout its existence, EP’s\n\fsimulation technology has gone largely unchanged and\nrelies in large measure on the original technology\nacquired in 1983. Although it has expanded with time,\nthe inventory of products has been unchanged, for the\nmost part, since approximately 2009. EP has always\nhad the ability and the manpower to customize its simu-\nlations. EP has had board game simulations in its inven-\ntory for many years. EP has not created any new\nproducts or simulations since approximately 2009.\n   ‘‘The court further finds, crediting the testimony of\nWells and the documentary evidence offered by the\ndefendants, that as of the filing of this lawsuit, most of\nthis information was known to [the plaintiff]. In 2008,\n[the plaintiff] considered acquiring EP. As a result, sub-\nject to a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement,\n[the plaintiff]’s financial advisors and [the plaintiff]\nwere given access to much of EP’s proprietary informa-\ntion. EP disclosed details of its corporate structure;\npersonnel; sales history; client information; capabilities;\nliabilities and other information pertinent to a determi-\nnation as to whether it was a good prospect for acquisi-\ntion. During this time, Wells and Akerman had\ndiscussions about EP’s capabilities to include the scope\nand range of its customization ability. Ultimately, [the\nplaintiff] determined not to proceed.2\n   ‘‘Marshall Bergmann was employed by [the plaintiff]\nfrom 2005 until mid-June, 2010. He was a senior director\nat the time he left. As such, he had access to much of [the\nplaintiff]’s proprietary information and was involved in\nmany of the proprietary processes, i.e., product pricing\n. . . [of the plaintiff]. When Bergmann began work\n. . . [for the plaintiff], he signed an employment con-\ntract which contained a number of restrictions, to\ninclude a noncompete clause upon his departure. Mate-\nrial to the plaintiff’s claim that the contract was\nbreached by Bergmann and/or interfered with by EP\nare the following provisions:\n   ‘‘ ‘2.1 Employee shall not for a period of two (2) years\nimmediately following the end of the Employee’s active\nduties with Employer, either directly or indirectly,\neither for himself or for any other person, company or\nother business entity:\n  ‘‘ ‘a. Make known or otherwise make available to\nany person, company, and/or other business entity the\nnames and addresses of any clients (whether the corpo-\nrate entity or the individuals employed by such corpo-\nrate entity) of Employer or any other information\npertaining to them;\n  ‘‘ ‘b. Call on, solicit, or take away, or attempt to call\non, solicit, or take away or communicate in any manner\nwhatsoever, with any of the clients of Employer;\n  ‘‘ ‘c. Call on, solicit, or take away, or attempt to call\non, solicit, or take away or communicate in any manner\nwhatsoever, with any of the clients of Employer on\n\fbehalf of any business which directly competes with\nemployer.\n  ‘‘ ‘2.2 For the purposes of this Agreement, clients shall\nbe defined as any person, company or other business\nentity whom the Employer has performed work or ser-\nvices for, solicited business and/or collected monies\nfrom, with the twelve month period immediately pre-\nceding the end of the Employee’s active duties with\nthe Employer.’\n  ‘‘While [working for the plaintiff], Bergmann was\ninvolved in an effort to do business with the Royal Bank\nof Canada (RBC). Ultimately, RBC decided not to do\nbusiness with [the plaintiff] and decided to give the\nbusiness to a Canadian business school. RBC turned\ndown [the plaintiff]’s offer in June, 2010. Prior to 2010,\nRBC was not a client of [the plaintiff]. [The plaintiff]\nhad not previously done any business with RBC.\n   ‘‘Also in June, 2010, Bergmann accepted a job offer\nfrom EP to work in its New York office. He gave two\nweeks’ notice to [the plaintiff]. He did not tell [the\nplaintiff] that he was going to work for a competitor.\nBergmann testified that he did not take any contact\nlists, client lists, vendor lists or other . . . . informa-\ntion with him when he left. This testimony is credited.\nFurther, Wells testified that Bergmann did not share\n[the plaintiff’s] client lists, client information, technol-\nogy, product information, pricing strategies or other\nproprietary information. Nor did EP solicit any such\ninformation from Bergmann upon his arrival or at any\ntime thereafter. This court finds Wells’ testimony\ncredible.\n   ‘‘Shortly after he began work at EP, Bergmann posted\nhis new job to his LinkedIn account. Those to whom\nhe was ‘linked’ on this social media could have received\na notification of this posting. Whether a ‘linked’ individ-\nual received notice of the posting or not would depend\non the particular settings selected by that person. One\nof the tasks given Bergmann when he joined EP was\nto improve and revamp the EP website, which he did.\nUpon completion he posted an invitation to ‘check out’\nthe new website via his LinkedIn account. Some of the\nindividuals to whom Bergmann was ‘linked’ were clients\nand contacts he had developed while [working for the\nplaintiff]. He did not ‘unlink’ these people when he left\n[the plaintiff’s employ]. He was not asked to do so. He\nnever had any discussions with anyone at BTS about\nhis LinkedIn account. In fact, many people [employed\nby the plaintiff] have similar LinkedIn accounts and are\nstill linked to Bergmann.\n  ‘‘Shortly after he began work at EP, Bergmann con-\ntacted Liz Carreiro and Jan Wilmott, both of whom\nworked at RBC. Carreiro and Wilmott were the contacts\nat RBC Bergmann dealt with when trying to sell the\n[plaintiff’s] product/project shortly before his departure\n\ffrom [its employ]. He had known Jan Wilmott for years,\nto include a time when Wilmott did not work at RBC.\nIn his correspondence, Bergmann advised RBC that he\nhad taken a new job with EP and he attempted to meet\nwith and discuss EP’s capabilities for possible business\nin the future. The correspondence was clearly designed\nto get business with RBC for EP, something readily\nacknowledged by Bergmann in his testimony. The cor-\nrespondence also included some comparisons between\nEP and [the plaintiff], which were unfavorable to [the\nplaintiff] as well as some arguably disparaging com-\nments about [the plaintiff]. The communications did\nnot contain any proprietary information belonging to\n[the plaintff] and did not make reference to any such\ninformation. Ultimately, RBC did not do any business\nwith EP. In fact, to date, RBC has done no business\nwith EP. Bergmann’s last correspondence or contact\nwith RBC occurred in November, 2010.\n  ‘‘Conversely, after Bergmann left [the plaintiff’s\nemploy], Akerman maintained regular contact with\nRBC. [The plaintiff] continued in discussions with RBC\nand in 2013, sold RBC an education/training product.\nDuring that process, [the plaintiff] initially quoted a\nparticular price to RBC. RBC responded that the price\nwas too high. As a result, [the plaintiff] developed differ-\nent options by which RBC could obtain the same result\nor objective but which would be less costly. The product\nwas scaled back in some respects in order to achieve\nthese cost savings. Ultimately, RBC chose one of the\noptions developed by [the plaintiff]. This option was\n$73,000 less expensive than the originally quoted prod-\nuct proposal. [The plaintiff] provided the work/product\nto RBC and to this day enjoys a good business relation-\nship with RBC. . . .\n   ‘‘While at EP, within two years of his arrival, Berg-\nmann was assigned to work in the field at Hewlett\nPackard (HP). He did not solicit HP and did not have\nany role in securing the business of HP. He was merely\nassigned to help deliver the product. HP was a client\nof [the plaintiff] as well, though Bergmann never did\nany work for HP while he was [employed by the plain-\ntiff]. HP remains a client of [the plaintiff], and there was\nno evidence that Bergmann’s work on the HP project\nincluded the use of any [of the plaintiff’s] proprietary\nor confidential information. Nor was there evidence\noffered that Bergmann’s work on the HP project had\nany adverse impact on [the plaintiff] or its relationship\nwith HP.\n   ‘‘Richard Kelly is one of EP’s independent contractors\nin Australia. He is also a former employee of BTS, Aus-\ntralia, Inc. Kelly left BTS Australia in February, 2009.\nAfter he left BTS Australia, he went to work for a firm\ncalled AJ Lucas. While at AJ Lucas, he had discussions\nwith BTS Australia about BTS Australia providing a\nproduct/training exercise to AJ Lucas. In connection\n\fwith those discussions, BTS Australia gave Kelly a ‘par-\nticipant kit’ for one of its learning map products called\n‘Conductor.’ The kit was contained within a cardboard\nbox, which was designed to look like a large envelope.\nIt also bore artwork specific to the Conductor game.\nKelly, individually or on behalf of AJ Lucas, was not\nasked to enter into a confidentiality agreement with\nrespect to the participant kit. He was not advised that\neither the box or its contents were proprietary or that\nthey were not to be shared with anyone else. Although\nAJ Lucas ultimately determined not to do business with\nBTS Australia, no one at BTS Australia asked Kelly to\nreturn the participants kit or the box in which it was\nhoused. In sum, the box and the kit were given away\nby BTS [Australia] to AJ Lucas as a potential client\nwithout any restrictions. When Kelly left his employ-\nment with AJ Lucas, he took the box and the participant\nkit home.\n   ‘‘In 2010, Kelly contacted EP about possible employ-\nment opportunities. He was hired as an independent\ncontractor for marketing and sales of EP’s inventory\nof products in Australia. Also in 2010, EP was thinking\nabout changing its packaging for one of its board game\nproducts, ‘Takeoff,’ and perhaps ‘Wild Fire,’ as well.\nDuring a discussion on this issue, Kelly advised EP that\nthe box used by [the plaintiff] might be of interest.\nThereafter, he took a photograph of the outside of the\n‘Conductor’ box he had received when he was at AJ\nLucas and sent the photographs to EP. EP then did a\nmock-up of its own art work for a similar style box.\nBergmann advised EP that Ironwood Lithographers was\nthe vendor that [the plaintiff] used for its packaging.\nHe gave Kelly Snider, at EP, the name of Jay Topczewski\nas a point of contact at Ironwood and told her to men-\ntion his name as the reference. [The plaintiff’s] employ-\nees, to include Bergmann, were never told that vendor\nnames are proprietary and not to be shared. Bergmann’s\nemployment contract, which contained a lengthy\ndescription of information deemed ‘confidential,’ did\nnot include the names of vendors as subject to its non-\ndisclosure provisions.\n  ‘‘Snider contacted Topczewski by e-mail to inquire\nabout a quote for packaging. She sent the EP mock-up\nas well as the photographs of the ‘Conductor’ partici-\npant kit box. Topczewski did not believe that he could\nor should be using the [the plaintiff’s] packaging as a\nbase design for EP. He declined to do business with EP\nand advised [the plaintiff] of his interactions with EP.\n   ‘‘All of the events which purport to comprise the\ntortious conduct complained of occurred in the latter\nsix months of 2010. And notwithstanding these events,\n[the plaintiff] continues to enjoy an excellent and ongo-\ning business relationship with Ironwood; RBC changed\nfrom being a prospective client of [the plaintiff] to an\nactual client; RBC and [the plaintiff] enjoy an ongoing\n\fbusiness relationship; RBC never gave any business to\nEP; EP has done no business with Ironwood; EP never\nchanged its ‘Take Off’ or ‘Wildfire’ packaging.’’3 (Foot-\nnotes altered.)\n   On the basis of these factual findings, the court con-\ncluded: ‘‘With these facts found, it is manifest that the\nplaintiff’s evidence is so lacking that the determination\nthat the plaintiff has failed in its burden of proof is\ncompletely unremarkable.’’4 (Footnote altered.) The\ncourt further found that the ‘‘[p]laintiff’s theory of dam-\nages is factually and legally unfounded.’’ The court thus\nrendered judgment in favor of the defendants on all\nfive counts of the plaintiff’s complaint. The court also\nfound that the plaintiff’s CUTSA claim, although ‘‘color-\nable at the outset, portions of it became objectively\nspecious shortly into the discovery process,’’ and thus\nthat the plaintiff’s insistence in maintaining certain of\nthose claims was motivated by improper purposes. Pur-\nsuant to General Statutes § 35-54, on the basis of that\ndetermination, the court awarded attorney’s fees to EP\nin the amount of $171,203.40.5 This appeal followed.\nAdditional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n                             I\n   The plaintiff first claims that the trial court abused\nits discretion in not permitting it to inspect an adequate\nnumber of EP’s products to ascertain whether EP had\nmisappropriated trade secrets. We disagree.\n  The following factual and procedural history is rele-\nvant to this claim. On May 7, 2012, the plaintiff served\nupon the defendants a request for inspection seeking\nto have its expert witness inspect six of EP’s products,\nnamely: ‘‘[The following] computer simulations of the\ndefendant [EP] with regard to the (a) user interface,\n(b) programming language and (c) the processing meth-\nodology (including a demonstration by an operator des-\nignated by [EP] for each: (1) ‘Go Figure—Financial\nServices’; (2) ‘Strategic Horizons’; (3) ‘Oil & Gas Per-\nspectives’; (4) ‘Business Perspectives.’ [In addition,\nthese] board simulations/learning maps of [EP]: (1)\n‘Wildfire’ [and] (2) ‘Take-off for Teams.’ ’’\n   On May 14, 2012, the defendants filed an objection\nto the plaintiff’s request to inspect in which they argued,\ninter alia, that: ‘‘Undeterred by the mountain of evidence\nwhich contradicts [the] plaintiff’s speculation, the plain-\ntiff now seeks to accomplish its major objective in this\n[litigation—to acquire] [EP]’s trade secrets. With no\nsolid evidence to rest upon, the plaintiff has filed a\nmotion to inspect [EP]’s important secret products and\ncapabilities. [The] plaintiff seeks access to the com-\nputer programming language that [EP] uses to operate\nits products, as well as [EP]’s processing methodology.\n[The] plaintiff seeks access to these essential trade\nsecrets, even though the evidence clearly shows that\nthe products [the] plaintiff wants to inspect all predated\n\fBergmann’s hire.’’ (Emphasis in original.) The defen-\ndants addressed each of the products that the plaintiff\nsought to inspect, giving reasons as to why the plaintiff’s\nrequest to inspect should be denied, and emphasized\nthat the plaintiff already had received discovery that\nsupported the defendants’ claims and concluded that:\n‘‘[T]his must be the point in this litigation where [EP]’s\nessential trade secrets are deemed worthy of protection\nfrom its competitor. This should be especially so where\nthe evidence which supposedly justifies the disclosure\nor inspection of such trade secrets is totally lacking.\nMere speculation and unsupported allegations should\nnever allow access to competitive trade secrets.’’\n   On May 18, 2012, the plaintiff filed a reply to the\ndefendants’ objection to its request to inspect EP’s prod-\nucts, arguing that the defendants’ objection was actually\na motion for protective order and thus that the defen-\ndants had the burden to ‘‘demonstrate that disclosure\nof allegedly confidential information will work a clearly\ndefined and very serious injury’’ to their business.\n(Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nThe plaintiff argued that the defendants had completely\nfailed to meet this burden and that the parties had\nalready established measures to protect their trade\nsecrets by agreeing to a general protective order.\n   On May 24, 2012, the court, Dubay, J., held a hearing\non the dispute surrounding the plaintiff’s request to\ninspect EP’s products at which counsel for the parties\npresented oral argument. The court ordered, inter alia,\nthe parties to submit proposed orders regarding their\nrespective positions on the parameters of any inspec-\ntion to be conducted of EP’s products, including the\nscope of the inspection and the identity of an expert\nto conduct said inspection. After receiving the parties’\nproposals, the court issued an order on June 19, 2012,\nthat the plaintiff and EP each name an expert and that\nthose two experts confer to agree upon a neutral expert\nto conduct the inspection. The court ordered that if the\nparties could not come to an agreement in that regard,\nthat the parties would submit names of proposed\nexperts to the court and that it would appoint a neutral\nexpert to conduct the inspection; that said expert would\nabide by the protective order previously agreed to by\nthe parties. As to the scope of the inspection, the court\nordered: ‘‘The defendants are to provide the neutral\nexpert with all documentary, electronic and physical\ninformation, and/or access to said information or indi-\nviduals with that information, for the purpose of con-\nducting an inspection of up to twenty percent (20%) of\nthe product offerings of [EP] listed in plaintiff’s motion\nto inspect dated May 14, 2012. The choice as to which\nproducts to be inspected shall be within the sound\ndiscretion of the neutral expert.’’ The court further\nordered: ‘‘Upon the conclusion of the inspection, the\nneutral expert shall prepare and issue an interim report\ndesignated ‘Attorney’s Eyes Only’ directed to counsel\n\ffor the parties. The report shall state in sufficient detail,\nbut without disclosing proprietary information belong-\ning to [EP] or [the plaintiff] the neutral expert’s findings\nwith regard to the neutral expert’s review of each of\nthe products, whether there is a significant similarity\nbetween the products of [EP] and [the plaintiff] and, if\nthere is a similarity, whether the similarity is significant\nenough to give rise to an inference of misappropriation\nof [the plaintiff]’s products by [EP], or whether addi-\ntional inquiry by the neutral expert is warranted in order\nto make such determination.’’\n   The plaintiff thereafter sought clarification of the\ncourt’s June 19, 2012 order, specifically as to the number\nof EP’s products the court was permitting the neutral\nexpert to inspect.6 The court held a hearing on the\nplaintiff’s motion for clarification on July 6, 2012. Pri-\nmarily, the plaintiff sought clarification as to whether\nthe court intended the inspection to encompass 20 per-\ncent of EP’s entire product line, which equated to\napproximately six products, or 20 percent of the six\nproducts that the plaintiff listed in its request to inspect.\nAt the hearing, the court clarified that its order was\nthat the plaintiff could inspect 20 percent of the prod-\nucts that it had listed in its request, not 20 percent\nof EP’s entire product line. Upon hearing the court’s\nclarification, the plaintiff made an oral motion for\nreconsideration of the scope of the inspection to include\nmore than 20 percent of the six products it had listed\nin its request for inspection as that figure would equate\nto only one product. The court explained to counsel\nfor the plaintiff: ‘‘I know that you believe that the scope\nof the audit is insufficient and it may not serve your\npurpose for . . . it certainly doesn’t give you what you\nsought. However, in this case, I was very close to finding\nthat an insufficient showing had been made to allow\nany discovery whatsoever, which was the position that\nwas urged upon me by [counsel for the defendants];\nthat essentially the plaintiff had not made any showing\nin this case which should allow a raid of [20] percent\nof the work product of the defendant. And so . . . I\ndecided that 20 percent of 20 percent, or 4 percent is\nbetter than zero percent.’’ The court permitted the par-\nties to file posthearing memoranda on the plaintiff’s\nmotion to reconsider. On July 19, 2012, the court reaf-\nfirmed its June 19, 2012 order.\n  The parties thereafter reached an impasse in choos-\ning a neutral expert to conduct the inspection, and the\ncourt thus issued an order on August 28, 2012, naming\nsaid expert, Francois Thrower. Thrower conducted his\ninspection and on January 2, 2013, issued his report,\nwherein he explained: ‘‘It is now abundantly clear to\nme that a broader review of EP products is necessary\nto assess the likelihood that the products of EP are\ncopies or derivative works of [the plaintiff’s] products.’’\nThrower opined that the inspection of the court-permit-\nted singular product ‘‘is simply too few products to\n\fdetermine if there are sufficient similarities in products\nand whether technology and know-how have been mis-\nappropriated.’’ Thrower noted that he reviewed two\nversions of EP’s ‘‘Wildfire’’ product. He did not, how-\never, set forth any findings regarding that inspection.\nRather, Thrower explained that a review of ‘‘both com-\nputer and noncomputer-based products including\ngeneric and customized examples is required.’’ He thus\nrequested ‘‘as a starting point’’ to inspect all six of the\nproducts identified in the plaintiff’s May 14, 2012\nrequest for inspection.\n   On January 8, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for\norder seeking to inspect the products identified by\nThrower in his report. The defendants filed an objection\nto that motion, arguing, inter alia, that Thrower had\nnot, on the basis of his inspection of Wildfire, deter-\nmined that they had stolen the plaintiff’s trade secrets,\nbut, rather, Thrower was simply seeking to expand the\nscope of the inspection to obtain more information to\nmake that determination. Thrower did not opine as\nto Wildfire’s similarity, or lack thereof, to any of the\nplaintiff’s products. The court, Dooley, J., held a hearing\non the plaintiff’s motion and the defendant’s objection\non February 13, 2013, at which the plaintiff presented\nthe testimony of Thrower. Thrower testified that, upon\nbeing appointed to conduct the inspection in this case,\nhe first met with the plaintiff to familiarize himself with\ntheir products. Following that meeting, but before meet-\ning with EP to review its product, he sent an e-mail to\nthe parties stating that ‘‘it was not possible for me to\nrender a complete judgment without having a broader\naccess to both sides’ products.’’ He testified that he was\naware that the court had issued an order allowing the\ninspection of only one of EP’s products, which he was\npermitted to choose, but that he had reviewed seven-\nteen of the plaintiff’s products and wanted to ‘‘make a\nsimilar kind of comparison with EP’s products.’’\nThrower testified that he had chosen to inspect Wildfire\nbecause he had learned from the depositions of Wells\nand Bergmann that the packaging of Wildfire had been\na source of contention between the parties. On the basis\nof his inspection, Thrower testified that he could say\nwith a reasonable degree of certainty that there were no\nsimilarities between Wildfire and any of the plaintiff’s\nproducts. Despite that conclusion, however, Thrower\ntestified that he did not have enough information to\nconclude that none of EP’s products are, as the plain-\ntiff’s counsel stated, ‘‘remarkably similar’’ to any of [the\nplaintiff’s] products. On that basis, the plaintiff asked\nthe court to expand the scope of the inspection to\npermit Thrower to inspect more of EP’s products.\n  On February 15, 2013, the court denied the defen-\ndant’s motion for order seeking to inspect additional\nEP products. The court explained: ‘‘It appears to this\ncourt that granting the plaintiff’s motion for order so\nas to allow the further inspection by Mr. Thrower of\n\f[EP]’s products would necessarily require this court to\nrevisit and undo the prior determination of Judge\nDubay. The question[s] of whether, how and to what\nextent [EP]’s products would be inspected by a court-\nappointed expert were thoroughly and aggressively liti-\ngated before Judge Dubay. The outcome of that litiga-\ntion is contained in the court’s order dated June 19,\n2012, as clarified by order dated July 19, 2012. The\ncourt permitted a very limited inspection, which could\npotentially be expanded if the initial limited inspection,\nby virtue of its findings, gave rise to such an expansion.\nMr. Thrower determined that [EP]’s product chosen for\ninspection had absolutely no similarity to any of the\nplaintiff’s products. Thus, by virtue of the court’s prior\ndeterminations, no further inspection is warranted. This\ncourt gives ‘law of the case’ deference to these prior\norders. . . . The fact that Mr. Thrower determined not\nto follow the court’s directive and simply render an\nopinion as to the single product chosen, and chose\ninstead to request greater access so that he might make\na more informed judgment does not change the analysis.\nIt was for the court, following input from both parties,\nto determine the scope of the expert’s assignment and\nthe role he might play in the litigation. His desire to\nplay a different role or to expand the scope of his\nassignment is not reason, at this juncture, to revisit or\nchange Judge Dubay’s decision.’’\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court abused\nits discretion in permitting it to inspect only one of EP’s\nproducts because the defendants failed to show good\ncause to limit the plaintiff’s discovery request pursuant\nto Practice Book § 13-5. Our Supreme Court has stated,\n‘‘We have long recognized that the granting or denial\nof a discovery request rests in the sound discretion of\nthe [trial] court, and is subject to reversal only if such\nan order constitutes an abuse of that discretion. . . .\n[I]t is only in rare instances that the trial court’s decision\nwill be disturbed. . . . That ample discretion is limited,\nhowever, by the provisions of the rules [of practice]\npertaining to discovery; Practice Book §§ 217–221 [now\n§§ 13-2 through 13-5]; especially the mandatory provi-\nsion that discovery shall be permitted if the disclosure\nsought would be of assistance in the prosecution or\ndefense of the action. . . . The [party] opposing . . .\nretains the ability [however] to object to such requests\nby any number of procedural vehicles, including written\nobjection, motion to quash, motion to limit, or motion\nfor a protective order. See Practice Book § 13-5 . . . .\nThe court, in its discretion, may grant or deny such\nobjections as it deems appropriate.’’ (Citations omitted;\nemphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nBrody v. Brody, 153 Conn. App. 625, 637–38, 103 A.3d\n981, cert. denied, 315 Conn. 910, 105 A.3d 901 (2014).\n  Here, on the basis of the arguments of the defendants,\nthe court determined that it was limiting the scope of\nthe inspection on the basis of the weakness of the\n\fplaintiff’s argument that the allegations of their com-\nplaint were based upon anything more than mere specu-\nlation. Although the plaintiff claims that the court\nabused its discretion in limiting the scope of its inspec-\ntion of EP’s products, it has not challenged as erroneous\nthe basis for the court’s limitation on that inspection,\nthe court’s determination that the plaintiff’s request for\ninspection was based upon speculative allegations of\nthe misappropriation of trade secrets. On the basis of\nthe defendants’ arguments that the plaintiff’s allegations\nwere based solely upon speculation, the court remarked\nthat it was very close to denying the request for inspec-\ntion altogether. On the basis of the court’s finding in\nthis regard, the court acted well within its discretion\nin limiting the scope of the inspection.\n   The plaintiff also claims that the court abused its\ndiscretion in deferring to Judge Dubay’s limitation of\nthe scope of the inspection as ‘‘the law of the case.’’\n‘‘The law of the case doctrine provides that [w]here a\nmatter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily,\nthe court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may\ntreat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the\nopinion that the issue was correctly decided, in the\nabsence of some new or overriding circumstance.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Here, it is\nclear from the court’s explanation of its denial of the\nplaintiff’s motion for order permitting the inspection of\nadditional EP products that the court found that Judge\nDubay had correctly decided the plaintiff’s earlier, heav-\nily litigated request to inspect EP’s products and the\nobjection filed by EP and that no new or overriding\ncircumstance had arisen that would form the basis for\nan expansion of that order. Thus, the plaintiff’s claim\nthat the court abused its discretion in this regard also\nmust fail.\n                             II\n  The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in\ndetermining that the name and identity of the plaintiff’s\nvendor was not a trade secret. We disagree.\n   ‘‘The question of whether information sought to be\nprotected by [CUTSA] rises to the level of a trade secret\nis one of fact for the trial court. . . . [When] the factual\nbasis of the court’s decision is challenged we must\ndetermine whether the facts set out in the memorandum\nof decision are supported by the evidence or whether,\nin light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole\nrecord, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . . In other\nwords, to the extent that the trial court has made find-\nings of fact, our review is limited to deciding whether\nthose findings were clearly erroneous. . . . A finding\nof fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence\nin the record to support it . . . or when although there\nis evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the\n\fentire evidence is left with the definite and firm convic-\ntion that a mistake has been committed. . . . In making\nthis determination, every reasonable presumption must\nbe given in favor of the trial court’s ruling. . . .\n   ‘‘With respect to what constitutes a trade secret, the\nmeaning of that term is set forth at General Statutes\n§ 35-51 (d). Under that statutory subsection, trade\nsecret is defined as information, including a formula,\npattern, compilation, program, device, method, tech-\nnique, process, drawing, cost data or customer list that:\n(1) Derives independent economic value, actual or\npotential, from not being generally known to, and not\nbeing readily ascertainable by proper means by, other\npersons who can obtain economic value from its disclo-\nsure or use, and (2) is the subject of efforts that are\nreasonable under the circumstances to maintain its\nsecrecy. General Statutes § 35-51 (d).’’ (Citations omit-\nted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Lydall, Inc. v.\nRuschmeyer, 282 Conn. 209, 220–21, 919 A.2d 421\n(2007). Accordingly, to make out a prima facie case\nfor a violation of CUTSA, the plaintiff was required to\npresent sufficient evidence that, if believed, would\nprove that its ‘‘vendor information consisting of the\nunpublished name and e-mail address of the vendor\nrepresentative . . . Topczewski,’’ had independent\neconomic value and that the plaintiff made reasonable\nefforts to maintain the secrecy of his identity.\n   Here, the trial court found: ‘‘The plaintiff also failed\nto establish that the name of the vendor who makes\nthe packaging is a trade secret. [The plaintiff’s] employ-\nees, to include Bergmann, were never told that vendor\nnames are proprietary and not to be shared. Bergmann’s\nemployment contract, which contained a lengthy\ndescription of information deemed ‘confidential,’ did\nnot include the names of vendors as subject to its non-\ndisclosure provisions. The fact that Bergmann told\nSnider to use his name further supports the conclusion\nthat Bergmann was under no obligation to keep [the\nplaintiff’s] vendor names secret. Ironwood was identi-\nfied as a partner of [the plaintiff’s] predecessor in inter-\nest, The Real Learning Company, in that company’s\nwebsite. Ironwood has no contractual obligation or\nunderstanding with [the plaintiff] that it must keep its\nstatus as the [the plaintiff’s] box maker a secret. [The\nplaintiff] discloses Ironwood as its printer/vendor on\nthose occasions that Ironwood is required to speak\ndirectly to the client or on those occasions when Iron-\nwood ships the product directly to the client.\n  ‘‘In the face of this evidence, [the plaintiff] offers only\nthe testimony of Akerman that the box and vendors’\nnames are trade secrets. This is not sufficient.\n   ‘‘Furthermore, [the plaintiff] failed to establish that\neither the box or the vendor name was misappropriated\nor obtained through ‘improper means.’ BTS Australia\ngave the box to Kelly when Kelly worked for AJ Lucas.\n\fIt did so without restriction of any sort. It required no\nconfidentiality agreement; did not request its return and\nnever told Kelly the box (or even its content) were\nproprietary or not to be shared. Kelly, who was not\neven an employee of EP at the time, was under no\nobligation or duty to maintain the box’s secrecy. He\ntook it home, where it stayed. Months later, when Kelly\nworked for EP, he took a picture of the outside of the\nbox and sent it to EP. [The plaintiff] offers no evidence\nto contradict these facts. Nor does [the plaintiff] offer\na cogent explanation as to how EP’s possession of the\nphotograph of the outside of the box can be the result\nof ‘misappropriation‘ under these facts.\n   ‘‘Similarly, for the same reasons that the vendor iden-\ntities cannot be considered trade secrets, their use or\ndisclosure cannot constitute misappropriation. Berg-\nmann was not under any duty to maintain the secrecy\nof the vendor’s identities. The names were therefore\nnot obtained through improper means, and their use\nby EP was not misappropriation.’’\n    The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in focus-\ning on the identity of Ironwood, versus the ‘‘unpublished\npersonal contact information for Topczewski’’—that\n‘‘[t]he trial court erred when it failed to address the\nevidence as to the vendor contact information and\ninstead referenced evidence that the identity of Topc-\nzewski’s employer, Ironwood, was not confidential as\na basis for its determination that [the plaintiff]’s vendor\ninformation is not a trade secret.’’ The plaintiff argues,\n‘‘The vendor, Ironwood, does not publish Topczewski’s\nname or e-mail address; therefore, EP could have\nobtained his name and e-mail only through Bergmann.’’\n   The court’s determination that the names of the plain-\ntiff’s vendors did not constitute trade secrets logically\nencompasses the employees of those vendors. The fact\nthat EP discovered Topczewski’s identity and e-mail\naddress from Bergmann does not demonstrate that Ber-\ngmann was the only way that that information could\nhave been obtained, that that information had any inde-\npendent economic value, or that either the plaintiff or\nIronwood itself had taken measures to maintain the\nsecrecy of that information. On the basis of the record\nbefore us, we cannot conclude that the court erred in\ndetermining that the plaintiff’s ‘‘vendor contact informa-\ntion’’ was not a trade secret under CUTSA.\n                             III\n  The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improp-\nerly denied its request for injunctive relief under Gen-\neral Statutes § 35-52 (a). We disagree.\n  The trial court found: ‘‘Alternatively, the plaintiff\nseeks injunctive relief. CUTSA does allow for the grant-\ning of injunctive relief, in appropriate cases, in addition\nto or in lieu of damages . . . § 35-52 (a). However,\nnor has [the] plaintiff established that injunctive relief\n\fis appropriate.\n   ‘‘Bergmann left [the plaintiff’s employ] over four\nyears ago. The last act by Bergmann which is even\narguably a CUTSA violation occurred in November,\n2010. If, arguendo, the RBC solicitation was considered\na CUTSA violation, it was done without malice or\nimproper intent; it was isolated in nature; it caused no\nharm to [the plaintiff]; and it has not been repeated.\nThere is no evidence or indication that Bergmann or\nEP have done anything wrong since that time, and no\nindication that Bergmann or EP intend to use any of\n[the plaintiff]’s confidential information into the future.\n. . . Thus, absent any actual damages or cause for\ninjunctive relief, the CUTSA claim premised upon the\nRBC solicitation also fails.’’ (Citation omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.)\n   Our standard of review of a trial court’s denial of a\nrequest for injunctive relief is well settled. ‘‘The issu-\nance of an injunction and the scope and quantum of\ninjunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the\ntrier. . . . A prayer for injunctive relief is addressed\nto the sound discretion of the court and the court’s\nruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determin-\ning whether the decision was based on an erroneous\nstatement of law or an abuse of discretion.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) Stamford v. Ten Rugby\nStreet, LLC, 164 Conn. App. 49, 73,     A.3d       (2016).\n  Section 35-52 (a) provides: ‘‘Actual or threatened mis-\nappropriation may be enjoined upon application to any\ncourt of competent jurisdiction. An injunction shall be\nterminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist,\nbut the injunction may be continued for an additional\nreasonable period of time in order to eliminate commer-\ncial advantage that otherwise would be derived from\nthe misappropriation.’’\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly\ndenied its claim for injunctive relief on the basis of\nthree allegedly erroneous factual findings. First, the\nplaintiff argues that ‘‘the defendants have a continuing\nduty not to use the plaintiff’s existing trade secrets.’’\nSecond, the plaintiff claims that ‘‘a finding of malice or\nimproper intent is not required for injunctive relief.’’\nThird, the plaintiff contends that ‘‘a finding of threat-\nened misappropriation, not actual, is required for\ninjunctive relief.’’ We need not address the plaintiff’s\narguments in depth, as each of those grounds is easily\ndispatched by the trial court’s determination that the\nplaintiff had presented no evidence whatsoever of any\nwrongdoing by either of the defendants in the past,\nany intended wrongdoing in the future, or any harm\nstemming from any alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff’s\nclaim that the trial court erred in denying its request\nfor injunctive relief is thus without merit.\n                            IV\n\f   The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in\nfinding that it had maintained its CUTSA claims in bad\nfaith.7 We disagree.\n   In determining whether the plaintiff’s CUTSA claims\nwere maintained in bad faith, the trial court set forth\nthe following additional facts. ‘‘[The plaintiff] initially\nclaimed that Kelly misappropriated board game tech-\nnology and processes. This claim was made largely due\nto Akerman’s suspicions that Kelly had done so. Those\nsuspicions purportedly arose out of the coincidental\ntiming regarding Kelly’s departure from [BTS Australia]\nand EP’s addition of board games to its advertised\ninventory. Specifically, Akerman said EP began adver-\ntising board game product on its website in January,\n2009, the same time Kelly had left [BTS Australia] to\ngo to EP. Therefore, Akerman suspected and assumed\nthat Kelly misappropriated board game trade secret\ninformation and gave it to EP in January, 2009. How-\never, not long after this litigation began, that these prem-\nises were factually flawed came to light. First, EP has\nhad board game technology and advertised such (to\ninclude on its website) for many years prior to 2009.\nSecond, Kelly did not leave [BTS Australia] in January,\n2009. He left in February, 2009. Kelly did not go to EP\nfrom [BTS Australia] and had no contact with EP until\nJanuary, 2010. In the interim, he worked for AJ Lucas.\nFurther, the evidence established the [the plaintiff] was\nfully aware that Kelly did not leave until February, 2009,\nand that he did not pursue employment with EP at that\ntime. Indeed, after he left BTS Australia, he discussed\na potential business transaction between AJ Lucas and\nBTS Australia.\n   ‘‘An additional purported justification for pursuing\nthese claims was Akerman’s suspicion that Bergmann\nhad also shared product technology with EP. This suspi-\ncion turns out to be equally flawed and wholly incredi-\nble. Akerman claimed that EP did not have the capacity\nto provide ‘level 2’ customization to its simulation prod-\nucts until Bergmann began working at EP. Therefore, he\nreasoned, Bergmann must have shared that technology\nand processes with EP. However, as found above,\nthroughout its existence, EP has had the ability to cus-\ntomize product to whatever extent was necessary in\norder to meet a client’s needs. A review of the EP\nwebsite going back many years confirms this testimony.\nFurther, as already found above, [the plaintiff] was fully\naware of EP’s ability to perform ‘level 2’ customization\nof its simulations as a result of the information provided\nby Wells and EP during the 2008 due diligence. The\ninformation disclosed by EP during that due diligence\nincluded the extent to which EP’s work involved cus-\ntomization and the time value of its customization busi-\nness. Again, Akerman’s stated ‘suspicions’ as\njustification for this lawsuit were not well founded,\ncould have been debunked with a modicum of due\n\fdiligence and in fact, are not credible.8\n  ‘‘Akerman further testified that in 2010, when it was\nbrought to his attention that EP had contacted Iron-\nwood and appeared to have a ‘Conductor’ participant\nkit, he became further concerned or suspicious of EP.\nHowever, soon into the litigation, [the plaintiff] knew\nthat the box had been given to Kelly by [BTS Australia]\nwithout restriction, while he was at AJ Lucas. [The\nplaintiff] was provided chapter and verse as to the cir-\ncumstances under which the Conductor box and kit\ncame into Kelly’s possession. [The plaintiff] has never\ndeveloped any evidence that the kit itself was ever seen\nor used by EP. Indeed, EP still has no learning map\ntype of product in its inventory.\n   ‘‘Nothwithstanding [the plaintiff]’s actual knowledge\nof when Kelly left, the complete debunking of the\nassumptions about Kelly, and [the plaintiff]’s knowl-\nedge that EP could in fact customize its product before\n2010, [the plaintiff] continued to seek extraordinary\ndiscovery in this case to include all of EP’s product\ntechnology.9 The court (Dubay, J.), recognizing the\ndearth of evidence to support [the plaintiff]’s suspi-\ncions, ordered a very limited review, by a court-\nappointed expert, of a single EP product. The expert\nfound no evidence of any similarity between the EP\nproduct chosen by [the plaintiff] and any of [the plain-\ntiff]’s products. The court (Dooley, J.) thereafter deter-\nmined that no justification existed for a further\nintrusion by [the plaintiff] into EP’s products or prod-\nuct technology.\n   ‘‘On the first day of trial [the plaintiff] advised EP\nand the court that the CUTSA claim would be limited\nand would not include any claim that EP misappropri-\nated product technology. [The plaintiff] did not concede\nthat no evidence existed to support the claim, but\nrather, blamed the court’s ruling restricting access to\nEP’s products, as the reason that it was unable to prove\nits suspicions regarding EP. Notwithstanding [the plain-\ntiff]’s pronouncement on the first day of trial, EP has\noffered voluminous testimony and evidence that no\nsuch misappropriation occurred. It d[id] so not to dis-\nprove the plaintiff’s case, but to advance its own claim\nthat the CUTSA action was brought and maintained in\nbad faith.\n   ‘‘EP’s claim that the CUTSA count was advanced in\nbad faith relies largely on the utter dearth of evidence,\nas outlined above, to support the initial allegations of\nproduct technology misappropriation. [The plaintiff]\nresponds that the lawsuit was only commenced after\na series of events which gave rise to grave concern\nregarding Bergmann and EP, to wit: Bergmann did not\ntell [the plaintiff] he was going to a competitor; [the\nplaintiff] learned that Bergmann was at EP; Bergmann\ncontacted RBC within weeks of joining EP (conduct\nwhich [the plaintiff] believed violated the employment\n\fagreement); Ironwood was contacted by EP and [the\nplaintiff] learned that EP had what appeared to be a\nparticipant kit for one of its learning map products; EP\nrequested a similar packaging design to the one used\nby [the plaintiff] for Conductor. Under these circum-\nstances, [the plaintiff] argues it had legitimate reason\nto believe Bergmann was sharing [the plaintiff’s] propri-\netary information and trade secrets.\n   ‘‘This court agrees that at its inception, the plaintiff\nhad a colorable CUTSA claim. [The plaintiff] had\nreceived sufficient information to give rise to an infer-\nence that EP was in possession of [the plaintiff’s] trade\nsecrets and pursuing the how and the extent of the\nsituation through this litigation was not bad faith on\nthe part of [the plaintiff]. However, not far into the\ndiscovery process, it was abundantly clear that the\nproduct technology claim had no merit. All of [the plain-\ntiff]’s suspicions or concerns regarding product technol-\nogy misappropriation should have been adequately laid\nto rest by the end of 2011. By then, it was abundantly\nclear that EP had not modified nor added to its technol-\nogy or product inventory since approximately 2009,\nlong before Kelly and Bergmann joined EP. This was\nmade clear to [the plaintiff] through discovery requests;\ndeposition testimony; and responses to document\nrequests.\n   ‘‘Further, Akerman’s factual assumptions and suspi-\ncions regarding Kelly were fully debunked by then. Kelly\nwas not hired by EP until 2010, and EP had board games\nlong before Kelly was hired. To the extent that the\nparticipant kit for ‘Conductor’ raised concerns, it was\nalso clear that EP does not have and has never had a\nlearning map type of product. Conductor is a learning\nmap product. For [the plaintiff] to maintain these claims\nafter the discovery process made crystal clear that the\nvery premises upon which his suspicions were purport-\nedly based were factually inaccurate gives rise to an\ninference that the litigation was maintained for\nimproper purposes. Indeed, to date, aside from factually\nflawed premises and the unfounded suspicions of Aker-\nman, [the plaintiff] has offered no explanation for per-\nsisting in its claim of product technology\nmisappropriation.\n   ‘‘In sum, no later than end of 2011, there was simply\nnothing left to justify or explain [the plaintiff]’s persis-\ntence in pursuing the CUTSA claims as to product tech-\nnology. [The plaintiff]’s quest to obtain EP product\ntechnology through discovery and court process, after\ntheir claims were laid bare as meritless, gives rise to\nan inference of improper motive on the part of [the\nplaintiff]. The court finds that [the plaintiff]’s determina-\ntion to maintain the product technology CUTSA claims\nas of the end of calendar year 2011 and through to the\nfirst day of trial was made in bad faith as that term has\nbeen defined by our appellate courts. The court will\n\fhear evidence as to the attorneys fees incurred\ndefending these claims during that time period.\n   ‘‘The claim that the Conductor box was a trade secret\nand was misappropriated was, as found, wholly without\nmerit. Akerman’s testimony, if believed, might have\nestablished that the packaging was considered a trade\nsecret, thus making this claim ‘colorable’ at the incep-\ntion of the litigation. However, in light of the circum-\nstances under which the box and its content came into\nKelly’s possession, i.e., it was given to him by [the plain-\ntiff] without restriction while he was employed at AJ\nLucas, the claim of ‘misappropriation’ as defined by\nCUTSA was demonstrably false and no longer ‘color-\nable’ upon those circumstances coming to light. Main-\ntaining such a claim, under those circumstances,\namounts to bad faith. Those circumstances were known\nto [the plaintiff] (if not before commencement of the\nlitigation) certainly by the end of 2011. The court will\nhear evidence as to the claimed attorney’s fees incurred\ndefending this claim after that date and through trial.\n  ‘‘The claim that the vendor names and contact infor-\nmation, specifically, Ironwood, was a trade secret was\nsupported by scant evidence. However, Akerman did\ntestify that the information is presently not available\nto the public and that [the plaintiff] does not advertise\nor share openly its vendor’s identities. While the court\nfound the evidence lacking in terms of the plaintiff’s\nburden, it was not a claim ‘without color.’\n   ‘‘The claim that the RBC solicitation involved the\nmisappropriation of a trade secret was also, throughout\nthe litigation, a colorable claim. While the court has\nfound that the solicitation itself did not include the use\nof trade secrets such as pricing information, RBC was\na potential client of [the plaintiff]; was an entity [the\nplaintiff] had tried to do business with and clearly hoped\nto do business with in the future. Wilmott and Carreiro\nwere client contacts developed by Bergmann while\n[working for the plaintiff]. Both Wells and Akerman\nagree that potential clients and current clients can be\nproprietary in nature and can be and often are consid-\nered trade secrets. To the extent that Bergmann was\nunder a duty not to disclose such information, his solici-\ntation of RBC on behalf of EP could give rise to a good\nfaith claim of a CUTSA violation. The court did not\nresolve this aspect of the CUTSA claim, however,\nbecause it did not need to do so. The CUTSA claim\npremised upon the RBC solicitation was colorable. That\nthe conduct, for the reasons articulated above, could\nnot be the basis for an award of damages or the granting\nof injunctive relief, does not alter this conclusion. Los-\ning on the merits for these reasons, does not make the\nclaim without color at the time it is brought or tried.\n  ‘‘Whether or not the CUTSA claim was colorable at\nthe outset, portions of it became objectively specious\nshortly into the discovery process. [The plaintiff]’s per-\n\fsistence in maintaining certain of these CUTSA claims,\nto include those which it dropped before trial and one\nwhich it brought to trial (the box), was motivated by\nimproper purposes.’’ (Footnotes altered.)\n   On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the court’s bad\nfaith determination on the grounds that the court ‘‘com-\npletely misapprehend[ed] [its] concerns relating to EP’s\nability to customize its products after Bergmann left\n[its employ] and joined EP in 2010’’ and ‘‘ignore[d]’’\ncertain facts regarding EP’s product upgrades. (Empha-\nsis omitted.) The plaintiff’s arguments in this regard are\nbelied by the trial court’s thorough decision addressing\nthose very issues. The record supports the trial court’s\ndetermination and it is not the role of this court to retry\nthose issues.10 We thus reject the plaintiff’s contention\nthat the trial court’s bad faith determination was\nerroneous.\n                            V\n   The plaintiff finally claims that the trial court erred\nin awarding attorney’s fees to EP on the basis of its\nfinding of bad faith against the plaintiff without appor-\ntioning that award to only the claims found to have\nbeen made in bad faith. We disagree.\n   At the conclusion of its October 16, 2014 memoran-\ndum of decision, the court directed the parties to con-\ntact the court officer to schedule a hearing on the\ndefendants’ request for attorney’s fees. On March 6,\n2015, EP filed a motion for attorney’s fees, costs and\npostjudgment interest pursuant to § 35-54. The court\nheld a hearing on that motion on March 16, 2015.\nAlthough the plaintiff did not file a written objection\nto EP’s motion prior to the hearing, its counsel\nexpressed at the hearing that it objected to the motion\nand that it assumed that the hearing would be eviden-\ntiary. Counsel for the plaintiff also requested permission\nto file a memorandum in opposition to EP’s motion\nafter the hearing. The court stated: ‘‘Well, to the extent\nthat either side wants to put on evidence, I’m certainly\ngoing to permit that.’’ The court also indicated that it\nwould permit the plaintiff to file a memorandum follow-\ning the hearing. The court then asked counsel for EP\nto proceed on his motion. Counsel for EP indicated to\nthe court that it was relying as evidence for its claim\nfor attorney’s fees the affidavits that he had attached\nto his March 6, 2015 motion. Those affidavits were\nmarked by the court as defendants’ exhibit A. By way\nof objection to the amount of attorney’s fees requested\nby EP, the plaintiff argued that certain of the time billed\nby counsel for EP should be segregated out of their bill\nbecause it did not concern the claims that the trial court\nhad determined were maintained in bad faith. Upon\ninquiry by the court, the plaintiff agreed that the court\nshould look at the billing records from February, 2013,\nup ‘‘to the time of trial and make a reduction because\nthe product technology was off the table during that\n\ftime period . . . .’’ Following its argument that certain\nbilling should be excised by way of timing, the court\nasked, ‘‘Anything further by way of . . . putting me on\nnotice of what you anticipate challenging from a factual\nstandpoint, or a legal argument you’d like to present?’’\nThe plaintiff responded only that it did not believe that\nEP’s claim for costs were appropriate under the law,\nand stated that it would brief that argument fully. The\ncourt advised counsel that once it received all of the\nparties’ posthearing filings, it would assess ‘‘whether\n[it could] take it on the papers or whether [it would]\nneed to bring everybody back in.’’ Counsel for the defen-\ndant thanked the court and the court set a briefing\nschedule, after which it stated, consistent with its ear-\nlier statement: ‘‘And I will review everything that is\nsubmitted, and I will decide at that point whether I can\nresolve the question of award on papers, or whether I\nneed to bring you back. If, having reviewed each other’s\nsubmissions, you think one way or the other, then you\nshould communicate to [the court officer] whether the\ncourt can take it on the papers or you feel strongly that\nyou want to come back. As I said, I’ll have your input\non that, and ultimately I will decide whether I take it\non the papers.’’\n   On April 7, 2015, the plaintiff filed an objection to\nEP’s motion for attorney’s fees, costs and interest, in\nwhich it stated: ‘‘The issue for the court’s determination\nnow is the reasonableness of [EP]’s request for attor-\nney’s fees for the plaintiff’s maintenance of claims of\nmisappropriation of the plaintiff’s product technology\nand box design after 2011.’’ The plaintiff argued, inter\nalia, that EP’s claimed amount of attorney’s fees failed\nto properly apportion the amount of time spent on the\nclaims that the court found to have been pursued in\nbad faith, versus its colorable claims, and posited that\nthe appropriate award of attorney’s fees, after proper\napportionment, would be $60,998.70. The plaintiff also\nobjected to EP’s counsel billing their full hourly rate\nfor time spent traveling as unreasonable.11\n   In response to the plaintiff’s objection, EP argued\nthat the plaintiff’s calculation of attorney’s fees was\nbased upon the incorrect premise that if a billable item\ninvolves both a colorable claim and a bad faith claim,\nthen it cannot be recovered. EP argued to the con-\ntrary—that the plaintiff’s colorable claims and bad faith\nclaims were so intertwined that they could not be sepa-\nrated. The plaintiff filed a surreply to EP’s response,\nand EP filed a reply to the plaintiff’s surreply, wherein\nboth parties reiterated their respective positions on the\napportionment of fees between colorable claims and\nthose made in bad faith. Nowhere in any of those post-\nhearing filings did either party request an evidentiary\nhearing before the court.12\n   On May 21, 2015, the court issued an order in which\nit concluded that ‘‘it would be impossible, due to the\n\fintertwined nature of the CUTSA claims with the tort\nclaims, as well as the intertwined nature of both the\ncolorable and noncolorable CUTSA claims, to attempt\nto segregate out specific invoice entries or apportion\nonly some of the fees to the CUTSA claim brought in\nbad faith.’’ The court thus awarded attorney’s fees in\nthe amount of $171,203.40, which was the amount\nrequested by EP, minus a 10 percent reduction to\naccount for the ‘‘defense of the other causes of action\nand/or the colorable CUTSA claims . . . .’’\n  On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the award of attor-\nney’s fees to the plaintiff on the grounds that EP failed to\nmeet its burden of distinguishing between the plaintiff’s\ncolorable claims and those maintained in bad faith and\napportioning the claimed fees accordingly, and that the\ncourt erred in accepting EP’s allegedly unfounded con-\ntention that its defense of the plaintiff’s colorable claims\nconstituted ‘‘approximately 10 percent of the case.’’\n   ‘‘We review the reasonableness of the court’s award\nof attorney’s fees under the abuse of discretion stan-\ndard. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard of\nreview, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption\nin favor of upholding the trial court’s ruling, and only\nupset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus,\nour] review of [the amount of attorney’s fees awarded]\nis limited to the questions of whether the trial court\ncorrectly applied the law and reasonably could have\nreached the conclusion it did. . . . A court has few\nduties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing\ncounsel fees. The issue grows even more delicate on\nappeal . . . for the trial court is in the best position\nto evaluate the circumstances of each case.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) East Windsor v. East Wind-\nsor Housing, Ltd., LLC, 150 Conn. App. 268, 275, 92\nA.3d 955 (2014).\n   In issuing its award of attorney’s fees to EP, the\ncourt relied upon our Supreme Court’s decision in Total\nRecycling Services of Connecticut, Inc. v. Connecticut\nOil Recycling Services, LLC, 308 Conn. 312, 63 A.3d\n896 (2013), in which the court held: ‘‘[W]hen certain\nclaims provide for a party’s recovery of contractual\nattorney’s fees but others do not, a party is nevertheless\nentitled to a full recovery of reasonable attorney’s fees\nif an apportionment is impracticable because the claims\narise from a common factual nucleus and are inter-\ntwined.’’ Id., 333. In light of the trial court’s determina-\ntion that the plaintiff’s claims were intertwined to the\npoint that it would be impossible to separate them,\nwe disagree, as did the trial court, with the plaintiff’s\ncontention that EP failed to meet its burden of distin-\nguishing between the plaintiff’s colorable claims and\nthose maintained in bad faith. The court was free to\naccept or reject EP’s contention that its defense of\nthe plaintiff’s colorable claims accounted for only 10\npercent of the claimed fees and properly exercised its\n\fdiscretion in fashioning its award of attorney’s fees\nto EP.\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  1\n     As a preliminary matter, the trial court explained: ‘‘The court does not\nattempt to include in this decision all of the evidence relied upon in the\ncourt’s factual findings. The court has considered all of the evidence admit-\nted, and the reference to any subset of the evidence presented should not\nbe construed as identifying the exclusive basis for the court’s ruling. Neither\nshould the court’s failure to identify or mention specific evidence give rise\nto an inference that such evidence has not been considered.’’\n   2\n     The trial court noted: ‘‘Given [the plaintiff]’s access to this information,\nand the additional evidence offered by the defendants as to EP’s relative\ncapabilities and products through the years, Akerman’s testimony that he\nbelieved that EP could not perform customizations, and that EP did not\nhave board games in its inventory is not credible.’’\n   3\n     The court explained: ‘‘[The plaintiff] also asserts that EP misappropriated\nits pricing strategies and information. [The plaintiff] adduced little if any\nevidence from which such a finding might be made. The court does not\nherein further address this claim. [The plaintiff] claims EP and Bergmann\nmisappropriated client lists. [The plaintiff] offers no evidence of such a\nclaim, with the possible exception of RBC, which was, at best, a potential\nfuture client. Bergmann testified he did not take any lists, and Wells testified\nthat Bergmann did not provide any lists. This testimony was credited. The\ncourt does not herein further address this claim. [The plaintiff] also asserts\nthat EP and Bergmann misappropriated, used and disseminated [the plain-\ntiff’s] ‘confidential information.’ Aside from the claims addressed above,\n[the plaintiff] offers no evidence from which such a finding could be made.\nThe court does not herein further address this claim. Indeed, [the plaintiff]\ncontinues to make broad, sweeping allegations of wrongdoing by EP even\nthough the evidence at trial as to such sweeping allegations was utterly\nlacking.’’\n   4\n     The court further noted: ‘‘The plaintiff’s case relies largely on the testi-\nmony of Jonas Akerman, who presented on many issues, as not credible.\nThe court observed Mr. Akerman’s unwillingness to let go of beliefs or\nsuspicions which were concededly based upon false premises. He offered\ntestimony on ‘facts’ only to have those same ‘facts’ to be revealed as his\npersonal opinion, for which no corroborating evidence was offered. He was\nunreasonably intransigent when confronted with contrary evidence. His\ntestimony was often refuted by other witnesses as well as the documentary\nevidence submitted. He was evasive and defensive. At times, his testimony\nwas simply inexplicable.’’\n   5\n     The court denied EP’s claim for costs on the ground that § 35-54 does\nnot provide for such an award. The court also awarded postjudgment interest\nat the rate of 5 percent per annum. Neither of those orders is challenged\non appeal.\n   6\n     The plaintiff also sought clarification as to an order requiring the defen-\ndants to disclose their expert. That portion of the court’s order is not relevant\nto the claims on appeal.\n   7\n     The plaintiff also argues for the first time in its reply brief to this court\nthat the trial court applied the incorrect legal standard to its bad faith\ndetermination. It is well settled that this court does not address claims\nraised for the first time in a reply brief.\n   8\n     The trial court noted: ‘‘At trial, [the plaintiff] produced, for the first time,\na page from a multipage document which was prepared by [the plaintiff]’s\nfinancial advisors during the 2008 due diligence. It is a one page summary\nwhich encapsulates the advisor’s assessment of EP and the viability of an\nacquisition. The one page summary does not include any mention of EP’s\ncapacity to customize its product to suit the needs of its clients. Akerman\ntestified that this is a document on which he relied in coming to his belief\nthat EP had lost its previous ability to customize until after Bergmann was\nhired. However, the document itself was part of a bigger document which\nincluded a second page containing a fair amount of information on EP’s\ncustomization capacity. [The] plaintiff’s effort to bolster what the court has\nfound to be false testimony with an incomplete and misleading document\nis troubling. While this court does not go so far as to conclude that Akerman\nsought to mislead the court by withholding the second page, it does appear\nto this court that he was trying to bolster his own false statement that he\n\fdid not believe EP had a high level of customization capability.’’\n   9\n     ‘‘The plaintiff also sought: a list of current and former clients; a descrip-\ntion of which products were sold to which clients; and other clearly protected\ntrade secret information.’’\n   10\n      The plaintiff also claims on appeal that the trial court improperly deter-\nmined that it had made a claim of misappropriation of the ‘‘Conductor’’ box\nitself. The plaintiff argues that its claim concerning the box concerned only\nthe identity of the designer of the box. A reading of the plaintiff’s brief to\nthis court, in which it cites its own posttrial brief to the trial court belies\nthis argument. As the plaintiff stated in its brief to this court: ‘‘In its posttrial\nmemorandum, the plaintiff argued that ‘the unique design of [its] Conductor\nbox, including who makes it and how,’ were trade secrets as defined\nunder CUTSA.’’\n   11\n      The plaintiff also challenged EP’s request for costs and postjudgment\ninterest. The court did not award costs and although it did award postjudg-\nment interest, the plaintiff has not challenged that award on appeal.\n   12\n      The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in denying its request\nfor an evidentiary hearing. Our review of the record reveals that this is a\nmisrepresentation of the proceedings that occurred before the trial court.\nAlthough counsel for the plaintiff suggested a desire to cross-examine coun-\nsel for EP as to the reasonableness of the claimed fees, he was unable,\nupon inquiry by the court, to articulate a basis for such an examination,\nand, instead, challenged the apportionment of the billing between the color-\nable and the bad faith claims. Counsel for the plaintiff indicated to the court\nthat he would fully address that argument in his posthearing brief. The court\nindicated to counsel for both parties that if either of them wanted to come\nback for an evidentiary hearing following the posthearing briefing, to so\nindicate to the court or the court would consider the issue on the papers.\nNeither party made such a request. The quoted portions of the hearing that\nare cited herein, in addition to the fact that neither party requested an\nevidentiary hearing in their posthearing briefs, belie the plaintiff’s claim that\nthe trial court denied its request for such an opportunity.\n\f",

The plaintiff, BTS, USA, Inc., appeals\nfrom the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor\nof the defendants, Executive Perspectives, LLC (EP),\nand Marshall Bergmann, on its claims against them for\nviolation of the Connecticut Uniform Trade Secrets Act\n(CUTSA); General Statutes § 35-50 et seq.; and the Con-\nnecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act; General Statutes\n§ 42-110a et seq.; and tortious interference with the\nplaintiff’s business relationships, and on its claim\nagainst Bergmann for breach of his employment con-\ntract with the plaintiff and against EP for tortious inter-\nference with that employment contract. On appeal, the\nplaintiff claims that the court abused its discretion by\n(1) precluding it from inspecting an adequate sampling\nof EP’s products; (2) determining that the name and\nidentity of the plaintiff’s vendor was not a trade secret;\n(3) denying its request for injunctive relief; (4) finding\nthat it had maintained its CUTSA claims in bad faith;\nand (5) awarding attorney’s fees to EP without distin-\nguishing the fees associated with its colorable claims\nfrom the claims found to have been made in bad faith.\nWe affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court,1 are\nrelevant to this appeal. ‘‘[The plaintiff] is part of a Swed-\nish based international corporation which designs and\nmarkets training simulations, experiential educational\nexercises and related products to business and industry.\nThe products include business simulations designed\nto educate and train client employees, whether upper\nmanagement, middle management or front office work-\ners. There are essentially three types of product[s]:\nlearning maps, computer simulations, and board games.\nThe products can be sold ‘as is’ or they can be custo-\nmized to varying degrees. As needed, a simulation can\nbe designed almost from scratch to suit the specific\nmodel or needs of the client. The president of [the\nplaintiff] is Jonas Akerman.\n   ‘‘EP is a direct competitor of [the plaintiff]. EP designs\nand sells the same types of product to the same types\nof clients, with the exception of learning maps. EP\ndoes not have any learning map type products in its\ninventory. It does however have both computer simula-\ntions and board game products. EP can also sell product\n‘as is’ or can customize the product to whatever extent\nis necessary to meet the needs of the client. Although\na direct competitor of [the plaintiff], EP is much smaller\nthan [the plaintiff]. The president of EP is John Wells.\n  ‘‘EP has been in business since 1983. EP has changed\nnames and has changed hands a few times over the\nyears but in 2004, John Wells and John Thomas (both\ncofounders of the company in 1983) reacquired the\nbusiness and all of its assets. The court credits the\ntestimony of Wells that throughout its existence, EP’s\n\fsimulation technology has gone largely unchanged and\nrelies in large measure on the original technology\nacquired in 1983. Although it has expanded with time,\nthe inventory of products has been unchanged, for the\nmost part, since approximately 2009. EP has always\nhad the ability and the manpower to customize its simu-\nlations. EP has had board game simulations in its inven-\ntory for many years. EP has not created any new\nproducts or simulations since approximately 2009.\n   ‘‘The court further finds, crediting the testimony of\nWells and the documentary evidence offered by the\ndefendants, that as of the filing of this lawsuit, most of\nthis information was known to [the plaintiff]. In 2008,\n[the plaintiff] considered acquiring EP. As a result, sub-\nject to a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement,\n[the plaintiff]’s financial advisors and [the plaintiff]\nwere given access to much of EP’s proprietary informa-\ntion. EP disclosed details of its corporate structure;\npersonnel; sales history; client information; capabilities;\nliabilities and other information pertinent to a determi-\nnation as to whether it was a good prospect for acquisi-\ntion. During this time, Wells and Akerman had\ndiscussions about EP’s capabilities to include the scope\nand range of its customization ability. Ultimately, [the\nplaintiff] determined not to proceed.2\n   ‘‘Marshall Bergmann was employed by [the plaintiff]\nfrom 2005 until mid-June, 2010. He was a senior director\nat the time he left. As such, he had access to much of [the\nplaintiff]’s proprietary information and was involved in\nmany of the proprietary processes, i.e., product pricing\n. . . [of the plaintiff]. When Bergmann began work\n. . . [for the plaintiff], he signed an employment con-\ntract which contained a number of restrictions, to\ninclude a noncompete clause upon his departure. Mate-\nrial to the plaintiff’s claim that the contract was\nbreached by Bergmann and/or interfered with by EP\nare the following provisions:\n   ‘‘ ‘2.1 Employee shall not for a period of two (2) years\nimmediately following the end of the Employee’s active\nduties with Employer, either directly or indirectly,\neither for himself or for any other person, company or\nother business entity:\n  ‘‘ ‘a. Make known or otherwise make available to\nany person, company, and/or other business entity the\nnames and addresses of any clients (whether the corpo-\nrate entity or the individuals employed by such corpo-\nrate entity) of Employer or any other information\npertaining to them;\n  ‘‘ ‘b. Call on, solicit, or take away, or attempt to call\non, solicit, or take away or communicate in any manner\nwhatsoever, with any of the clients of Employer;\n  ‘‘ ‘c. Call on, solicit, or take away, or attempt to call\non, solicit, or take away or communicate in any manner\nwhatsoever, with any of the clients of Employer on\n\fbehalf of any business which directly competes with\nemployer.\n  ‘‘ ‘2.2 For the purposes of this Agreement, clients shall\nbe defined as any person, company or other business\nentity whom the Employer has performed work or ser-\nvices for, solicited business and/or collected monies\nfrom, with the twelve month period immediately pre-\nceding the end of the Employee’s active duties with\nthe Employer.’\n  ‘‘While [working for the plaintiff], Bergmann was\ninvolved in an effort to do business with the Royal Bank\nof Canada (RBC). Ultimately, RBC decided not to do\nbusiness with [the plaintiff] and decided to give the\nbusiness to a Canadian business school. RBC turned\ndown [the plaintiff]’s offer in June, 2010. Prior to 2010,\nRBC was not a client of [the plaintiff]. [The plaintiff]\nhad not previously done any business with RBC.\n   ‘‘Also in June, 2010, Bergmann accepted a job offer\nfrom EP to work in its New York office. He gave two\nweeks’ notice to [the plaintiff]. He did not tell [the\nplaintiff] that he was going to work for a competitor.\nBergmann testified that he did not take any contact\nlists, client lists, vendor lists or other . . . . informa-\ntion with him when he left. This testimony is credited.\nFurther, Wells testified that Bergmann did not share\n[the plaintiff’s] client lists, client information, technol-\nogy, product information, pricing strategies or other\nproprietary information. Nor did EP solicit any such\ninformation from Bergmann upon his arrival or at any\ntime thereafter. This court finds Wells’ testimony\ncredible.\n   ‘‘Shortly after he began work at EP, Bergmann posted\nhis new job to his LinkedIn account. Those to whom\nhe was ‘linked’ on this social media could have received\na notification of this posting. Whether a ‘linked’ individ-\nual received notice of the posting or not would depend\non the particular settings selected by that person. One\nof the tasks given Bergmann when he joined EP was\nto improve and revamp the EP website, which he did.\nUpon completion he posted an invitation to ‘check out’\nthe new website via his LinkedIn account. Some of the\nindividuals to whom Bergmann was ‘linked’ were clients\nand contacts he had developed while [working for the\nplaintiff]. He did not ‘unlink’ these people when he left\n[the plaintiff’s employ]. He was not asked to do so. He\nnever had any discussions with anyone at BTS about\nhis LinkedIn account. In fact, many people [employed\nby the plaintiff] have similar LinkedIn accounts and are\nstill linked to Bergmann.\n  ‘‘Shortly after he began work at EP, Bergmann con-\ntacted Liz Carreiro and Jan Wilmott, both of whom\nworked at RBC. Carreiro and Wilmott were the contacts\nat RBC Bergmann dealt with when trying to sell the\n[plaintiff’s] product/project shortly before his departure\n\ffrom [its employ]. He had known Jan Wilmott for years,\nto include a time when Wilmott did not work at RBC.\nIn his correspondence, Bergmann advised RBC that he\nhad taken a new job with EP and he attempted to meet\nwith and discuss EP’s capabilities for possible business\nin the future. The correspondence was clearly designed\nto get business with RBC for EP, something readily\nacknowledged by Bergmann in his testimony. The cor-\nrespondence also included some comparisons between\nEP and [the plaintiff], which were unfavorable to [the\nplaintiff] as well as some arguably disparaging com-\nments about [the plaintiff]. The communications did\nnot contain any proprietary information belonging to\n[the plaintff] and did not make reference to any such\ninformation. Ultimately, RBC did not do any business\nwith EP. In fact, to date, RBC has done no business\nwith EP. Bergmann’s last correspondence or contact\nwith RBC occurred in November, 2010.\n  ‘‘Conversely, after Bergmann left [the plaintiff’s\nemploy], Akerman maintained regular contact with\nRBC. [The plaintiff] continued in discussions with RBC\nand in 2013, sold RBC an education/training product.\nDuring that process, [the plaintiff] initially quoted a\nparticular price to RBC. RBC responded that the price\nwas too high. As a result, [the plaintiff] developed differ-\nent options by which RBC could obtain the same result\nor objective but which would be less costly. The product\nwas scaled back in some respects in order to achieve\nthese cost savings. Ultimately, RBC chose one of the\noptions developed by [the plaintiff]. This option was\n$73,000 less expensive than the originally quoted prod-\nuct proposal. [The plaintiff] provided the work/product\nto RBC and to this day enjoys a good business relation-\nship with RBC. . . .\n   ‘‘While at EP, within two years of his arrival, Berg-\nmann was assigned to work in the field at Hewlett\nPackard (HP). He did not solicit HP and did not have\nany role in securing the business of HP. He was merely\nassigned to help deliver the product. HP was a client\nof [the plaintiff] as well, though Bergmann never did\nany work for HP while he was [employed by the plain-\ntiff]. HP remains a client of [the plaintiff], and there was\nno evidence that Bergmann’s work on the HP project\nincluded the use of any [of the plaintiff’s] proprietary\nor confidential information. Nor was there evidence\noffered that Bergmann’s work on the HP project had\nany adverse impact on [the plaintiff] or its relationship\nwith HP.\n   ‘‘Richard Kelly is one of EP’s independent contractors\nin Australia. He is also a former employee of BTS, Aus-\ntralia, Inc. Kelly left BTS Australia in February, 2009.\nAfter he left BTS Australia, he went to work for a firm\ncalled AJ Lucas. While at AJ Lucas, he had discussions\nwith BTS Australia about BTS Australia providing a\nproduct/training exercise to AJ Lucas. In connection\n\fwith those discussions, BTS Australia gave Kelly a ‘par-\nticipant kit’ for one of its learning map products called\n‘Conductor.’ The kit was contained within a cardboard\nbox, which was designed to look like a large envelope.\nIt also bore artwork specific to the Conductor game.\nKelly, individually or on behalf of AJ Lucas, was not\nasked to enter into a confidentiality agreement with\nrespect to the participant kit. He was not advised that\neither the box or its contents were proprietary or that\nthey were not to be shared with anyone else. Although\nAJ Lucas ultimately determined not to do business with\nBTS Australia, no one at BTS Australia asked Kelly to\nreturn the participants kit or the box in which it was\nhoused. In sum, the box and the kit were given away\nby BTS [Australia] to AJ Lucas as a potential client\nwithout any restrictions. When Kelly left his employ-\nment with AJ Lucas, he took the box and the participant\nkit home.\n   ‘‘In 2010, Kelly contacted EP about possible employ-\nment opportunities. He was hired as an independent\ncontractor for marketing and sales of EP’s inventory\nof products in Australia. Also in 2010, EP was thinking\nabout changing its packaging for one of its board game\nproducts, ‘Takeoff,’ and perhaps ‘Wild Fire,’ as well.\nDuring a discussion on this issue, Kelly advised EP that\nthe box used by [the plaintiff] might be of interest.\nThereafter, he took a photograph of the outside of the\n‘Conductor’ box he had received when he was at AJ\nLucas and sent the photographs to EP. EP then did a\nmock-up of its own art work for a similar style box.\nBergmann advised EP that Ironwood Lithographers was\nthe vendor that [the plaintiff] used for its packaging.\nHe gave Kelly Snider, at EP, the name of Jay Topczewski\nas a point of contact at Ironwood and told her to men-\ntion his name as the reference. [The plaintiff’s] employ-\nees, to include Bergmann, were never told that vendor\nnames are proprietary and not to be shared. Bergmann’s\nemployment contract, which contained a lengthy\ndescription of information deemed ‘confidential,’ did\nnot include the names of vendors as subject to its non-\ndisclosure provisions.\n  ‘‘Snider contacted Topczewski by e-mail to inquire\nabout a quote for packaging. She sent the EP mock-up\nas well as the photographs of the ‘Conductor’ partici-\npant kit box. Topczewski did not believe that he could\nor should be using the [the plaintiff’s] packaging as a\nbase design for EP. He declined to do business with EP\nand advised [the plaintiff] of his interactions with EP.\n   ‘‘All of the events which purport to comprise the\ntortious conduct complained of occurred in the latter\nsix months of 2010. And notwithstanding these events,\n[the plaintiff] continues to enjoy an excellent and ongo-\ning business relationship with Ironwood; RBC changed\nfrom being a prospective client of [the plaintiff] to an\nactual client; RBC and [the plaintiff] enjoy an ongoing\n\fbusiness relationship; RBC never gave any business to\nEP; EP has done no business with Ironwood; EP never\nchanged its ‘Take Off’ or ‘Wildfire’ packaging.’’3 (Foot-\nnotes altered.)\n   On the basis of these factual findings, the court con-\ncluded: ‘‘With these facts found, it is manifest that the\nplaintiff’s evidence is so lacking that the determination\nthat the plaintiff has failed in its burden of proof is\ncompletely unremarkable.’’4 (Footnote altered.) The\ncourt further found that the ‘‘[p]laintiff’s theory of dam-\nages is factually and legally unfounded.’’ The court thus\nrendered judgment in favor of the defendants on all\nfive counts of the plaintiff’s complaint. The court also\nfound that the plaintiff’s CUTSA claim, although ‘‘color-\nable at the outset, portions of it became objectively\nspecious shortly into the discovery process,’’ and thus\nthat the plaintiff’s insistence in maintaining certain of\nthose claims was motivated by improper purposes. Pur-\nsuant to General Statutes § 35-54, on the basis of that\ndetermination, the court awarded attorney’s fees to EP\nin the amount of $171,203.40.5 This appeal followed.\nAdditional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n                             I\n   The plaintiff first claims that the trial court abused\nits discretion in not permitting it to inspect an adequate\nnumber of EP’s products to ascertain whether EP had\nmisappropriated trade secrets. We disagree.\n  The following factual and procedural history is rele-\nvant to this claim. On May 7, 2012, the plaintiff served\nupon the defendants a request for inspection seeking\nto have its expert witness inspect six of EP’s products,\nnamely: ‘‘[The following] computer simulations of the\ndefendant [EP] with regard to the (a) user interface,\n(b) programming language and (c) the processing meth-\nodology (including a demonstration by an operator des-\nignated by [EP] for each: (1) ‘Go Figure—Financial\nServices’; (2) ‘Strategic Horizons’; (3) ‘Oil & Gas Per-\nspectives’; (4) ‘Business Perspectives.’ [In addition,\nthese] board simulations/learning maps of [EP]: (1)\n‘Wildfire’ [and] (2) ‘Take-off for Teams.’ ’’\n   On May 14, 2012, the defendants filed an objection\nto the plaintiff’s request to inspect in which they argued,\ninter alia, that: ‘‘Undeterred by the mountain of evidence\nwhich contradicts [the] plaintiff’s speculation, the plain-\ntiff now seeks to accomplish its major objective in this\n[litigation—to acquire] [EP]’s trade secrets. With no\nsolid evidence to rest upon, the plaintiff has filed a\nmotion to inspect [EP]’s important secret products and\ncapabilities. [The] plaintiff seeks access to the com-\nputer programming language that [EP] uses to operate\nits products, as well as [EP]’s processing methodology.\n[The] plaintiff seeks access to these essential trade\nsecrets, even though the evidence clearly shows that\nthe products [the] plaintiff wants to inspect all predated\n\fBergmann’s hire.’’ (Emphasis in original.) The defen-\ndants addressed each of the products that the plaintiff\nsought to inspect, giving reasons as to why the plaintiff’s\nrequest to inspect should be denied, and emphasized\nthat the plaintiff already had received discovery that\nsupported the defendants’ claims and concluded that:\n‘‘[T]his must be the point in this litigation where [EP]’s\nessential trade secrets are deemed worthy of protection\nfrom its competitor. This should be especially so where\nthe evidence which supposedly justifies the disclosure\nor inspection of such trade secrets is totally lacking.\nMere speculation and unsupported allegations should\nnever allow access to competitive trade secrets.’’\n   On May 18, 2012, the plaintiff filed a reply to the\ndefendants’ objection to its request to inspect EP’s prod-\nucts, arguing that the defendants’ objection was actually\na motion for protective order and thus that the defen-\ndants had the burden to ‘‘demonstrate that disclosure\nof allegedly confidential information will work a clearly\ndefined and very serious injury’’ to their business.\n(Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nThe plaintiff argued that the defendants had completely\nfailed to meet this burden and that the parties had\nalready established measures to protect their trade\nsecrets by agreeing to a general protective order.\n   On May 24, 2012, the court, Dubay, J., held a hearing\non the dispute surrounding the plaintiff’s request to\ninspect EP’s products at which counsel for the parties\npresented oral argument. The court ordered, inter alia,\nthe parties to submit proposed orders regarding their\nrespective positions on the parameters of any inspec-\ntion to be conducted of EP’s products, including the\nscope of the inspection and the identity of an expert\nto conduct said inspection. After receiving the parties’\nproposals, the court issued an order on June 19, 2012,\nthat the plaintiff and EP each name an expert and that\nthose two experts confer to agree upon a neutral expert\nto conduct the inspection. The court ordered that if the\nparties could not come to an agreement in that regard,\nthat the parties would submit names of proposed\nexperts to the court and that it would appoint a neutral\nexpert to conduct the inspection; that said expert would\nabide by the protective order previously agreed to by\nthe parties. As to the scope of the inspection, the court\nordered: ‘‘The defendants are to provide the neutral\nexpert with all documentary, electronic and physical\ninformation, and/or access to said information or indi-\nviduals with that information, for the purpose of con-\nducting an inspection of up to twenty percent (20%) of\nthe product offerings of [EP] listed in plaintiff’s motion\nto inspect dated May 14, 2012. The choice as to which\nproducts to be inspected shall be within the sound\ndiscretion of the neutral expert.’’ The court further\nordered: ‘‘Upon the conclusion of the inspection, the\nneutral expert shall prepare and issue an interim report\ndesignated ‘Attorney’s Eyes Only’ directed to counsel\n\ffor the parties. The report shall state in sufficient detail,\nbut without disclosing proprietary information belong-\ning to [EP] or [the plaintiff] the neutral expert’s findings\nwith regard to the neutral expert’s review of each of\nthe products, whether there is a significant similarity\nbetween the products of [EP] and [the plaintiff] and, if\nthere is a similarity, whether the similarity is significant\nenough to give rise to an inference of misappropriation\nof [the plaintiff]’s products by [EP], or whether addi-\ntional inquiry by the neutral expert is warranted in order\nto make such determination.’’\n   The plaintiff thereafter sought clarification of the\ncourt’s June 19, 2012 order, specifically as to the number\nof EP’s products the court was permitting the neutral\nexpert to inspect.6 The court held a hearing on the\nplaintiff’s motion for clarification on July 6, 2012. Pri-\nmarily, the plaintiff sought clarification as to whether\nthe court intended the inspection to encompass 20 per-\ncent of EP’s entire product line, which equated to\napproximately six products, or 20 percent of the six\nproducts that the plaintiff listed in its request to inspect.\nAt the hearing, the court clarified that its order was\nthat the plaintiff could inspect 20 percent of the prod-\nucts that it had listed in its request, not 20 percent\nof EP’s entire product line. Upon hearing the court’s\nclarification, the plaintiff made an oral motion for\nreconsideration of the scope of the inspection to include\nmore than 20 percent of the six products it had listed\nin its request for inspection as that figure would equate\nto only one product. The court explained to counsel\nfor the plaintiff: ‘‘I know that you believe that the scope\nof the audit is insufficient and it may not serve your\npurpose for . . . it certainly doesn’t give you what you\nsought. However, in this case, I was very close to finding\nthat an insufficient showing had been made to allow\nany discovery whatsoever, which was the position that\nwas urged upon me by [counsel for the defendants];\nthat essentially the plaintiff had not made any showing\nin this case which should allow a raid of [20] percent\nof the work product of the defendant. And so . . . I\ndecided that 20 percent of 20 percent, or 4 percent is\nbetter than zero percent.’’ The court permitted the par-\nties to file posthearing memoranda on the plaintiff’s\nmotion to reconsider. On July 19, 2012, the court reaf-\nfirmed its June 19, 2012 order.\n  The parties thereafter reached an impasse in choos-\ning a neutral expert to conduct the inspection, and the\ncourt thus issued an order on August 28, 2012, naming\nsaid expert, Francois Thrower. Thrower conducted his\ninspection and on January 2, 2013, issued his report,\nwherein he explained: ‘‘It is now abundantly clear to\nme that a broader review of EP products is necessary\nto assess the likelihood that the products of EP are\ncopies or derivative works of [the plaintiff’s] products.’’\nThrower opined that the inspection of the court-permit-\nted singular product ‘‘is simply too few products to\n\fdetermine if there are sufficient similarities in products\nand whether technology and know-how have been mis-\nappropriated.’’ Thrower noted that he reviewed two\nversions of EP’s ‘‘Wildfire’’ product. He did not, how-\never, set forth any findings regarding that inspection.\nRather, Thrower explained that a review of ‘‘both com-\nputer and noncomputer-based products including\ngeneric and customized examples is required.’’ He thus\nrequested ‘‘as a starting point’’ to inspect all six of the\nproducts identified in the plaintiff’s May 14, 2012\nrequest for inspection.\n   On January 8, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for\norder seeking to inspect the products identified by\nThrower in his report. The defendants filed an objection\nto that motion, arguing, inter alia, that Thrower had\nnot, on the basis of his inspection of Wildfire, deter-\nmined that they had stolen the plaintiff’s trade secrets,\nbut, rather, Thrower was simply seeking to expand the\nscope of the inspection to obtain more information to\nmake that determination. Thrower did not opine as\nto Wildfire’s similarity, or lack thereof, to any of the\nplaintiff’s products. The court, Dooley, J., held a hearing\non the plaintiff’s motion and the defendant’s objection\non February 13, 2013, at which the plaintiff presented\nthe testimony of Thrower. Thrower testified that, upon\nbeing appointed to conduct the inspection in this case,\nhe first met with the plaintiff to familiarize himself with\ntheir products. Following that meeting, but before meet-\ning with EP to review its product, he sent an e-mail to\nthe parties stating that ‘‘it was not possible for me to\nrender a complete judgment without having a broader\naccess to both sides’ products.’’ He testified that he was\naware that the court had issued an order allowing the\ninspection of only one of EP’s products, which he was\npermitted to choose, but that he had reviewed seven-\nteen of the plaintiff’s products and wanted to ‘‘make a\nsimilar kind of comparison with EP’s products.’’\nThrower testified that he had chosen to inspect Wildfire\nbecause he had learned from the depositions of Wells\nand Bergmann that the packaging of Wildfire had been\na source of contention between the parties. On the basis\nof his inspection, Thrower testified that he could say\nwith a reasonable degree of certainty that there were no\nsimilarities between Wildfire and any of the plaintiff’s\nproducts. Despite that conclusion, however, Thrower\ntestified that he did not have enough information to\nconclude that none of EP’s products are, as the plain-\ntiff’s counsel stated, ‘‘remarkably similar’’ to any of [the\nplaintiff’s] products. On that basis, the plaintiff asked\nthe court to expand the scope of the inspection to\npermit Thrower to inspect more of EP’s products.\n  On February 15, 2013, the court denied the defen-\ndant’s motion for order seeking to inspect additional\nEP products. The court explained: ‘‘It appears to this\ncourt that granting the plaintiff’s motion for order so\nas to allow the further inspection by Mr. Thrower of\n\f[EP]’s products would necessarily require this court to\nrevisit and undo the prior determination of Judge\nDubay. The question[s] of whether, how and to what\nextent [EP]’s products would be inspected by a court-\nappointed expert were thoroughly and aggressively liti-\ngated before Judge Dubay. The outcome of that litiga-\ntion is contained in the court’s order dated June 19,\n2012, as clarified by order dated July 19, 2012. The\ncourt permitted a very limited inspection, which could\npotentially be expanded if the initial limited inspection,\nby virtue of its findings, gave rise to such an expansion.\nMr. Thrower determined that [EP]’s product chosen for\ninspection had absolutely no similarity to any of the\nplaintiff’s products. Thus, by virtue of the court’s prior\ndeterminations, no further inspection is warranted. This\ncourt gives ‘law of the case’ deference to these prior\norders. . . . The fact that Mr. Thrower determined not\nto follow the court’s directive and simply render an\nopinion as to the single product chosen, and chose\ninstead to request greater access so that he might make\na more informed judgment does not change the analysis.\nIt was for the court, following input from both parties,\nto determine the scope of the expert’s assignment and\nthe role he might play in the litigation. His desire to\nplay a different role or to expand the scope of his\nassignment is not reason, at this juncture, to revisit or\nchange Judge Dubay’s decision.’’\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court abused\nits discretion in permitting it to inspect only one of EP’s\nproducts because the defendants failed to show good\ncause to limit the plaintiff’s discovery request pursuant\nto Practice Book § 13-5. Our Supreme Court has stated,\n‘‘We have long recognized that the granting or denial\nof a discovery request rests in the sound discretion of\nthe [trial] court, and is subject to reversal only if such\nan order constitutes an abuse of that discretion. . . .\n[I]t is only in rare instances that the trial court’s decision\nwill be disturbed. . . . That ample discretion is limited,\nhowever, by the provisions of the rules [of practice]\npertaining to discovery; Practice Book §§ 217–221 [now\n§§ 13-2 through 13-5]; especially the mandatory provi-\nsion that discovery shall be permitted if the disclosure\nsought would be of assistance in the prosecution or\ndefense of the action. . . . The [party] opposing . . .\nretains the ability [however] to object to such requests\nby any number of procedural vehicles, including written\nobjection, motion to quash, motion to limit, or motion\nfor a protective order. See Practice Book § 13-5 . . . .\nThe court, in its discretion, may grant or deny such\nobjections as it deems appropriate.’’ (Citations omitted;\nemphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\nBrody v.

Although the plaintiff claims that the court\nabused its discretion in limiting the scope of its inspec-\ntion of EP’s products, it has not challenged as erroneous\nthe basis for the court’s limitation on that inspection,\nthe court’s determination that the plaintiff’s request for\ninspection was based upon speculative allegations of\nthe misappropriation of trade secrets. On the basis of\nthe defendants’ arguments that the plaintiff’s allegations\nwere based solely upon speculation, the court remarked\nthat it was very close to denying the request for inspec-\ntion altogether. On the basis of the court’s finding in\nthis regard, the court acted well within its discretion\nin limiting the scope of the inspection.\n   The plaintiff also claims that the court abused its\ndiscretion in deferring to Judge Dubay’s limitation of\nthe scope of the inspection as ‘‘the law of the case.’’\n‘‘The law of the case doctrine provides that [w]here a\nmatter has previously been ruled upon interlocutorily,\nthe court in a subsequent proceeding in the case may\ntreat that decision as the law of the case, if it is of the\nopinion that the issue was correctly decided, in the\nabsence of some new or overriding circumstance.’’\n(Internal quotation marks omitted.)

Here, it is\nclear from the court’s explanation of its denial of the\nplaintiff’s motion for order permitting the inspection of\nadditional EP products that the court found that Judge\nDubay had correctly decided the plaintiff’s earlier, heav-\nily litigated request to inspect EP’s products and the\nobjection filed by EP and that no new or overriding\ncircumstance had arisen that would form the basis for\nan expansion of that order. Thus, the plaintiff’s claim\nthat the court abused its discretion in this regard also\nmust fail.\n                             II\n  The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in\ndetermining that the name and identity of the plaintiff’s\nvendor was not a trade secret. We disagree.\n   ‘‘The question of whether information sought to be\nprotected by [CUTSA] rises to the level of a trade secret\nis one of fact for the trial court. . . .

Accordingly, to make out a prima facie case\nfor a violation of CUTSA, the plaintiff was required to\npresent sufficient evidence that, if believed, would\nprove that its ‘‘vendor information consisting of the\nunpublished name and e-mail address of the vendor\nrepresentative . . . Topczewski,’’ had independent\neconomic value and that the plaintiff made reasonable\nefforts to maintain the secrecy of his identity.\n   Here, the trial court found: ‘‘The plaintiff also failed\nto establish that the name of the vendor who makes\nthe packaging is a trade secret. [The plaintiff’s] employ-\nees, to include Bergmann, were never told that vendor\nnames are proprietary and not to be shared. Bergmann’s\nemployment contract, which contained a lengthy\ndescription of information deemed ‘confidential,’ did\nnot include the names of vendors as subject to its non-\ndisclosure provisions. The fact that Bergmann told\nSnider to use his name further supports the conclusion\nthat Bergmann was under no obligation to keep [the\nplaintiff’s] vendor names secret. Ironwood was identi-\nfied as a partner of [the plaintiff’s] predecessor in inter-\nest, The Real Learning Company, in that company’s\nwebsite. Ironwood has no contractual obligation or\nunderstanding with [the plaintiff] that it must keep its\nstatus as the [the plaintiff’s] box maker a secret. [The\nplaintiff] discloses Ironwood as its printer/vendor on\nthose occasions that Ironwood is required to speak\ndirectly to the client or on those occasions when Iron-\nwood ships the product directly to the client.\n  ‘‘In the face of this evidence, [the plaintiff] offers only\nthe testimony of Akerman that the box and vendors’\nnames are trade secrets. This is not sufficient.\n   ‘‘Furthermore, [the plaintiff] failed to establish that\neither the box or the vendor name was misappropriated\nor obtained through ‘improper means.’ BTS Australia\ngave the box to Kelly when Kelly worked for AJ Lucas.\n\fIt did so without restriction of any sort. It required no\nconfidentiality agreement; did not request its return and\nnever told Kelly the box (or even its content) were\nproprietary or not to be shared. Kelly, who was not\neven an employee of EP at the time, was under no\nobligation or duty to maintain the box’s secrecy. He\ntook it home, where it stayed. Months later, when Kelly\nworked for EP, he took a picture of the outside of the\nbox and sent it to EP. [The plaintiff] offers no evidence\nto contradict these facts. Nor does [the plaintiff] offer\na cogent explanation as to how EP’s possession of the\nphotograph of the outside of the box can be the result\nof ‘misappropriation‘ under these facts.\n   ‘‘Similarly, for the same reasons that the vendor iden-\ntities cannot be considered trade secrets, their use or\ndisclosure cannot constitute misappropriation. Berg-\nmann was not under any duty to maintain the secrecy\nof the vendor’s identities. The names were therefore\nnot obtained through improper means, and their use\nby EP was not misappropriation.’’\n    The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in focus-\ning on the identity of Ironwood, versus the ‘‘unpublished\npersonal contact information for Topczewski’’—that\n‘‘[t]he trial court erred when it failed to address the\nevidence as to the vendor contact information and\ninstead referenced evidence that the identity of Topc-\nzewski’s employer, Ironwood, was not confidential as\na basis for its determination that [the plaintiff]’s vendor\ninformation is not a trade secret.’’ The plaintiff argues,\n‘‘The vendor, Ironwood, does not publish Topczewski’s\nname or e-mail address; therefore, EP could have\nobtained his name and e-mail only through Bergmann.’’\n   The court’s determination that the names of the plain-\ntiff’s vendors did not constitute trade secrets logically\nencompasses the employees of those vendors. The fact\nthat EP discovered Topczewski’s identity and e-mail\naddress from Bergmann does not demonstrate that Ber-\ngmann was the only way that that information could\nhave been obtained, that that information had any inde-\npendent economic value, or that either the plaintiff or\nIronwood itself had taken measures to maintain the\nsecrecy of that information. On the basis of the record\nbefore us, we cannot conclude that the court erred in\ndetermining that the plaintiff’s ‘‘vendor contact informa-\ntion’’ was not a trade secret under CUTSA.\n                             III\n  The plaintiff also claims that the trial court improp-\nerly denied its request for injunctive relief under Gen-\neral Statutes § 35-52 (a). We disagree.\n  The trial court found: ‘‘Alternatively, the plaintiff\nseeks injunctive relief. CUTSA does allow for the grant-\ning of injunctive relief, in appropriate cases, in addition\nto or in lieu of damages . . . § 35-52 (a). However,\nnor has [the] plaintiff established that injunctive relief\n\fis appropriate.\n   ‘‘Bergmann left [the plaintiff’s employ] over four\nyears ago. The last act by Bergmann which is even\narguably a CUTSA violation occurred in November,\n2010. If, arguendo, the RBC solicitation was considered\na CUTSA violation, it was done without malice or\nimproper intent; it was isolated in nature; it caused no\nharm to [the plaintiff]; and it has not been repeated.\nThere is no evidence or indication that Bergmann or\nEP have done anything wrong since that time, and no\nindication that Bergmann or EP intend to use any of\n[the plaintiff]’s confidential information into the future.\n. . . Thus, absent any actual damages or cause for\ninjunctive relief, the CUTSA claim premised upon the\nRBC solicitation also fails.’’ (Citation omitted; internal\nquotation marks omitted.)\n   Our standard of review of a trial court’s denial of a\nrequest for injunctive relief is well settled. ‘‘The issu-\nance of an injunction and the scope and quantum of\ninjunctive relief rests in the sound discretion of the\ntrier. . . . A prayer for injunctive relief is addressed\nto the sound discretion of the court and the court’s\nruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determin-\ning whether the decision was based on an erroneous\nstatement of law or an abuse of discretion.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.)

An injunction shall be\nterminated when the trade secret has ceased to exist,\nbut the injunction may be continued for an additional\nreasonable period of time in order to eliminate commer-\ncial advantage that otherwise would be derived from\nthe misappropriation.’’\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly\ndenied its claim for injunctive relief on the basis of\nthree allegedly erroneous factual findings. First, the\nplaintiff argues that ‘‘the defendants have a continuing\nduty not to use the plaintiff’s existing trade secrets.’’\nSecond, the plaintiff claims that ‘‘a finding of malice or\nimproper intent is not required for injunctive relief.’’\nThird, the plaintiff contends that ‘‘a finding of threat-\nened misappropriation, not actual, is required for\ninjunctive relief.’’ We need not address the plaintiff’s\narguments in depth, as each of those grounds is easily\ndispatched by the trial court’s determination that the\nplaintiff had presented no evidence whatsoever of any\nwrongdoing by either of the defendants in the past,\nany intended wrongdoing in the future, or any harm\nstemming from any alleged wrongdoing. The plaintiff’s\nclaim that the trial court erred in denying its request\nfor injunctive relief is thus without merit.\n                            IV\n\f   The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred in\nfinding that it had maintained its CUTSA claims in bad\nfaith.7 We disagree.\n   In determining whether the plaintiff’s CUTSA claims\nwere maintained in bad faith, the trial court set forth\nthe following additional facts. ‘‘[The plaintiff] initially\nclaimed that Kelly misappropriated board game tech-\nnology and processes. This claim was made largely due\nto Akerman’s suspicions that Kelly had done so. Those\nsuspicions purportedly arose out of the coincidental\ntiming regarding Kelly’s departure from [BTS Australia]\nand EP’s addition of board games to its advertised\ninventory. Specifically, Akerman said EP began adver-\ntising board game product on its website in January,\n2009, the same time Kelly had left [BTS Australia] to\ngo to EP. Therefore, Akerman suspected and assumed\nthat Kelly misappropriated board game trade secret\ninformation and gave it to EP in January, 2009. How-\never, not long after this litigation began, that these prem-\nises were factually flawed came to light. First, EP has\nhad board game technology and advertised such (to\ninclude on its website) for many years prior to 2009.\nSecond, Kelly did not leave [BTS Australia] in January,\n2009. He left in February, 2009. Kelly did not go to EP\nfrom [BTS Australia] and had no contact with EP until\nJanuary, 2010. In the interim, he worked for AJ Lucas.\nFurther, the evidence established the [the plaintiff] was\nfully aware that Kelly did not leave until February, 2009,\nand that he did not pursue employment with EP at that\ntime. Indeed, after he left BTS Australia, he discussed\na potential business transaction between AJ Lucas and\nBTS Australia.\n   ‘‘An additional purported justification for pursuing\nthese claims was Akerman’s suspicion that Bergmann\nhad also shared product technology with EP. This suspi-\ncion turns out to be equally flawed and wholly incredi-\nble. Akerman claimed that EP did not have the capacity\nto provide ‘level 2’ customization to its simulation prod-\nucts until Bergmann began working at EP. Therefore, he\nreasoned, Bergmann must have shared that technology\nand processes with EP. However, as found above,\nthroughout its existence, EP has had the ability to cus-\ntomize product to whatever extent was necessary in\norder to meet a client’s needs. A review of the EP\nwebsite going back many years confirms this testimony.\nFurther, as already found above, [the plaintiff] was fully\naware of EP’s ability to perform ‘level 2’ customization\nof its simulations as a result of the information provided\nby Wells and EP during the 2008 due diligence. The\ninformation disclosed by EP during that due diligence\nincluded the extent to which EP’s work involved cus-\ntomization and the time value of its customization busi-\nness. Again, Akerman’s stated ‘suspicions’ as\njustification for this lawsuit were not well founded,\ncould have been debunked with a modicum of due\n\fdiligence and in fact, are not credible.8\n  ‘‘Akerman further testified that in 2010, when it was\nbrought to his attention that EP had contacted Iron-\nwood and appeared to have a ‘Conductor’ participant\nkit, he became further concerned or suspicious of EP.\nHowever, soon into the litigation, [the plaintiff] knew\nthat the box had been given to Kelly by [BTS Australia]\nwithout restriction, while he was at AJ Lucas. [The\nplaintiff] was provided chapter and verse as to the cir-\ncumstances under which the Conductor box and kit\ncame into Kelly’s possession. [The plaintiff] has never\ndeveloped any evidence that the kit itself was ever seen\nor used by EP. Indeed, EP still has no learning map\ntype of product in its inventory.\n   ‘‘Nothwithstanding [the plaintiff]’s actual knowledge\nof when Kelly left, the complete debunking of the\nassumptions about Kelly, and [the plaintiff]’s knowl-\nedge that EP could in fact customize its product before\n2010, [the plaintiff] continued to seek extraordinary\ndiscovery in this case to include all of EP’s product\ntechnology.9 The court (Dubay, J.), recognizing the\ndearth of evidence to support [the plaintiff]’s suspi-\ncions, ordered a very limited review, by a court-\nappointed expert, of a single EP product. The expert\nfound no evidence of any similarity between the EP\nproduct chosen by [the plaintiff] and any of [the plain-\ntiff]’s products. The court (Dooley, J.) thereafter deter-\nmined that no justification existed for a further\nintrusion by [the plaintiff] into EP’s products or prod-\nuct technology.\n   ‘‘On the first day of trial [the plaintiff] advised EP\nand the court that the CUTSA claim would be limited\nand would not include any claim that EP misappropri-\nated product technology. [The plaintiff] did not concede\nthat no evidence existed to support the claim, but\nrather, blamed the court’s ruling restricting access to\nEP’s products, as the reason that it was unable to prove\nits suspicions regarding EP. Notwithstanding [the plain-\ntiff]’s pronouncement on the first day of trial, EP has\noffered voluminous testimony and evidence that no\nsuch misappropriation occurred. It d[id] so not to dis-\nprove the plaintiff’s case, but to advance its own claim\nthat the CUTSA action was brought and maintained in\nbad faith.\n   ‘‘EP’s claim that the CUTSA count was advanced in\nbad faith relies largely on the utter dearth of evidence,\nas outlined above, to support the initial allegations of\nproduct technology misappropriation. [The plaintiff]\nresponds that the lawsuit was only commenced after\na series of events which gave rise to grave concern\nregarding Bergmann and EP, to wit: Bergmann did not\ntell [the plaintiff] he was going to a competitor; [the\nplaintiff] learned that Bergmann was at EP; Bergmann\ncontacted RBC within weeks of joining EP (conduct\nwhich [the plaintiff] believed violated the employment\n\fagreement); Ironwood was contacted by EP and [the\nplaintiff] learned that EP had what appeared to be a\nparticipant kit for one of its learning map products; EP\nrequested a similar packaging design to the one used\nby [the plaintiff] for Conductor. Under these circum-\nstances, [the plaintiff] argues it had legitimate reason\nto believe Bergmann was sharing [the plaintiff’s] propri-\netary information and trade secrets.\n   ‘‘This court agrees that at its inception, the plaintiff\nhad a colorable CUTSA claim. [The plaintiff] had\nreceived sufficient information to give rise to an infer-\nence that EP was in possession of [the plaintiff’s] trade\nsecrets and pursuing the how and the extent of the\nsituation through this litigation was not bad faith on\nthe part of [the plaintiff]. However, not far into the\ndiscovery process, it was abundantly clear that the\nproduct technology claim had no merit. All of [the plain-\ntiff]’s suspicions or concerns regarding product technol-\nogy misappropriation should have been adequately laid\nto rest by the end of 2011. By then, it was abundantly\nclear that EP had not modified nor added to its technol-\nogy or product inventory since approximately 2009,\nlong before Kelly and Bergmann joined EP. This was\nmade clear to [the plaintiff] through discovery requests;\ndeposition testimony; and responses to document\nrequests.\n   ‘‘Further, Akerman’s factual assumptions and suspi-\ncions regarding Kelly were fully debunked by then. Kelly\nwas not hired by EP until 2010, and EP had board games\nlong before Kelly was hired. To the extent that the\nparticipant kit for ‘Conductor’ raised concerns, it was\nalso clear that EP does not have and has never had a\nlearning map type of product. Conductor is a learning\nmap product. For [the plaintiff] to maintain these claims\nafter the discovery process made crystal clear that the\nvery premises upon which his suspicions were purport-\nedly based were factually inaccurate gives rise to an\ninference that the litigation was maintained for\nimproper purposes. Indeed, to date, aside from factually\nflawed premises and the unfounded suspicions of Aker-\nman, [the plaintiff] has offered no explanation for per-\nsisting in its claim of product technology\nmisappropriation.\n   ‘‘In sum, no later than end of 2011, there was simply\nnothing left to justify or explain [the plaintiff]’s persis-\ntence in pursuing the CUTSA claims as to product tech-\nnology. [The plaintiff]’s quest to obtain EP product\ntechnology through discovery and court process, after\ntheir claims were laid bare as meritless, gives rise to\nan inference of improper motive on the part of [the\nplaintiff]. The court finds that [the plaintiff]’s determina-\ntion to maintain the product technology CUTSA claims\nas of the end of calendar year 2011 and through to the\nfirst day of trial was made in bad faith as that term has\nbeen defined by our appellate courts. The court will\n\fhear evidence as to the attorneys fees incurred\ndefending these claims during that time period.\n   ‘‘The claim that the Conductor box was a trade secret\nand was misappropriated was, as found, wholly without\nmerit. Akerman’s testimony, if believed, might have\nestablished that the packaging was considered a trade\nsecret, thus making this claim ‘colorable’ at the incep-\ntion of the litigation. However, in light of the circum-\nstances under which the box and its content came into\nKelly’s possession, i.e., it was given to him by [the plain-\ntiff] without restriction while he was employed at AJ\nLucas, the claim of ‘misappropriation’ as defined by\nCUTSA was demonstrably false and no longer ‘color-\nable’ upon those circumstances coming to light. Main-\ntaining such a claim, under those circumstances,\namounts to bad faith. Those circumstances were known\nto [the plaintiff] (if not before commencement of the\nlitigation) certainly by the end of 2011. The court will\nhear evidence as to the claimed attorney’s fees incurred\ndefending this claim after that date and through trial.\n  ‘‘The claim that the vendor names and contact infor-\nmation, specifically, Ironwood, was a trade secret was\nsupported by scant evidence. However, Akerman did\ntestify that the information is presently not available\nto the public and that [the plaintiff] does not advertise\nor share openly its vendor’s identities. While the court\nfound the evidence lacking in terms of the plaintiff’s\nburden, it was not a claim ‘without color.’\n   ‘‘The claim that the RBC solicitation involved the\nmisappropriation of a trade secret was also, throughout\nthe litigation, a colorable claim. While the court has\nfound that the solicitation itself did not include the use\nof trade secrets such as pricing information, RBC was\na potential client of [the plaintiff]; was an entity [the\nplaintiff] had tried to do business with and clearly hoped\nto do business with in the future. Wilmott and Carreiro\nwere client contacts developed by Bergmann while\n[working for the plaintiff]. Both Wells and Akerman\nagree that potential clients and current clients can be\nproprietary in nature and can be and often are consid-\nered trade secrets. To the extent that Bergmann was\nunder a duty not to disclose such information, his solici-\ntation of RBC on behalf of EP could give rise to a good\nfaith claim of a CUTSA violation. The court did not\nresolve this aspect of the CUTSA claim, however,\nbecause it did not need to do so. The CUTSA claim\npremised upon the RBC solicitation was colorable. That\nthe conduct, for the reasons articulated above, could\nnot be the basis for an award of damages or the granting\nof injunctive relief, does not alter this conclusion. Los-\ning on the merits for these reasons, does not make the\nclaim without color at the time it is brought or tried.\n  ‘‘Whether or not the CUTSA claim was colorable at\nthe outset, portions of it became objectively specious\nshortly into the discovery process. [The plaintiff]’s per-\n\fsistence in maintaining certain of these CUTSA claims,\nto include those which it dropped before trial and one\nwhich it brought to trial (the box), was motivated by\nimproper purposes.’’ (Footnotes altered.)\n   On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the court’s bad\nfaith determination on the grounds that the court ‘‘com-\npletely misapprehend[ed] [its] concerns relating to EP’s\nability to customize its products after Bergmann left\n[its employ] and joined EP in 2010’’ and ‘‘ignore[d]’’\ncertain facts regarding EP’s product upgrades. (Empha-\nsis omitted.) The plaintiff’s arguments in this regard are\nbelied by the trial court’s thorough decision addressing\nthose very issues. The record supports the trial court’s\ndetermination and it is not the role of this court to retry\nthose issues.10 We thus reject the plaintiff’s contention\nthat the trial court’s bad faith determination was\nerroneous.\n                            V\n   The plaintiff finally claims that the trial court erred\nin awarding attorney’s fees to EP on the basis of its\nfinding of bad faith against the plaintiff without appor-\ntioning that award to only the claims found to have\nbeen made in bad faith. We disagree.\n   At the conclusion of its October 16, 2014 memoran-\ndum of decision, the court directed the parties to con-\ntact the court officer to schedule a hearing on the\ndefendants’ request for attorney’s fees. On March 6,\n2015, EP filed a motion for attorney’s fees, costs and\npostjudgment interest pursuant to § 35-54. The court\nheld a hearing on that motion on March 16, 2015.\nAlthough the plaintiff did not file a written objection\nto EP’s motion prior to the hearing, its counsel\nexpressed at the hearing that it objected to the motion\nand that it assumed that the hearing would be eviden-\ntiary. Counsel for the plaintiff also requested permission\nto file a memorandum in opposition to EP’s motion\nafter the hearing. The court stated: ‘‘Well, to the extent\nthat either side wants to put on evidence, I’m certainly\ngoing to permit that.’’ The court also indicated that it\nwould permit the plaintiff to file a memorandum follow-\ning the hearing. The court then asked counsel for EP\nto proceed on his motion. Counsel for EP indicated to\nthe court that it was relying as evidence for its claim\nfor attorney’s fees the affidavits that he had attached\nto his March 6, 2015 motion. Those affidavits were\nmarked by the court as defendants’ exhibit A. By way\nof objection to the amount of attorney’s fees requested\nby EP, the plaintiff argued that certain of the time billed\nby counsel for EP should be segregated out of their bill\nbecause it did not concern the claims that the trial court\nhad determined were maintained in bad faith. Upon\ninquiry by the court, the plaintiff agreed that the court\nshould look at the billing records from February, 2013,\nup ‘‘to the time of trial and make a reduction because\nthe product technology was off the table during that\n\ftime period . . . .’’ Following its argument that certain\nbilling should be excised by way of timing, the court\nasked, ‘‘Anything further by way of . . . putting me on\nnotice of what you anticipate challenging from a factual\nstandpoint, or a legal argument you’d like to present?’’\nThe plaintiff responded only that it did not believe that\nEP’s claim for costs were appropriate under the law,\nand stated that it would brief that argument fully. The\ncourt advised counsel that once it received all of the\nparties’ posthearing filings, it would assess ‘‘whether\n[it could] take it on the papers or whether [it would]\nneed to bring everybody back in.’’ Counsel for the defen-\ndant thanked the court and the court set a briefing\nschedule, after which it stated, consistent with its ear-\nlier statement: ‘‘And I will review everything that is\nsubmitted, and I will decide at that point whether I can\nresolve the question of award on papers, or whether I\nneed to bring you back. If, having reviewed each other’s\nsubmissions, you think one way or the other, then you\nshould communicate to [the court officer] whether the\ncourt can take it on the papers or you feel strongly that\nyou want to come back. As I said, I’ll have your input\non that, and ultimately I will decide whether I take it\non the papers.’’\n   On April 7, 2015, the plaintiff filed an objection to\nEP’s motion for attorney’s fees, costs and interest, in\nwhich it stated: ‘‘The issue for the court’s determination\nnow is the reasonableness of [EP]’s request for attor-\nney’s fees for the plaintiff’s maintenance of claims of\nmisappropriation of the plaintiff’s product technology\nand box design after 2011.’’ The plaintiff argued, inter\nalia, that EP’s claimed amount of attorney’s fees failed\nto properly apportion the amount of time spent on the\nclaims that the court found to have been pursued in\nbad faith, versus its colorable claims, and posited that\nthe appropriate award of attorney’s fees, after proper\napportionment, would be $60,998.70. The plaintiff also\nobjected to EP’s counsel billing their full hourly rate\nfor time spent traveling as unreasonable.11\n   In response to the plaintiff’s objection, EP argued\nthat the plaintiff’s calculation of attorney’s fees was\nbased upon the incorrect premise that if a billable item\ninvolves both a colorable claim and a bad faith claim,\nthen it cannot be recovered. EP argued to the con-\ntrary—that the plaintiff’s colorable claims and bad faith\nclaims were so intertwined that they could not be sepa-\nrated. The plaintiff filed a surreply to EP’s response,\nand EP filed a reply to the plaintiff’s surreply, wherein\nboth parties reiterated their respective positions on the\napportionment of fees between colorable claims and\nthose made in bad faith. Nowhere in any of those post-\nhearing filings did either party request an evidentiary\nhearing before the court.12\n   On May 21, 2015, the court issued an order in which\nit concluded that ‘‘it would be impossible, due to the\n\fintertwined nature of the CUTSA claims with the tort\nclaims, as well as the intertwined nature of both the\ncolorable and noncolorable CUTSA claims, to attempt\nto segregate out specific invoice entries or apportion\nonly some of the fees to the CUTSA claim brought in\nbad faith.’’ The court thus awarded attorney’s fees in\nthe amount of $171,203.40, which was the amount\nrequested by EP, minus a 10 percent reduction to\naccount for the ‘‘defense of the other causes of action\nand/or the colorable CUTSA claims . . . .’’\n  On appeal, the plaintiff challenges the award of attor-\nney’s fees to the plaintiff on the grounds that EP failed to\nmeet its burden of distinguishing between the plaintiff’s\ncolorable claims and those maintained in bad faith and\napportioning the claimed fees accordingly, and that the\ncourt erred in accepting EP’s allegedly unfounded con-\ntention that its defense of the plaintiff’s colorable claims\nconstituted ‘‘approximately 10 percent of the case.’’\n   ‘‘We review the reasonableness of the court’s award\nof attorney’s fees under the abuse of discretion stan-\ndard. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard of\nreview, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption\nin favor of upholding the trial court’s ruling, and only\nupset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus,\nour] review of [the amount of attorney’s fees awarded]\nis limited to the questions of whether the trial court\ncorrectly applied the law and reasonably could have\nreached the conclusion it did. . . . A court has few\nduties of a more delicate nature than that of fixing\ncounsel fees. The issue grows even more delicate on\nappeal . . . for the trial court is in the best position\nto evaluate the circumstances of each case.’’ (Internal\nquotation marks omitted.) East Windsor v.

In light of the trial court’s determina-\ntion that the plaintiff’s claims were intertwined to the\npoint that it would be impossible to separate them,\nwe disagree, as did the trial court, with the plaintiff’s\ncontention that EP failed to meet its burden of distin-\nguishing between the plaintiff’s colorable claims and\nthose maintained in bad faith. The court was free to\naccept or reject EP’s contention that its defense of\nthe plaintiff’s colorable claims accounted for only 10\npercent of the claimed fees and properly exercised its\n\fdiscretion in fashioning its award of attorney’s fees\nto EP.\n      The judgment is affirmed.\n      In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  1\n     As a preliminary matter, the trial court explained: ‘‘The court does not\nattempt to include in this decision all of the evidence relied upon in the\ncourt’s factual findings. The court has considered all of the evidence admit-\nted, and the reference to any subset of the evidence presented should not\nbe construed as identifying the exclusive basis for the court’s ruling. Neither\nshould the court’s failure to identify or mention specific evidence give rise\nto an inference that such evidence has not been considered.’’\n   2\n     The trial court noted: ‘‘Given [the plaintiff]’s access to this information,\nand the additional evidence offered by the defendants as to EP’s relative\ncapabilities and products through the years, Akerman’s testimony that he\nbelieved that EP could not perform customizations, and that EP did not\nhave board games in its inventory is not credible.’’\n   3\n     The court explained: ‘‘[The plaintiff] also asserts that EP misappropriated\nits pricing strategies and information. [The plaintiff] adduced little if any\nevidence from which such a finding might be made. The court does not\nherein further address this claim. [The plaintiff] claims EP and Bergmann\nmisappropriated client lists. [The plaintiff] offers no evidence of such a\nclaim, with the possible exception of RBC, which was, at best, a potential\nfuture client. Bergmann testified he did not take any lists, and Wells testified\nthat Bergmann did not provide any lists. This testimony was credited. The\ncourt does not herein further address this claim. [The plaintiff] also asserts\nthat EP and Bergmann misappropriated, used and disseminated [the plain-\ntiff’s] ‘confidential information.’ Aside from the claims addressed above,\n[the plaintiff] offers no evidence from which such a finding could be made.\nThe court does not herein further address this claim. Indeed, [the plaintiff]\ncontinues to make broad, sweeping allegations of wrongdoing by EP even\nthough the evidence at trial as to such sweeping allegations was utterly\nlacking.’’\n   4\n     The court further noted: ‘‘The plaintiff’s case relies largely on the testi-\nmony of Jonas Akerman, who presented on many issues, as not credible.\nThe court observed Mr. Akerman’s unwillingness to let go of beliefs or\nsuspicions which were concededly based upon false premises. He offered\ntestimony on ‘facts’ only to have those same ‘facts’ to be revealed as his\npersonal opinion, for which no corroborating evidence was offered. He was\nunreasonably intransigent when confronted with contrary evidence. His\ntestimony was often refuted by other witnesses as well as the documentary\nevidence submitted. He was evasive and defensive. At times, his testimony\nwas simply inexplicable.’’\n   5\n     The court denied EP’s claim for costs on the ground that § 35-54 does\nnot provide for such an award. The court also awarded postjudgment interest\nat the rate of 5 percent per annum. Neither of those orders is challenged\non appeal.\n   6\n     The plaintiff also sought clarification as to an order requiring the defen-\ndants to disclose their expert. That portion of the court’s order is not relevant\nto the claims on appeal.\n   7\n     The plaintiff also argues for the first time in its reply brief to this court\nthat the trial court applied the incorrect legal standard to its bad faith\ndetermination. It is well settled that this court does not address claims\nraised for the first time in a reply brief.\n   8\n     The trial court noted: ‘‘At trial, [the plaintiff] produced, for the first time,\na page from a multipage document which was prepared by [the plaintiff]’s\nfinancial advisors during the 2008 due diligence. It is a one page summary\nwhich encapsulates the advisor’s assessment of EP and the viability of an\nacquisition. The one page summary does not include any mention of EP’s\ncapacity to customize its product to suit the needs of its clients. Akerman\ntestified that this is a document on which he relied in coming to his belief\nthat EP had lost its previous ability to customize until after Bergmann was\nhired. However, the document itself was part of a bigger document which\nincluded a second page containing a fair amount of information on EP’s\ncustomization capacity. [The] plaintiff’s effort to bolster what the court has\nfound to be false testimony with an incomplete and misleading document\nis troubling. While this court does not go so far as to conclude that Akerman\nsought to mislead the court by withholding the second page, it does appear\nto this court that he was trying to bolster his own false statement that he\n\fdid not believe EP had a high level of customization capability.’’\n   9\n     ‘‘The plaintiff also sought: a list of current and former clients; a descrip-\ntion of which products were sold to which clients; and other clearly protected\ntrade secret information.’’\n   10\n      The plaintiff also claims on appeal that the trial court improperly deter-\nmined that it had made a claim of misappropriation of the ‘‘Conductor’’ box\nitself. The plaintiff argues that its claim concerning the box concerned only\nthe identity of the designer of the box. A reading of the plaintiff’s brief to\nthis court, in which it cites its own posttrial brief to the trial court belies\nthis argument. As the plaintiff stated in its brief to this court: ‘‘In its posttrial\nmemorandum, the plaintiff argued that ‘the unique design of [its] Conductor\nbox, including who makes it and how,’ were trade secrets as defined\nunder CUTSA.’’\n   11\n      The plaintiff also challenged EP’s request for costs and postjudgment\ninterest. The court did not award costs and although it did award postjudg-\nment interest, the plaintiff has not challenged that award on appeal.\n   12\n      The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in denying its request\nfor an evidentiary hearing. Our review of the record reveals that this is a\nmisrepresentation of the proceedings that occurred before the trial court.\nAlthough counsel for the plaintiff suggested a desire to cross-examine coun-\nsel for EP as to the reasonableness of the claimed fees, he was unable,\nupon inquiry by the court, to articulate a basis for such an examination,\nand, instead, challenged the apportionment of the billing between the color-\nable and the bad faith claims. Counsel for the plaintiff indicated to the court\nthat he would fully address that argument in his posthearing brief. The court\nindicated to counsel for both parties that if either of them wanted to come\nback for an evidentiary hearing following the posthearing briefing, to so\nindicate to the court or the court would consider the issue on the papers.\nNeither party made such a request. The quoted portions of the hearing that\nare cited herein, in addition to the fact that neither party requested an\nevidentiary hearing in their posthearing briefs, belie the plaintiff’s claim that\nthe trial court denied its request for such an opportunity.\n\f</pre>",
