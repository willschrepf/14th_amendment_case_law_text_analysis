Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 4\n\f                                 REPLY POINT ONE\n\n       Jenkins’ contract should have been repaired to her benefit, not to\n       the benefit of the CISD.\n\n       This issue is separate from the §§21.201 and 21.206 arguments in this case.\n\nThis Court could rule that Jenkins’ ambiguous contract was for “principal,”\n\nwithout confronting the statutory issues. Neither appellee responded to Jenkins\n\narguments regarding Texas Education Code §21.002(a), which says:\n\n       A school district shall employ each classroom teacher, principal,\n       librarian, nurse, or school counselor under … a term contract, as\n       provided by Subchapter E.\n\n(emphasis added) (Jenkins’ brief p. 27) A principal is entitled to a contract. An\n\n“administrator” is not statutorily entitled to a contract, though the school board\n\nmay offer contracts to whomever it chooses. As a generic administrator, Jenkins\n\nhas lost the benefit and protection of this statute without receiving any quasi-due-\n\nprocess protection guaranteed by Texas Education Code Chapter 21.\n\n       The commissioner’s brief muddies the contract analysis by enunciating a\n\nnew test: If the contract position is ambiguous, the boilerplate reassignment clause\n\nin the contract and the superintendent’s authority gives the district the unrestrained\n\nright to reassign, as long as the employee is certified in the new position. (Comm’r\n\nbrief, p. 32) Since every principal is certified to be an assistant principal, but also\n\ncertified to teach, this is obviously problematic, and not such a workable solution.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 5\n\fSee Title 19 Tex. Admin. Code §241.20 (3). Likewise, both appellees rely on the\n\nboilerplate language of the contract that says the employee is subject to\n\nreassignment into any position the employee is certified or qualified to perform.\n\n(CISD brief p. 30)        If contract language controlled, an employee could be\n\nreassigned to any position.\n\n       The CISD and commissioner never acknowledge in their briefs that §21.206\n\nhas always tempered the reassignment clause of a school employment contract. No\n\nmatter the contract language, an employee to whom §21.206 applies may not be\n\nreassigned outside of her “professional capacity.” Similarly, a superintendent’s\n\nstatutory authority does not extend to reassigning an employee to whom §21.206\n\napplies outside of her professional capacity. The CISD and commissioner cannot\n\nseriously dispute this legal restriction on reassignments.\n\n       Nor does either appellee respond to or dispute that the ambiguous,\n\nboilerplate contract should be construed against the school district author, as\n\nJenkins argued in her brief. (Jenkins’ brief p. 28) With respect to the parties’\n\nintentions, Ms. Jenkins certainly believed she signed a contract to be principal for\n\nthe 2011-13 school years, as she told the school board in October 2011 at her\n\ngrievance hearing:\n\n       On June 28, months after I signed a new two-year contract to lead\n       Drew Intermediate School as principal for the 2011/13 school year, Dr.\n       Moore removed me as principal and reassigned me to an A.P. at C.H.S.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 6\n\f       I cannot imagine what transpired in those months to warrant such a\n       drastic action.\n\n(R. 260, local transcript, p. 20)\n\n       As amicus TASB writes, “a ‘professional capacity’ may be defined by\n\ncontractual agreement,” even if the professional capacity does not exist in §21.201.\n\n(TASB brief pp. 26-27) In other words, an employee and the school district may\n\ncontract for a narrower job title or professional capacity than listed in §21.201.\n\nJenkins agrees that §21.201 is a floor and not a ceiling with respect to professional\n\ncapacities.\n\n       Therefore a contract for “principal” is harmonious with this analysis,\n\nbecause “principal” is specifically listed in §21.201, and it gives Jenkins the\n\nbenefit of her bargain. Finally, the reassignment provision in the contract referred\n\nto by the commissioner and CISD is still effective:               Jenkins can indeed be\n\nreassigned as principal of another campus in the district.\n\n                                 REPLY POINT TWO\n\n       The commissioner’s ruling contradicts the plain language of\n       §§21.201 and 21.206. Principal is different than administrator\n       and supervisor.\n\n       The commissioner is not owed deference when his interpretations contradict\n\nthe plain language of a non-technical statute. First Am. Title Ins. Co. v. Combs,\n\n258 S.W. 3d 627, 631 (Tex. 2008) There is nothing ambiguous about §21.201 that\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 7\n\fbegins, “In this subchapter … ‘teacher’ means … principal ...” Applying the\n\nunambiguous law to the undisputed facts in this case, Principal Jenkins must be\n\nemployed in the same professional capacity from year to year, unless the district\n\ngives her the quasi-due-process rights afforded by the term contract nonrenewal\n\nlaws.    The commissioner has already opined that superintendents, teachers,\n\ncounselors, librarians, nurses are entitled to these rights as they are each listed in\n\n§21.201. This case only addresses the position of “principal,” the only specific\n\nposition in §21.201 that is omitted from the commissioner’s consideration in\n\n§21.206.\n\n        When a teacher signs his contract in the spring, he knows he will be a\n\nteacher in the fall. He might teach at a different campus, or teach a different grade\n\nor subject; but he will be a teacher. When a nurse signs her contract in the spring,\n\nshe knows she will be a nurse in the fall, subject to a geographical reassignment.\n\nThe same is true for a librarian, counselor and superintendent. Regardless of\n\ncontract language or the superintendent’s authority, §21.206 guarantees this and\n\nappellees do not dispute it.\n\n        A principal must be employed under a written contract, whereas a generic\n\nadministrator has no such guarantee. Tex. Educ. Code §21.002.                  But when a\n\nprincipal signs her contract in the spring, she is immediately at risk of losing this\n\nlegal right and the benefit of her bargain because she is considered to be a generic\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 8\n\fadministrator by the school district and the commissioner.               She might be an\n\nassistant principal. She might be something as vague as “program specialist II”\n\nwhich may or may not be a certified position; may or may not be a contract\n\nposition; and which has no definition in law. See Montgomery v. Richardson\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., TEA Docket No. 007-R10-1008 (Comm’r Educ. 2012) (Appx. 3,\n\naffirming reassignment from principal to “program specialist II.”)                   Jenkins\n\ncertainly lost the benefit of her bargain when she signed a contract as middle\n\nschool principal in the spring of 2011, and returned to school in the fall as one of\n\nfour high school assistant principals.\n\n       The commissioner says the Texas Education Code mentions administrator\n\nmultiple times outside of Chapter 21, Subchapter E. (Comm’r brief, pp. 8-10)\n\nThere is no need go outside Texas Education Code Chapter 21, Subchapter E\n\nwhere the introductory phrase of §21.201 says, “In this subchapter ‘teacher’ means\n\n… principal ...”      But if one ventures outside of Chapter 21, Subchapter E,\n\nadministrator is more conspicuous by its absence. According to Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§21.002, a principal is entitled to a contract, but an “administrator” is not. Neither\n\nis a “program specialist II.” By reassigning a principal into a generic administrator\n\nposition such as assistant principal, a school district can remove a principal from\n\nher contract without any quasi-due-process protections guaranteed by law.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 9\n\f       Appellees mischaracterize Jenkins’ case as one questioning the legitimacy of\n\nthe administrator capacity. Of course, administrators exist in fact and in law. But\n\nit is a term even the commissioner of education has described as “generic.”\n\nCarpenter v. Wichita Falls Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 0247-R3-491 (Tex.\n\nComm’r Educ. 1993) (Jenkins’ brief, Appx. 8). Principal, by its distinct and\n\nspecialized treatment in the law, is a specialized subset of administrator.\n\n       Proving Jenkins’ point, the commissioner reminds us that state law\n\npreviously heaped all administrators together for evaluation purposes, but now has\n\nsegregated principal evaluations from all other administrator evaluations.\n\n(commissioners brief p. 9, citing Tex. Educ Code §§21.354 and 21.3541.)\n\nMoreover, the TEA regulations in place before and after the facts of this case\n\nrefine the administrator evaluation process and distinguish between superintendent,\n\nprincipal, and all other administrators. (Title 19 Tex. Admin. Code §§150.1021;\n\n150.1022) (Appx. 4)\n\n       Amicus TASB claims that administrator is defined in state regulations as\n\nspecifically including principals and assistant principals. (TASB brief, p. 18, citing\n\n19 Tex. Admin. Code Chap. 229.) This is misleading. The TASB citation is to a\n\nvery specific regulation regarding data collection for educator preparation\n\nprograms and has nothing to do with contract reassignments. The full definition,\n\nwhich TASB omits, says an administrator is, “For purposes of the surveys and\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch.

Admin. Code. §229.3 for a variety of\n\nexamples: “… school principals and administrators … shall provide … data and\n\ninformation required by this chapter; “the school administrator and principal …”;\n\n“Principals or designated administrators ….”) (Appx. 4, emphases added) This\n\nfurther demonstrates that a principal is not a generic administrator, because it is\n\ndistinguished in the law.\n\n       The commissioner has confused “administrator” with “supervisor.” Section\n\n21.201 does not use “administrator,” though it does use “supervisor.” The Texas\n\nEducation Code distinguishes between principal and a generic supervisor\n\n(emphases and brackets added on the following):\n\n   • Section 7.064(a).AThe commissioner shall develop an online survey\n     to be administered statewide at least biennially to superintendents,\n     principals, supervisors, classroom teachers, counselors, and other\n     appropriate full-time professional employees who are required to hold\n     a certificate issued under Subchapter B, Chapter 21.\n\n   • Sections 21.101(1) and 21.201(1): “Teacher” means a superintendent,\n     principal, supervisor, classroom teacher, counselor, or other full-time\n     professional employee who is required to hold a certificate issued\n     under Subchapter B, or a nurse.

(See Tex. Educ. Code §§21.003 requiring the\n\ncertification of all administrators; See §21.355 rendering all administrator\n\nevaluations confidential.)\n\n\n                                REPLY POINT THREE\n\n       Appellees exaggerate the effects of Jenkins’ case. This case would\n       not overturn decades of precedent. The legislature has not\n       acquiesced in the commissioner’s decision.\n\n       Crosby ISD mischaracterizes Jenkins case as “once a principal, always a\n\nprincipal.” (CISD brief pp. 11; 32-33) To be clear, Jenkins desires quasi-due-\n\nprocess protections guaranteed to her by law before she is reassigned outside of her\n\nprofessional capacity, as required by §21.206.           She is not entitled to tenure as\n\nprincipal, nor has she argued this.\n\n       Appellees posit that adding principal to the list of professional capacities in\n\n§21.206 would overturn 30 years of precedent. The commissioner told the Court\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 12\n\fbelow that he, “has repeatedly held that a principal and assistant principal are in the\n\nsame professional capacity … The Court should not overturn nearly 30 years of\n\nprecedent.” (Clerk’s record p. 239; commissioner’s trial brief, p. 9) The CISD\n\ntold the Court below that “… the Commissioner has issued a number of decisions\n\nfinding that a principal was appropriately reassigned to an assistant principal\n\nposition …” (Clerk’s record p. 284; CISD trial brief p. 16)\n\n       Both appellees greatly mischaracterize the commissioner’s jurisprudence. In\n\nreality, prior to Jenkins filing her case with the commissioner in 2011, the\n\ncommissioner had issued only one decision which specifically addressed a\n\nprincipal to assistant principal reassignment. Pasqua v. Fort Stockton Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., TEA Docket No. 011-R3-1102 (Comm’r Educ. 2002) (CISD brief, Tab 7).\n\nIn that case, the principal argued that his reassignment to assistant principal\n\nviolated due process, the district’s duty of good faith and fair dealing, the Open\n\nMeetings Act, and was constructive discharge. Pasqua provides no analysis of\n\n§§21.201 and 21.206, or “same professional capacity.” Further, in Pasqua no\n\nclaim was made about an ambiguous job title in the contract, as in the case at bar.\n\n       In another case previous to Jenkins, the commissioner approved a\n\nreassignment of a principal to another principal position. Underwood v. West Rusk\n\nCo. Consolid. Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 062-R3-198 (Comm’r Educ. 1998)\n\n(CISD brief Tab 8) The commissioner erroneously states that Underwood is a\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 13\n\fprincipal to assistant principal reassignment. (“There, like here, a middle school\n\nprincipal was reassigned to be a high school assistant principal.”) (Comm’r brief,\n\np. 16)    While the reassignment in that case was initially broad, it was from\n\nprincipal of two grades to principal of three grades. (“Petitioner is expected to\n\nfunction as principal to seventh, eighth and ninth grade students instead of seventh\n\nand eighth grades only.” Underwood, p. 3, CISD brief Tab 8) The principal in\n\nUnderwood attempted to preserve the “same exact position,” which Chapter 21\n\ndoes not protect, clearly distinguishing it from the case at bar.\n\n       Although Barich is 30 years old, Jenkins’ case is one of first impression\n\nchallenging a principal to assistant principal reassignment via §21.206. All other\n\nprincipal to assistant principal cases cited by appellees post-date Jenkins’ case.\n\n       Further undercutting appellees’ legislative acquiescence argument is that\n\nJenkins’ argument comports with the commissioner’s rationale. In 30 years, the\n\ncommissioner has recognized every specific position in §21.201 - superintendent,\n\nteacher, school counselor, librarian, and nurse - as a professional capacity.\n\nJenkins’ argument merely extends this natural trajectory to include principals, the\n\nonly specific position omitted from consideration. Moreover, she does not argue\n\nagainst the validity of the generic “administrator” professional capacity, only that it\n\nshould not apply to a principal and should not be inserted into her ambiguous\n\ncontract. This Court could narrowly decide that “principal” is a “professional\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 14\n\fcapacity,” leaving intact for another day the mystery of the commissioner’s view\n\nthat the positions in §21.201 “may or may not be professional capacities” in\n\n§21.206. Jenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ. Agency Docket No. 043-\n\nR10-1211 (Comm’r Educ. 2013) (Jenkins’ brief Appx. 1, p. 24).\n\n                                REPLY POINT FOUR\n\n       Appellees misstate facts regarding Jenkins’ duties as a high school\n       assistant principal and whether Jenkins waived the Barich issue.\n\n       Here, for the purposes of comparing her principal to assistant principal\n\nduties, Crosby ISD recites at length Jenkins’ alleged, new duties as a high school\n\nassistant principal. (CISD brief p. 3) The commissioner joins with CISD in\n\nreciting Jenkins’ specific assistant principal duties, and does so by breaking them\n\ninto bullet points. (Comm’r brief pp. 2-3) But both citations directly contradict the\n\ncommissioner’s decision in this case, where he found, “The local record does not\n\nindicate with specificity what Petitioner’s duties as assistant principal … are”\n\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ. Agency Docket No. 043-R10-1211\n\n(Comm’r Educ. 2013) (Jenkins’ brief Appx. 1, p. 2, finding of fact 4). Crosby ISD\n\nnever objected to this finding and it is too late now. The commissioner’s brief is\n\ndirectly at odds with the commissioner’s decision.\n\n       The source used by both appellees is the superintendent’s September 16,\n\n2011 level-two grievance decision he issued to Ms. Jenkins. (R. pp. 284-286) Not\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 15\n\fcoincidentally, Jenkins had never been given the legalistic set of assistant principal\n\nduties until she filed the grievance, the CISD hired lawyers, and the superintendent\n\nissued his level two decision.\n\n       The commissioner has held that a grievance decision cannot be construed as\n\nfact. “A level II decision is a decision by a finder of fact, it is not evidence of the\n\nfact findings contained therein.” Chilton v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ.\n\nAgency Docket No. 031-R10-0107 (Comm’r Educ. 2009) (Appx. 1, Conclusion of\n\nLaw 9) In another case, the issue was whether the teacher had timely filed the\n\ngrievance. The commissioner said, “Although [the school district’s] decisions on\n\n[the teacher’s] grievance reference the [grievance] policy requirements, the policy\n\nitself is absent from the local record,” concluding that he could not make the\n\ndetermination from statements made within the district’s grievance decision.\n\nHigereda v. Valley View Indep. Sch. Dist., TEA Docket No. 027-R10-12-2013\n\n(Comm’r Educ. 2014) (Appx. 2, p. 3, brackets added for clarity).\n\n       Accordingly, the superintendent’s level-two decision cannot be construed as\n\nevidence. The only evidence comes from the CISD job descriptions, which the\n\ncommissioner improperly ignored, and from the law.                  The meaningless job\n\ndescription for principal says, “The person chosen should be bright, experienced,\n\nand capable of working with a staff having the same capabilities.” (R. 292) While\n\nthis job description is lacking, state law describes a principal’s job in great detail.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 16\n\fThe equally vague, CISD assistant principal job description says, “Provide students\n\nwith the appropriate learning activities and experience designed to fulfill their\n\npotential for intellectual, emotional, physical and social growth.” (R. 293) While\n\nnot a model of clarity, it is some evidence of Jenkins’ duties as assistant principal.\n\n       Appellees now say that Jenkins waived a factual comparison of her job\n\nduties, thereby waiving the Barich issue. Barich v. San Felipe-Del Rio Cons.\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ. Agency Docket No. 117-R1a-484 (Comm’r Educ.\n\n1985) (CISD brief, pp. 28-29) In its brief, Crosby ISD says:\n\n       At no time, nor in any grievance hearing, did Jenkins argue that the\n       duties outlined for her current assistant principal position were untrue,\n       inaccurate or needed further clarification. Nor did Jenkins claim that\n       her principal duties … were different than her … duties as an\n       assistant principal…”\n\n(CISD brief, pp. 2-3) Although the commissioner has never before held that\n\nBarich only applies to a factual comparison of the jobs, here is what Jenkins’\n\nlawyer told the school board at her October 2011, level-three grievance meeting:\n\n       We asked for the job descriptions in this district for principal and\n       assistant principal because we wanted to compare them … These\n       …[were] given to us as job descriptions for principal and assistant\n       principal ... There's not much there in the way of a description, but\n       they're certainly different.\n\n(R. 259, hearing transcript p. 14, emphasis and brackets added for clarity) The job\n\ndescriptions leave little to analyze, but they amount to some evidence. Because the\n\nCISD job descriptions were inadequate, Jenkins argued more forcefully that the\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 17\n\fprincipal’s duties defined by law prove the jobs are substantially dissimilar.\n\nProving her point, the CISD sought to define her assistant principal duties in a\n\nlevel-two grievance decision, and could change them at any time. However, state\n\nlaw restricts the school district’s authority to amend a principal’s duties.\n\n     Because Jenkins focused on the legal differences between the two jobs, on\n\nappeal to the Texas Education Agency, the commissioner found sua sponte that\n\nJenkins waived the Barich issue. The commissioner said Jenkins failed to argue\n\nthat her duties as principal factually differed from her assistant principal duties.\n\nThe commissioner repeats this here:\n\n       Her petition for review did not claim that her reassignment was\n       inappropriate because the two jobs at issue were actually dissimilar.\n       Nor did her briefing raise the claim that the two jobs at issue were\n       actually dissimilar.\n\n(Comm’r brief pp. 27-28)         In her petition for review at the Texas Education\n\nAgency (TEA), Jenkins pled: “The duties of Principal and Assistant Principal are\n\nnot within the same professional capacity … The position of campus principal is\n\n… a unique position defined by state law, and is unlike any other school employee\n\nposition.” (R. 157, emphasis added). In her brief at the TEA, Jenkins argued:\n\n       Barich had no evidence comparing the positions. Here, Jenkins’s\n       evidence reflects a stark difference between principal and assistant\n       principal.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 18\n\f(R. 142, fn 4, emphasis added) The last sentence in Jenkins’ TEA brief said: “As\n\nprincipal, Jenkins was the instructional leader, and she supervised an entire campus\n\nstaff. As assistant principal, she only operates in a supporting role.” (R. 152)\n\nFinally, at the same October 2011 school board hearing, Ms. Jenkins personally\n\ntold the school board:\n\n       There are five administrators on the high school campus, four of those\n       positions are A.P.s; and I will have no more authority than any of the\n       other A.P.s to turn the school around. The campus is led by the\n       principal, and the role of an A.P. is to follow that lead.\n\n(R. 260, hearing transcript p. 21, brackets added)\n\n       Amicus TASB asserts that “many principals consider an assistant principal\n\nposition at the high school to be a professionally advantageous move from …\n\nelementary or intermediate/middle school ... Additionally, such principals view this\n\n… as a logical professional ‘stepping stone,’ …” (TASB brief, p. 33) There are\n\ntwo reasons why this is either incorrect or irrelevant:\n\n   1. For those principals who desire a reassignment to assistant principal, it will\n\n       be by agreement. This case will have no impact on those principals.\n\n   2. A demotion is in the eyes of the beholder, and unlike amicus Texas\n\n       Elementary Principals and Supervisors Association, TASB does not\n\n       represent the views of administrators.\n\nEarlier in her career at CISD, Jenkins had already served as a Crosby High School\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 19\n\fassistant principal, as she told the school board in October 2011:                “I'm very\n\nfamiliar with the role of an A.P. In fact, it was my performance as an A.P. at\n\nC.H.S. [Crosby High School] that resulted in my promotion to principal in 2003.”\n\n(R. 260, hearing transcript p. 21, brackets added) A return to CHS as assistant\n\nprincipal is not an agreed promotion, but rather an assignment outside of Jenkins’\n\nprofessional capacity.\n\n       In sum, Jenkins placed the job descriptions into evidence, specifically\n\nargued to the school board that the two jobs were different, factually and legally;\n\nand specifically argued at the TEA that her evidence - the job descriptions and the\n\nlaw - was more compelling than the evidence in the Barich case. Jenkins did not\n\nwaive the Barich issue.\n\n                                 REPLY POINT FIVE\n\n       Crosby ISD’s argument that Jenkins’ claim “does not involve an\n       expiring contract” thus rendering §21.206 inapplicable, is without\n       merit and has been waived by CISD.\n\n       In its first argument, CISD says that same professional capacity “is triggered\n\nwhen a term contract is about to expire and the board of trustees fails to give\n\ntimely notice of a proposed nonrenewal.” (CISD brief p. 10) Crosby ISD then\n\nstates, “Here, Jenkins received timely and appropriate notice…” (CISD brief p. 10)\n\nThis is a confusing and inaccurate statement. Jenkins’ case exists because she did\n\nnot receive a notice of proposed nonrenewal, thus depriving her of a quasi-due-\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 20\n\fprocess opportunity to defend against the reassignment. Had she received “timely\n\nand appropriate notice,” she would have no §21.206 case.\n\n       Further, CISD says that Jenkins’ claim is not ripe because Jenkins’ brought\n\nher claim “during the term of [her] new contract.” (CISD brief p.10) That is also\n\nan inaccurate statement of law and fact. Jenkins’ contract in question covers the\n\n2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. (R. 294, Jenkins’ brief Appx. 5) Jenkins\n\nsigned the contract on March 2, 2011, but the contract was not effective until\n\nAugust 2011, at the beginning of the 2011-12 school year. (R. 294, Jenkins’ brief\n\nAppx. 5) On June 28, 2011, between the time she signed the contact and the time\n\nthe contract was became effective, she was given notice of reassignment. Her\n\nreassignment was not effective until August 1, 2011, as evidenced by the\n\nsuperintendent’s letter. (R. 291)\n\n       Indeed, CISD concedes in its brief that Jenkins could have resigned penalty-\n\nfree until July 8, 2011. (CISD brief, p. 2) The penalty-free resignation date is 45\n\ndays before the first day of student instruction, which in this case was August 23,\n\n2011. (Tex. Educ. Code §21.210) Thus, Jenkins reassignment occurred between\n\nher contracts and before the 2011-12 school year started.\n\n       On this point, the commissioner is correct:\n\n       Petitioner's claim concerning Texas Education Code section 21.206\n       would not appear to be ripe. However, Petitioner points out that she\n       was employed by Respondent as a principal just prior to her signing\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 21\n\f       her 2011-2013 contract. Hence, during the 2011-2012 school year,\n       Respondent was required to employ Petitioner in the same\n       professional capacity as Petitioner held during the 2010-2011 school\n       year.\n\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist., TEA Docket No. 043-R10-1211 (Comm’r\n\nEduc. 2013, p. 5) (emphasis added).\n\n       For the first time in this litigation, Crosby ISD says the commissioner was\n\n“erroneous and should be reversed …” (CISD brief, p. 13) But Crosby ISD failed\n\nto brief this issue before the commissioner, and failed to file exceptions to the\n\nproposal for decision issued by the commissioner’s administrative law judge which\n\ncontained the same language set out above. (R. 36) “All disagreements with the\n\nfactual findings and legal conclusions of the proposal for decision must be made in\n\nthe parties’ exceptions to the proposal for decision or be waived.” Title 19 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code §157.1059(d). Crosby ISD also failed to file a motion for rehearing,\n\nwhich is a prerequisite to a judicial appeal.             Title 19 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§157.1061(a).\n\n       Further, CISD claims that Jenkins should have pled “demotion” instead of a\n\nviolation of §21.206. (CISD brief, p. 3, p. 11) Whether Jenkins could have filed a\n\nfederal case for a constitutional due process demotion or for discriminatory\n\ndemotion, has no bearing on the analysis here. Since 1995, the commissioner does\n\nnot have jurisdiction over a “demotion” case.              The commissioner only has\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 22\n\fjurisdiction over a violation of the school laws of the state or a violation of a\n\nwritten employment contract. Tex. Educ. Code §7.057(a). Crosby ISD’s argument\n\nis without merit and has been waived.\n\n\n\n                                PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n       Jenkins respectfully requests that she be granted the following relief:\n\n       A.     That this Court reverse the trial court and the decision of the\n\ncommissioner and render for Jenkins;\n\n       B.     That this Court finds that CISD breached Jenkins’ contract and/or\n\nviolated Jenkins’ statutory rights;\n\n       C.     That this Court order CISD to immediately reinstate Jenkins to her\n\nformer position as principal;\n\n       D.

Petitioner is represented by Julie D. Leahy, Attorney at Law, Austin, Texas. Respondent\nis represented by Clay Grover, Attorney at Law, Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge issued a Proposal for Decision recommending that Petitioner’s appeal\nbe granted. Exceptions and replies were timely filed and considered.\n\nFindings of Fact\n\nAfter due consideration of the record and matters officially noticed, it is concluded that the following\nFindings of Fact are established applying the substantial evidence standard.\n\n1. In response to Petitioner’s grievance, Respondent’s board of trustees voted to deny the grievance and\nto uphold the Level II decision.\n\n2. The Level II decision reads in pertinent part as follows:\n       REPORT OF LEVEL TWO CONFERENCE BY SUPERINTENDENT OR DESIGNEE\n       1. Complainant’s Name: Laura Chilton\n       Represented by: Eric J. Davis of Davis and Associates\n        [*2] 2. Position: Teacher Campus/Department: REACH\n\f                                                                                                              Page 2 of 7\n                                    2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *3\n\n3. Date and time of conference: November 2, 2006 at 2:00 p.m.\n4. The facts as presented by the complainant are as follows:\nPressured and mislead into resigning by the Principal-stated the Principal told her that if she did\nnot resign, she would go to HR and have her terminated.\nStated that she did not receive the letter of acceptance of her resignation until after she received\nthe letter of denial of her request to rescind her resignation.\nSubmitted: 2 -- AISD Envelopes Postmarked September 1, 2006 and the other September 6,\n2006.\nSubmitted: Commissioner’s Ruling Docket 115-R8-197 Daniel Suty v Aldine ISD 1997\n5. In my opinion, the allegations made in the original complaint are not adequately supported\nby the facts submitted.\nExplanation:\n. Resignation states the reason for resigning due to travel time it gets to work.\n. The principal stated that she did not tell Ms. Chilton that she would terminate her as this was\nnot within her authority.\n. There is no distinguishing information on the envelopes to determine the contents of either\nenvelope. In discussing HR time frames for mailing letter of acceptance of resignation and the\n [*3] letter of denial of the rescission of resignation requests are as follows:\n    Chilton Resignation Letter                                                      August 24, 2006\n    AISD Letter of Resignation Acceptance Letter                                    August 29, 2006\n    Chilton Request Rescission of Resignation Letter                                August 30, 2006\n                                                                                    (Fax 3:04 PM)\n    Denial of Rescission Request                                                    August 31, 2006\nThe AISD letter of resignation acceptance was mailed on the day that it was signed which was August 29, 2006 therefore, the\nenvelope that Ms. Chilton received had an August 29, 2006 meter on it. Once the resignation was mailed August 29, 2006 it\nwas binding under the law, therefore due notification was given prior to the attempt of rescission by Ms. Chilton on August\n30, 2006.\nEnvelope Dated September 6, 2006- It has been determined that the envelope contained three documents that are sent out to\nall employees leaving the district. Documents include: HR Cover Letter/Directions. Exit Report Form, Personnel Release\nForm.\nEnvelope Dated September 1, 2006-It has been determined that the envelope contained the denial of the rescission request.\n6. In my opinion, the remedy sought by the complainant is not justified by the facts submitted.\nExplanation:\n\nThe written resignation   [*4] was received on August 24, 2006 and formally accepted on August 29,\n2006. Ms. Chilton’s request for rescission was received on August 30, 2006 and formally\ndenied on August 31, 2006. As a result, a vacancy was posted and the principal is active in the\nhiring process. All payout have been completed.\n7. The decision made or recommendations agreed upon as a result of the conference are as\nfollows: None\n                    signed Robert S. Quinn                                      11-15-06\n\f                                                                                              Page 3 of 7\n                                      2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *4\n\n\n                       Signature of Superintendent Designee               Date\n\n3. On August 24, 2006, Petitioner hand delivered a letter of resignation to her principal. The letter\nreads:\n       August 24, 2006\n       Dear Mrs. Fyfe,\n       I am resigning on August 24, 2006 from Alvin ISD. Due to the travel time it takes me to get\n       to work.\n       Thank you,\n       Laura Chilton\n\n4. On September 1, 2006, a letter dated August 31, 2006 from Robert G. Quinn was mailed to\nPetitioner. The letter reads in relevant part:\n       I am sending you this letter in response to the fax that we received from you on August 30, 2006\n       at 3:04 PM. After review, it has been determined that the district is unable to honor your request\n       based on the following facts:\n       . Your written resignation was received and accepted on August [*5] 24, 2006.\n       . The vacancy created by your resignation is currently posted.\n       . The principal is active in the hiring process for filling the vacancy.\n       . Payroll has finalized your payout and you are not an active employee.\n\n5. On September 6, 2006, a letter dated August 29, 2006 from Robert G. Quinn was mailed to\nPetitioner. The letter reads in relevant part:\n       This letter is to inform you of receipt of your letter of resignation dated August 24, 2006. I do\n       hereby accept your resignation for the position of special education teacher, REACH School,\n       effective August 24, 2006.\n       Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your\n       service with Alvin Independent School District and best wishes in your future endeavors.\n\n6. Petitioner had a probationary contract to teach for Respondent for the 2006-2007 school year.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPetitioner contends that Respondent improperly ended her probationary contract. Petitioner contends\nthat she rescinded her offer of resignation before it was accepted.\n\nStandards\n\nThe standards concerning the acceptance of the resignation of a teaching contract after the period for\nunilateral resignation are set forth [*6] in Cantu v. Central Educ. Agency, 884 S.W.2d 565 (Tex.\nApp.-Austin 1994, no writ). Tex. Educ. Code § 21.205(a). An agreement to rescind a teaching contract\nrequires offer, acceptance and consideration. Id. at 566. The dispute between the parties is whether\n\f                                                                                                 Page 4 of 7\n                                     2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *6\n\nPetitioner rescinded her resignation before Respondent accepted her resignation. The Cantu court has\nheld:\n\n   The aphorism ″the offeror is the master of his offer″ reflects the power of the offeror to impose\n   conditions on acceptance of an offer, specify the manner of acceptance, or withdraw the offer\n   before the offeree has effectively exercised the power of acceptance. However, more often than not,\n   an offeror does not expressly authorize a particular mode, medium, or manner of acceptance.\n   Consequently, particularly with parties communicating at a distance, a rule of law is needed to\n   establish the point of contract formation and allocate the risk of loss and *567 inconvenience that\n   inevitably falls to one of the parties between the time that the offeree exercises, and the offeror\n   receives, the acceptance. See 1 Arthur L. Corbin, Contracts § 78 (1963).\n    [*7] [5] As Professor Corbin notes, courts could adopt a rule that no acceptance is effective until\n   received, absent express authorization by the offeror; however, the mailbox rule, which makes\n   acceptance effective on dispatch, closes the deal and enables performance more promptly, and\n   places the risk of inconvenience on the party who originally has power to control the manner of\n   acceptance. Id. Moreover, ″the mailing of a letter has long been a customary and expected way of\n   accepting [an] offer.″ Id. Therefore, ″[e]ven though the offer was not made by mail and there was\n   no [express] authorization, the existing circumstances may be such as to make it reasonable for the\n   offeree to accept by mail and to give the offeror reason to know that the acceptance will be so\n   made.″ Id. In short, acceptance by mail is impliedly authorized if reasonable under the\n   circumstances\n   [6] The Restatement approves and adopts this approach: an acceptance by any medium reasonable\n   under the circumstances is effective on dispatch, absent a contrary indication in the offer.\n   Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 30(2), 63(a), 65, 66 (1979). In addition, the Restatement\n   specifically recognizes that [*8] acceptance by mail is ordinarily reasonable if the parties are\n   negotiating at a distance or even if a written offer is delivered in person to an offeree in the same\n   city. Id. § 65 cmt. c (emphasis added). The same standard, viz., whether the manner of acceptance\n   is reasonable under the circumstances, governs offer and acceptance in commercial transactions\n   under the Texas Business and Commerce Code. See Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 2.206 (West\n   1968).\n\nId. at 566-567. In general, an offer may be accepted by mail. The acceptance letter must be properly\naddressed. The time of acceptance is when a properly addressed acceptance is placed in the mail. Id.\nat 566 n.1. If the offer to resign is accepted before the offer is rescinded, the resignation is complete.\n\nMail Box Rule\n\nPetitioner contends that the mailbox rule does not apply in this case. However, as the above quoted\nportion of Cantu makes clear, acceptance by mail is ordinarily reasonable. Petitioner points to nothing\nin the record to show why this usual standard should not apply in this case. Petitioner’s letter of\nresignation does not specify a method [*9] of acceptance. If Respondent placed its acceptance of\nPetitioner’s resignation in the mail, prior to it receiving Petitioner’s fax rescinding the resignation, the\nresignation is effective.\n\nMailing\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 5 of 7\n                                               2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *9\n\nThe central dispute in the present case is ″When did Respondent mail its acceptance of Petitioner’s\nresignation?″ Petitioner attempted to rescind her offer of resignation by a fax on August 30, 2006 at\n3:04 p.m. If Respondent placed its letter in the mailbox prior to that time, Petitioner’s offer was\naccepted and the resignation is final.\n\nAs this is a case against a school district, it is to be decided based on the local record applying the\nsubstantial evidence rule. Tex. Educ. Code § 7.057(c). The substantial evidence standard is generally\nthe standard specified in Texas Government Code section 2001.174. 19 Tex. Admin. Code §\n157.1073(h). In the present case, Respondent specifically upheld the Level II decision. The Level II\ndecision contains findings of fact. Hence, the Commissioner must determine whether the findings of\nfact are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\nAcceptance Letter\n\nRespondent contends that the letter accepting Petitioner’s resignation is itself [*10] evidence that the\nletter was mailed on August 29, 2006 because the letter is dated August 29, 2006. The date on the letter\nis evidence that the letter was drafted that day. It is not evidence that the letter was properly mailed\non that day.\n\nLevel II Decision\nRespondent also contends that the Level II decision itself is evidence that acceptance was mailed on\nAugust 29, 2006. However, the Level II decision was what was appealed to the board. It can no more\nbe considered evidence than an order of a district judge can be as considered evidence by an appellate\ncourt to prove that the district court’s order was supported by evidence.\nAt oral argument, Respondent’s counsel noted that the Level II decision maker was the individual who\ndrafted the acceptance letter and argued that the Level II decision maker had actual knowledge that the\nletter was mailed on time and of the contents of the two envelopes that bear postage meter dates of\nSeptember 1 and 6, 2006 1\n\n. A decision maker must base his decision [*11] on the evidence, not on personal knowledge. It has\nbeen held:\n     Nothing is more thoroughly established than the proposition that neither a judge nor a juror may\n     act as a witness. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 82, 62 S.Ct. 457, 470, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)\n     (judge); Gregory v. St. Louis Southwestern Railway Co., 377 S.W.2d 847, 853\n     (Tex.Civ.App.-Texarkana 1964), rev’d on other grounds, 387 S.W.2d 27 (Tex.1965) (juror).\n\nSizemore v. Texas State Board of Dental Examiners, 747 S.W.2d 389, 396 (Tex. App.-Dallas 1987)\nreversed on other grounds 759 S.W.2d 114 (Tex. 1988). Perhaps the Level II decision maker knew when\nthe acceptance letter was mailed. If so, he could not rely on his personal knowledge.\nFurther, even if the Level II decision was evidence that the letter was mailed on August 29, 2006, it\nis not evidence that the letter was properly addressed. The Level II decision fails to address this issue.\n1\n     In Rogers v. Texas Optometry Bd., 609 S.W.2d 248 (Tex. Civ. App.-Austin 1980, writ ref’d n.r.e.), administrative action was\noverturned because two board members, who recused themselves testified against a license holder. While the two board members did\nnot sit as fact finders, their influence over the other board members was found to be potentially so great that the court found a lack of\nfairness. Perhaps an even greater lack of fairness would have been found if they did not recuse themselves.\n\f                                                                                              Page 6 of 7\n                                   2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *11\n\nThe mailbox rule only applies if a letter is properly addressed. There is not substantial evidence [*12]\nto support a determination that the offer was accepted before it was withdrawn.\n\nThe only evidence in the record as to when the acceptance was mailed was provided by Petitioner who\ntestified that the acceptance letter came in an envelope that was placed in evidence. This envelope\nbears a postage meter marking which reads September 6, 2006. The evidence in the record\nconclusively establishes that the acceptance letter was mailed on September 6, 2006. cf. Montgomery\nIndep. Sch. Dist v. Davis, 34 S.W.3d 559, 567 (Tex. 2000)(finding in a chapter 21 case that a board\ncould rely on undisputed evidence). Since Petitioner withdrew her offer of resignation before the\nresignation was accepted, Petitioner’s contract for the 2006-2007 school year remained in force.\nPetitioner is entitled to compensation under her 2006-2007 contract.\n\nConclusion\n\nPetitioner’s appeal should be granted. The mailbox rule applies to this case. Petitioner rescinded her\nresignation before it was accepted.\n\nReply to the Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision\n\nRespondent correctly notes that the grievance process lacks the formality of a court and that school\ndistricts have wide latitude [*13] to determine their procedures. However, the Commissioner has made\nclear that the hearing given must be a fair hearing:\n\n   While a district has wide latitude to design its own hearing procedures, a grievant needs to be given\n   a fair opportunity to present his case. Taylor v. Marshall Independent School District, Docket No.\n   130-R10-297 (Comm’r Educ. 1997).\n\nAdams v. Flour Bluff Independent School District, Docket No. 115-R10-598 (Comm’r Educ. 1999). A\nhearing is not fair when instead of relying on the facts presented, a decision maker bases a decision\non personal knowledge. The Level II hearing was not a fair hearing. But even if the Level II hearing\nwere a fair hearing, the Level II hearing decision is not evidence to be considered in determining\nwhether substantial evidence supports the board’s decision.\n\nConclusions of Law\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing Findings of Fact,\nin my capacity as Commissioner of Education, I make the following Conclusions of Law:\n\n1. The Commissioner of Education has jurisdiction over Petitioner’s claims under Texas Education\nCode section 7.057.\n\n2. An appeal of a decision of a school district [*14] under Texas Education Code section 7.057 is to\nbe based on a review of the local record under a substantial evidence standard of review. Tex. Educ.\nCode § 7.057(c).\n\n3. In a case where a school district makes findings of fact, the substantial evidence standard of review\nreferenced in Texas Education Code section 7.057(c) is generally the standard identified in Texas\nGovernment Code section 2001.174. 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 157.1073(h).\n\f                                                                                                 Page 7 of 7\n                                    2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *14\n\n4. An agreement to rescind a teaching contract, after the period for unilateral resignation, requires offer,\nacceptance, and consideration. Tex. Educ. Code § 21.205(a).\n\n5. An offer can be rescinded before it is accepted.\n\n6. An offer can generally be accepted by mail unless the offer specifies another mode of acceptance.\nAs long as no limitations have been placed on acceptance and acceptance by mail is reasonable under\nthe circumstances, an offer may be accepted by mail. If an offer is accepted by mail, acceptance occurs\nupon dispatch of a properly addressed letter.\n\n7. Since Petitioner placed no restrictions as to how her offer could be accepted and under the\ncircumstances of the present case it was reasonable for the offer of resignation to be accepted [*15]\nby mail, Respondent could have accepted Petitioner’s offer by mail.\n\n8. Respondent could not have accepted Petitioner’s offer after August 30, 2006 at 3:04 p.m. because\nPetitioner rescinded her offer at that time.\n\n9. A Level II decision is a decision made by a finder of fact, it is not evidence of the fact findings\ncontained therein.\n\n10. There is not substantial evidence that Respondent mailed its acceptance letter on August 29, 2006.\n\n11. There is not substantial evidence that a properly addressed letter was mailed by Respondent to\nPetitioner on August 29, 2006.\n\n12. The evidence in the local record conclusively establishes that Respondent mailed its letter of\nacceptance on September 6, 2006.\n\n13. Because Petitioner rescinded her offer of resignation prior to Respondent’s acceptance of her offer\nof resignation, no resignation occurred. Petitioner’s 2006-2007 contract was not ended by resignation.\n\n14. Petitioner’s appeal should be granted.\n\nORDER\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed and the foregoing Findings of Fact and\nConclusions of Law, in my capacity as Commissioner of Education, it is hereby\n\nORDERED that Petitioner’s appeal be, and is hereby, GRANTED.

Respondent is represented by Renee Betancourt,\nAttorney at Law, Edinburg, Texas.\n\nThe central issue in this case is that a classroom teacher cannot be an at-will employee, even in the absence of a written\nemployment contract. When a school district board of trustees fails to approve a probationary, term or continuing contract\nfor a classroom teacher, the board is in violation of chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code, which requires that all teachers\nmust be employed under a written contract. The Commissioner has jurisdiction over the case not as an employment\ncontract matter under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B), but as a violation of the school laws of Texas under\nTexas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n\nFindings of Fact\n\nAfter due consideration of the [*2] record and matters officially noticed, it is concluded that the following Findings of Fact\nare supported by substantial evidence and are the Findings of Fact that best support Respondent’s decision:\n\n1. Respondent employed Petitioner as a classroom teacher under probationary contracts for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012\nschool years. Petitioner resigned at the end of the 2011-2012 school year, and then started working for Respondent as a\nclassroom teacher again at the start of the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n2. Petitioner and Respondent both agree that under Texas Education Code chapter 21 and Respondent’s policies, Petitioner\nwas only eligible for a term contract at the start of the 2012-2013 school year. Both parties agree that Petitioner was not\neligible for a probationary contract under Texas Education Code section 21.102.\n\n3. Under its local policy DC (LOCAL), Respondent’s Board of Trustees (″Board″) ″retains final authority for the\nemployment of contractual and noncontractual personnel.″\n\f                                                                                                                Page 2 of 6\n                                           2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *4\n\n4. The Board did not delegate authority to contract with employees on its behalf.\n\n5. On January 11, 2013, Respondent’s employee or a member of Respondent’s Board presented Petitioner with a\nprobationary [*3] contract for the 2012-2013 school year (″Contract″), and Petitioner signed the Contract.\n\n6. The Board neither approved nor signed the Contract. Respondent and Petitioner agree that as a result, there was no\nwritten contract between Respondent and Petitioner for the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n7. Petitioner worked for Respondent as a classroom teacher throughout the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n8. On April 22, 2013, the Board voted to terminate Petitioner at the end of the 2012-2013 school year as ″an employee\ncurrently employed under an Education Code Chapter 21 probationary contract.″\n\n9. Petitioner filed a formal grievance with Respondent on May 14, 2013, asserting, ″I do not have a fully executed contract\nfor the 2012-2013 school year--the contract on which the district relies is not signed by the board...My employment status\nwith the district should be construed as if I held a term contract.″\n\n10. There is no evidence in the record that Petitioner knew or should have known prior to filing his grievance that the Board\nhad not voted to approve the Contract.\n\n11. There is no evidence of Respondent’s local grievance policy in the local record.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTexas public school teachers must be [*4] employed under one of three different contracts: (1) a probationary contract;\n(2) a continuing contract; or (3) a term contract (collectively, ″Chapter 21 contract″). Tex. Educ. Code § 21.002. A\nclassroom teacher cannot be employed as an at-will employee. Nield v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No.\n024-R10-1110 (Comm’r Educ. 2012) (holding that a classroom teacher is entitled to a a probationary, continuing or term\ncontract under chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code even if the teacher is working under an unwritten contract that\nappears to be at-will). Under a probationary contract, the board of trustees may terminate the teacher’s employment at the\nend of the contract period without advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing if the district believes its best interests\nwill be served by terminating the employment. Tex. Educ. Code § 21.103. Under a term contract, a teacher is entitled to\nnotice and a hearing if a school district intends not to renew the teacher’s contract. Tex. Educ. Code §§ 21.206-21.209. The\nTexas Education Code severely restricts which teachers receive a probationary contract: no teacher can be in a\nprobationary contract for more than the first four [*5] years of employment with a school district, and any teacher that\nhas taught for at least five of the last eight years cannot have a probationary contract for more than one year. Tex. Educ.\nCode § 21.102.\n\nPetitioner and Respondent agree that under chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code (″Chapter 21″), Petitioner was not\nlegally eligible to receive a probationary contract for the 2012-2013 school year. Respondent argues that Petitioner’s claim\narose when he signed a document labelled ″Probationary Contract″ because he should have known at that point that\nRespondent was in violation of Chapter 21 and that he was subject to firing as a probationary contract employee, without\nadvanced notice or a hearing. Respondent asserts that Petitioner should have filed a grievance within 15 days of signing\nthe Contract, and since he failed to do so, the Commissioner has no jurisdiction over Petitioner’s claim. Petitioner counters\nthat because Respondent never adopted the Contract, there was no probationary contract for him to grieve. Petitioner\nargues that without a written contract, he became by default a term contract employee because a term contract was the\nonly possible contract he could have [*6] as a matter of law under Chapter 21. Petitioner further argues that his claim did\nnot arise until Respondent improperly terminated his term contract, so his grievance was timely and the Commissioner has\njurisdiction over his appeal.\n\nTimeliness of Grievance\n\nRespondent asserts that the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over the case because Petitioner did not timely file\na grievance after he signed the Contract, but there is no evidence in the local record of what Respondent’s grievance policy\n\f                                                                                                                 Page 3 of 6\n                                           2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *6\n\nrequired. Although Respondent’s decisions on Petitioner’s grievance reference the policy requirements, the policy itself is\nabsent from the local record. Decisions made by a finder of fact cannot serve as evidence of the facts described therein.\nSee, e.g., Chilton v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 031-R10-0107 (Comm’r Educ. 2009). The Commissioner must\nmake his decision based only on ″a review of the record developed at the district level under a substantial evidence standard\nof review.″ Tex. Educ. Code § 7.057(c). The local record in this case does not contain substantial evidence to support\nRespondent’s holding that Petitioner failed exhaust administrative remedies by filing [*7] a grievance after Respondent’s\nlocal grievance deadline. The Commissioner therefore has jurisdiction over this case.\n\nEven if the local grievance policy was a part of the administrative record, Respondent’s focus on the Contract as the\ntriggering event for Petitioner’s grievance is misplaced. Both parties agree that there is no written contract in this case\nbecause the Board failed to approve the Contract. The fact that Petitioner once signed a document that purported to be a\nprobationary contract when he was legally entitled to a term contract is irrelevant when no probationary contract\nagreement ever actually existed between the parties. Respondent did not violate the Texas Education Code by showing\nPetitioner a document purporting to be a probationary contract and allowing him to sign it. Instead, Respondent violated\nChapter 21 by failing to approve any contract at all for Petitioner. There is no evidence in the record that shows Petitioner\nknew or should have known before he filed his grievance that the Board had failed to approve his contract. Petitioner\ntherefore properly exhausted his administrative remedies at the local level.\n\nJurisdiction Without Written Contract\n\nRespondent [*8] relies heavily on Garza v. Jim Hogg County Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 001-R2-901 (Comm’r Educ.\n2002), to support its position that the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over this case because there was no written\ncontract. Garza involved a school superintendent who did not receive a written employment contract from the school\ndistrict, worked as a superintendent for most of the school year, and then was terminated without notice or hearing. Id. The\nCommissioner in Garza held that he did not have jurisdiction over the case under Texas Education Code section\n7.057(a)(2)(B), which gives the Commissioner jurisdiction over violations of written employment contracts between\nschool districts and school distict employees, because there was no written employment contract. Id. That same principle\napplies in this case--the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B)\nbecause there was no written employment contract between Petitioner and Respondent. The Commissioner does not have\nthe ability to interpret or enforce unwritten employment contracts, so the Commissioner cannot determine whether\nPetitioner was improperly terminated [*9] in this case. See, e.g., Cooper v. Paris Indep. Sch. Dist. Docket No. 83-R2-197\n(Comm’r Educ. 1997) (holding that when there was no written contract, the Commissioner could not enforce contract\ntermination requirements against a school district); see also, Hudson Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Lassiter, Docket No. 251-TTC-897\n(Comm’r Educ. 1998) (″Since there was no written contract between Petitioner and Respondent, the Commissioner cannot\ntake action against Respondent...for abandonment of contact.″). The Commissioner does not have jurisdiction under Texas\nEducation Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B) to determine or enforce termination rights for the unwritten contract Petitioner\nclaims in this case.\nHowever, Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A) provides entirely separate grounds for the Commissioner’s\njurisdiction: the actions or decision of a school board that violate the school laws of this state. In Garza, the Commissioner\nconsidered jurisdiction under section 7.057(a)(2)(A), but looked only to whether the school district had violated Texas\nEducation Code chapter 21, subchapter E by failing to follow the notice and hearing requirements for a term-contract\nemployee. The Commissioner [*10] found that the school district had not violated the term contract termination\nrequirements because there was no evidence that the superintendent in Garza had a term contract. Notably, the\nCommissioner did not consider or address in Garza whether the school district violated Texas Education Code section\n21.002--which requires that a school district employ each classroom teacher under a probationary, continuing, or term\ncontract--because that provision does not apply to superintendents. As this case does involve a classroom teacher, Texas\nEducation Code section 21.002 applies here, rendering Garza inapposite. More on point is Gonzalez v. Donna Indep. Sch.\nDist., Docket No. 074-R10-605 (Comm’r Educ. 2007), a case involving a classroom teacher where the Commissioner held:\n\n    While there may be no written contract, Petitioner has reported to work and Respondent has paid him. There is\n    a contract between Petitioner and Respondent. While the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction over this case based on\n    Texas Education Code section 7.057 (a)(2)(B) because there is no written contract, the Commissioner does have\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 4 of 6\n                                           2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *10\n\n    jurisdiction over this case based on Texas Education Code section 7.057 [*11] (a)(2)(A) because Petitioner alleges\n    violations of the school laws of this state.\n\nIn this case, the Commissioner has jurisdiction section 7.057(a)(2)(A) to determine whether Respondent violated Texas\nEducation Code section 21.002 by failing to employ Petitioner under a Chapter 21 contract.\n\nChapter 21 Contract\n\nRespondent’s failure to employ Petitioner under any of types of contracts listed in Texas Education Code section 21.002\nis a violation of the school laws of Texas. In its decision on Petitioner’s grievance, the Board held that Petitioner was an\nat-will employee because there was no executed written employment contract. The Board was wrong: the Commissioner\nhas previously held that a teacher employed by a school district to teach without a written contract cannot be an at-will\nemployee and must be given a Chapter 21 contract. Nield v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 024-R10-1110\n(Comm’r Educ. 2012). In failing to approve any Chapter 21 contract for Petitioner, the Board violated Texas Education\nCode section 21.002. As a result, the Board must approve a Chapter 21 contract for Petitioner.\n\nConclusion\n\nRespondent violated the school laws of Texas not when its [*12] superintendent gave Petitioner an unauthorized document\nlabeled ″Probationary Contract″ and allowed him to sign it, but rather when the Board failed to approve any valid Chapter\n21 contract to employ Petitioner as a teacher. Respondent’s local grievance policies were not included in the local record,\nso there is not substantial evidence to support Respondent’s argument that Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies by filing his grievance too late. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to show that Petitioner discovered\nbefore he filed his grievance that the Board had not approved his contract, so there is no evidence to dispute his assertion\nthat his grievance was timely. Respondent employed Petitioner as a classroom teacher, so Respondent was legally obligated\nto give Petitioner a Chapter 21 contract--classroom teachers cannot be at-will employees. Respondent must give Petitioner\na Chapter 21 contract for the 2012-2013 school year.\n\nExceptions\n\nBoth Petitioner and Respondent filed Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision. Petitioner excepted to a finding of fact that\nstated it was Respondent’s Superintendent that gave Petitioner the Contract, because the record [*13] shows it was a\nmember of Respondent’s Board, and requested that the Commissioner add additional Conclusions of Law regarding\nPetitioner’s contractual relationship with Respondent during the 2013-2014 school year. Respondent argued that the\nProposal for Decision inappropriately held that there was an oral contract in this case, set incorrect terms for that contract,\nand disregarded Respondent’s interpretation of its own grievance policy with regard to when Petitioner should have filed\na formal grievance.\n\nPetitioner is correct that Findings of Fact 4 and 5 incorrectly named the Superintendent as the person who gave Peitioner\nthe Contract. In fact, there is no evidence in the local record showing precisely which person associated with Respondent\ngave Petitioner the Contract. Petitioner cites the Board’s findings of fact in this case, but the findings of fact from\nRespondent’s Board cannot serve as evidence of the facts they describe. See, e.g., Chilton v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket\nNo. 031-R10-0107 (Comm’r Educ. 2009). The Findings of Fact have been amended accordingly.\n\nPetitioner is incorrect in asserting that the Commissioner should make Conclusions of Law regarding the contractual [*14]\nrelationship between Petitioner and Respondent during the 2013-2014 school year. There is no evidence in the local record\nto support findings beyond the 2012-2013 school year. Petitioner is welcome to pursue the grievance process with\nRespondent to develop a local record regarding the contractual relationship between Petitioner and Respondent during the\n2013-2014 school year in light of this decision, but that record is not currently before the Commissioner in this appeal. No\nother changes will be made in response to Petitioner’s Exceptions.\n\nWith regard to Respondent’s concerns about the oral contract, the question of whether an oral contract existed between\nthe parties is irrelevant to the fact that Respondent violated the Texas Education Code by failing to employ Petitioner under\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 5 of 6\n                                            2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *14\n\na written Chapter 21 contract. The Conclusion of Law on the existence of an oral contract has therefore been removed from\nthe Decision of the Commissioner. However, Respondent is incorrect that the Conclusions of Law, which state Petitioner\nis entitled to a term contract for the 2012-2013 school year and to be paid as a term contract employee was paid in\naccordance with Respondent’s policies during that [*15] period, are somehow setting the terms for a contract that never\nexisted. Rather, these Conclusions of Law merely require Respondent to fulfill its legal obligation under the Texas\nEducation Code to provide its teachers with Chapter 21 contracts and the benefits attendant thereto. The Commissioner has\nnot specified precisely what Petitioner should have been paid--only that it should be what a Chapter 21 contract employee\nin his position was due under Respondent’s policies for the 2012-2013 school year. In doing so, the Commissioner is not\ninterpreting an existing contract, but simply stating the impact of Respondent fulfilling the requirements of the Texas\nEducation Code. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, although Petitioner and Respondent agree that Petitioner\ncould only be employed under a term contract according to their mutual interpretation of Respondent’s policies and\nChapter 21, the Conclusions of Law have been amended to refer only to a Chapter 21 contract. No other changes to the\nProposal for Decision are necessary in response to Respondent’s Exceptions regarding the existence of Petitoner’s contract.\n\nRespondent also excepts to Finding of Fact 10, on the grounds [*16] that it incorrectly fails to defer to Respondent’s\ninterpretation of its own local grievance policy. As an initial matter, Respondent’s local grievance policy was not included\nin the local record for this case, and is therefore not properly before the Commissioner. Therefore, all references to specific\nrequirements under Respondent’s local grievance policy that appeared in the Proposal for Decision have been removed. The\ndiscussion of the grievance policy has been amended to hold that there is no substantial evidence in the record of what\nRespondent’s local grievance policy was. Without this evidence in the local record, Respondent cannot show that Petitioner\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies by missing the grievance deadline.\n\nBut regardless of what specific deadlines Respondent’s local grievance policy gave for filing a formal grievance, the parties\nagree that the operative question to determine if Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies is whether Petitioner\nknew or should have known about the cause of his grievance significantly before he filed the grievance. While Finding of\nFact 10 may have been unclearly worded, the Commissioner’s finding is that Petitioner [*17] did not have reason to know\nbefore he filed his grievance with Petitioner that the Board had failed to approve his contract, nullifying the contract. The\nwording of Finding of Fact 10 has been revised in an effort to make it clearer. Aside from those described above, no other\nchanges will be made to the Proposal for Decision in response to Respondent’s Exceptions.\n\nConclusions of Law\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing Findings of Fact, in my capacity as\nAdministrative Law Judge, I make the following Conclusions of Law:\n\n1. The Commissioner of Education has jurisdiction over this cause under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n\n2. Petitioner does not have a written contract with Respondent.\n\n3. Petitioner filed his grievance timely.\n\n4. Texas school districts cannot employ classroom teachers as at-will employees.\n\n5. The contractual requirements of Chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code are mandatory.\n\n6. Petitioner is entitled to a written Chapter 21 contract for the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n7. Petitioner is entitled to the amount of pay that he should have received for the written Chapter 21 contract had it existed\nduring the [*18] 2012-2013 school year under Texas Education Code section 21.402 and Respondent’s policies, less the\namount of pay that he has already received.\n\n8. Petitioner is entitled to accrue the Teachers Retirement System contributions that Respondent should have made for the\nwritten Chapter 21 contract had it existed during the 2012-2013 school year, less any contributions Respondent already\nmade for Petitioner.\n\f                                                                                                             Page 6 of 6\n                                         2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *18\n\n9. Petitioner’s appeal should be granted as specified. Any relief not explicitly granted should be denied.\n\nORDER\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw, in my capacity as the Commissioner of Education, it is hereby\n\nORDERED that the Petitioner’s appeal be, and is hereby, GRANTED, and\n\nFURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall reinstate Petitioner as if he had a written Chapter 21 contract for the\n2012-2013 school year, and pay all resulting back pay and benefits owed under such a contract in accordance with\nRespondent’s polices that has not already been paid to Petitioner.\n\nSIGNED AND ISSUED this 7th day of October, 2014.\n\f           APPENDIX 3\n\n\n\nMontgomery v.

Christopher Maska is the\nAdministrative Law Judge appointed by the Commissioner of Education. Petitioner is\nrepresented by Mark W. Robinett, Attorney at Law, Austin, Texas.                    Respondent is\nrepresented by Sandra Carpenter, Attorney at Law, Austin, Texas.\n        The Administrative Law Judge issued a Proposal for Decision recommending that\nPetitioner’s appeal be dismissed in part and denied in part.\n                                         Findings of Fact\n        After due consideration of the record and matters officially noticed, it is\nconcluded that the following Findings of Fact are supported by substantial evidence and\n\nare the Findings of Fact that best support Respondent’s decision1.\n        1.      Petitioner was employed by Respondent under a term contract for the\n2007-2008 school year. Most of the terms of this contract are not in the local record.\nPetitioner was employed by Respondent as an elementary school principal for the 2007-\n2008 school year.\n        2.      Petitioner was employed by Respondent under a term contract for the\n2008-2009 school. The terms of this contract are in the local record. The contract is\n\n1\n See 19 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 157.1073(h); Bosworth v. East Central Independent School District, Docket\nNo. 090-R1-803 (Comm’r Educ. 2003).\n\n\n007-R10-1008\n\f“For Professional Administrator.” Petitioner was employed as a Program Specialist II\nfor the 2008-2009 school year.\n       3.       Petitioner was assigned to work the same number of days and was\nscheduled to receive the same compensation for the 2008-2009 school year as Petitioner\nreceived for the 2007-2008 school year.\n       4.       As a Program Specialist II, Petitioner reports to the Director of\nProfessional Development. Petitioner’s general responsibilities concern all new teachers\nand district-wide professional development.            Petitioner’s specific duties and\nresponsibilities as a Program Specialist II are unclear from the record.\n                                        Discussion\n       Petitioner contends that Respondent changed her professional capacity when it\nreassigned her from the position of Elementary Magnet School Principal to the position\nof Program Specialist II. In particular, Petitioner maintains that the position of a campus\nprincipal is a distinct professional capacity.     Petitioner also contends that she was\ndemoted. Respondent denies Petitioner’s claims.\nDemotion\n       The Texas Education Code does not prohibit a school district from demoting a\nteacher. Petitioner has not alleged that any section or sections of the Texas Education\n\nCode prohibit demotions.       To the extent the Commissioner has jurisdiction over\ndemotions, that authority must come from Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B)\nwhich gives the Commissioner jurisdiction over violations of written employment\ncontracts that cause or would cause monetary harm. Because Petitioner has not lost\nsalary or benefits Petitioner cannot show the requisite monetary harm. Smith v. Nelson,\n53 S.W.3d 792 (Tex. App.-Austin 2001, pet denied).              The Commissioner lacks\njurisdiction over Petitioner’s demotion claim.\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                2\n\fSame Professional Capacity\n         A “teacher2” who holds a term contract under Texas Education Code chapter 21,\nsubchapter E that is about to expire cannot be reassigned to a new position for the next\nschool year unless the position is within the same professional capacity as the position the\n“teacher” held in the current school year:\n\n\n         (a)ANot later than the 45th day before the last day of instruction in a school year,\n         the board of trustees shall notify in writing each teacher whose contract is about to\n         expire whether the board proposes to renew or not renew the contract.\n         (b)    the board’s failure to give the notice required by Subsection (a) within the\n         time specified constitutes an election to employ the teacher in the same\n         professional capacity for the following school year.\nTEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206. The term “same professional capacity” is not defined in the\nTexas Education Code.            However, the Commissioner from the earliest substantive\ndecision concerning this provision has held that “administrator” is a professional\ncapacity.\n\n\n         It is more reasonable to conclude that the legislature, by using the term “same\n         professional capacity” (instead of “exact same position”), intended to allow\n         school districts to be flexible in their personnel assignments while discouraging\n         the abuse of the district’s inherent or contractual authority. In other words, the\n         district may place a teacher whose employment has been renewed by operation of\n         law in a position different from that to which the teacher was assigned the\n         previous year, as long as the position is one to which the district could have\n         reassigned the teacher had the parties voluntarily entered into a contract for the\n         following year. In some instances the validity of a particular placement will be\n         clear. For example, an administrator who does not receive the required notice by\n         April 13 may not be placed in the capacity of a classroom teacher. . .\n                  In other instances, the validity of a particular placement might not be so\n         clear. For example, a placement might be to another position within the same\n         professional category (e.g., administrator), but nevertheless be invalid (e.g., from\n         superintendent to assistant elementary school principal). Factors to be considered\n\n\n2\n  The definition of “teacher” found at Texas Education Code section 21.201 is truly a creature of statute. It\nincludes individuals who would never in common speech be referred to as teachers.\n3\n  In the original Term Contract Nonrenewal Act, a district had to propose nonrenewal on or before April 1,\ninstead of the current requirement of “the 45th day before the last day of instruction.” Term Contract\nNonrenewal Act, 67th Leg., R.S. , ch. 765, § 2, 1981 Tex. Gen Laws 2847.\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                         3\n\f        in determining the validity of such an assignment include, but are not limited to\n        differences in authority, duties, and salary.\nBarich v. San Felipe-Del Rio Consolidated Independent School District, Docket No. 117-\nR1a-484 (Comm’r Educ. 1985).                Further, the Commissioner has found that the\nprofessional capacity of “administrator” is to be broadly interpreted:\n       It is possible to imagine situations where the transfer clause of an employment\n       contract would be held to be unenforceable under § 21.204(b) 4. However, this is\n       not such a case. It has been the consistent view of the Commissioner that the\n       TCNA balanced its grant of limited tenure rights against the considerable\n       personnel management problems it might cause if imposed inflexibly. Districts\n       have responded to this law by creating broad classes within which transfers do not\n       implicate the TCNA. If taken to extremes, this tactic would be against public\n       policy as expressed in the TCNA, but I cannot make such a finding in this case.\n       The need for flexibility in making personnel changes is strongest, and the\n       argument for a rigid tenure system weakest, at the administrative level. In short, I\n       find the generic “administrator” position before me consistent with the policies of\n       the TCNA.\nCarpenter v. Wichita Falls Independent School District, Docket No. 247-R3-491\n(Comm’r Educ. 1993).           In many cases, it will not constitute a violation of Texas\nEducation Code section 21.206, for a district to reassign a term contract administrator\nfrom a position with one administrative job title to a position that has a different\nadministrative job title.\n        As Carpenter indicates, what professional capacity a “teacher” holds is to a\ncertain extent determined by the employment contract.                  However, districts are not\ncompletely free to determine what professional capacity a “teacher” has. A professional\ncapacity must be a legitimate professional capacity.               Young v. Leggett Independent\nSchool District, Docket No. 175-R3-898 (Comm’r Educ. 1999). Petitioner’s 2007-2008\ncontract is not in the record and there is not evidence in the record as to what Petitioner’s\n2007-2008 contract said as to the issue of Petitioner’s professional capacity. Assuming\nthat Petitioner’s 2007-2008 contract5 was for the professional capacity of administrator,\nthis professional capacity encompasses principals. A district is not required to employee\n4\n  The old Texas Education Code section 21.204 is the predecessor of the current Texas Education Code\nsection 21.206.\n5\n  Petitioner’s 2008-2009contract is entitled “For Professional Administrator.”\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                      4\n\fa principal in the professional capacity of principal. A district may employee a principal\nin the professional capacity of administrator. To determine if a district may reassign an\nadministrator, who is employed as a principal, to another position, the two positions need\nto be compared.\nPrincipal and Program Specialist II\n       Applying the factors noted in Barich is difficult in this case because the record is\nsparse as to issues of differences in authority, duties, and salary.       While Petitioner\ncontends that there is a significant difference in salary between her former principal\nposition and the compensation that the salary schedules assigns to a Program Specialist\nII, Petitioner makes no citation to the record for this claim and the local record appears to\nlack such information. The record does indicate that for the 2008-2009 school year,\nPetitioner will retain the same salary and work days as Petitioner did for the previous\nschool year. Local Record, Tab 3.\nAuthority and Duties\n       As to the comparison of authority and duties, Petitioner in her brief, after making\ncitations to the Texas Education Code concerning the duties of principals, states:\n                There are no like provisions detailing the legislature’s expectations and\n        demands of Program Specialists-whether category I, II, III, or MMIX. The only\n        thing that can be said with certainly about Program Specialist is that they are not\n        like principals in any meaningful way, shape, or form. Instead the position of\n        Program Specialist II is a subordinate position at the Professional Development\n        Center that contains no duties, responsibilities, or authority over the district’s\n        students.\nIt is true that the Texas Education Code does not detail duties or expectations for\nProgram Specialists. As for the other claims, Petitioner fails to make citations to the\nrecord. However, it is true that as a Program Specialist II Petitioner reports to the\nDirector of Professional Development. Local Record, Tab 3. Petitioner is correct that\n\nher new position does not give her authority over students.          Local Record, Tab 7\nattachment. It gives Petitioner responsibilities concerning all new teachers and district-\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                5\n\fwide professional development. This is known from the job discretion for Professional\nDevelopment Specialist that is the record. It is a general description. Petitioner was told\nby the Director of Professional Development what her specific responsibilities were to be\nbut the more specific description is not in local record. The record fails to provide a clear\npicture of Petitioner’s duties and responsibilities in her new job.        As the grievant,\nPetitioner had the burden of proof before the board of trustees. Applying the Barich\nstandards, a reasonable finder of fact could have concluded that Petitioner failed to meet\nher burden of proof that the two positions at issue are not in the same professional\ncapacity. There is substantial evidence to support the denial of Petitioner’s grievance.\nConclusion\n       Respondent did not violate Texas Education Code section 21.206, when it\nreassigned Petitioner.\n                                    Conclusions of Law\n       After due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing\nFindings of Fact, in my capacity as Commissioner of Education, I make the following\nConclusions of Law:\n       1.       The Commissioner has jurisdiction to over Petitioner’s Texas Education\nCode section 21.206 claim under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n\n       2.       The Commissioner lacks jurisdiction over Petitioner’s demotion claim.\nTEX. EDUC. CODE § 7.057(a)(2)(B).\n       3.       The Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over demotion claims based\non Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n       4.       The Commissioner may have jurisdiction over a demotion claim if a\nviolation of a written employment contract is alleged that causes or would cause\nmonetary harm. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 7.057(a)(2)(B).\n       5.       The monetary harm referred to in Texas Education Code section\n7.057(a)(2)(B) must be a contract damage. If an employee does not lose salary or\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                6\n\fbenefits based on an alleged violation of a written contract, the employee has not suffered\nmonetary harm.\n       6.       Because Petitioner did not suffer monetary harm as that term is used in\nTexas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B), the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction over\nPetitioner’s demotion claim.\n       7.       Administrator is a professional capacity as that term is used in Texas\nEducation Code section 21.206(b).\n       8.       The professional capacity of administrator, as it applies to Texas\nEducation Code section 21.206(b), is a broad professional capacity.\n       9.       A “teacher” who is employed as a principal may be employed in the\nprofessional capacity of administrator. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206(b).\n       10.      To determine whether two positions are in the same professional capacity,\na comparison should be made of any differences in authority, duties, and salary, along\nwith any other relevant factors. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206(b).\n       11.      A grievant has the burden of proof before a school board.\n       12.      As this case is an appeal of a school district’s decision, the substantial\nevidence standard applies. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 7.057(c).\n       13.      There is substantial evidence to support Respondent’s determination that\n\nthe two positions at issue that Petitioner held are not in different professional capacities.\nTEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206(b).\n       14.      Respondent did not violate Texas Education Code section 21.206(b) when\nit reassigned Petitioner from the position of elementary principal to the position of\nProgram Specialist II.\n       15.      The Petition for Review should be dismissed in part and denied in part.\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                7\n\f                                                 Order\n        After due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed and the foregoing\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in my capacity as Commissioner of Education,\nit is hereby\n        ORDERED that Petitioner’s appeal be, dismissed in part and denied in part.\n        SIGNED AND ISSUED this ______ day of _______________________, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                      ______________________________________\n                                      ROBERT SCOTT\n                                      COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                8\n\f             APPENDIX 4\n\nTitle 19 Tex.

Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 4\n\f                                 REPLY POINT ONE\n\n       Jenkins’ contract should have been repaired to her benefit, not to\n       the benefit of the CISD.\n\n       This issue is separate from the §§21.201 and 21.206 arguments in this case.\n\nThis Court could rule that Jenkins’ ambiguous contract was for “principal,”\n\nwithout confronting the statutory issues. Neither appellee responded to Jenkins\n\narguments regarding Texas Education Code §21.002(a), which says:\n\n       A school district shall employ each classroom teacher, principal,\n       librarian, nurse, or school counselor under … a term contract, as\n       provided by Subchapter E.\n\n(emphasis added) (Jenkins’ brief p. 27) A principal is entitled to a contract. An\n\n“administrator” is not statutorily entitled to a contract, though the school board\n\nmay offer contracts to whomever it chooses. As a generic administrator, Jenkins\n\nhas lost the benefit and protection of this statute without receiving any quasi-due-\n\nprocess protection guaranteed by Texas Education Code Chapter 21.\n\n       The commissioner’s brief muddies the contract analysis by enunciating a\n\nnew test: If the contract position is ambiguous, the boilerplate reassignment clause\n\nin the contract and the superintendent’s authority gives the district the unrestrained\n\nright to reassign, as long as the employee is certified in the new position. (Comm’r\n\nbrief, p. 32) Since every principal is certified to be an assistant principal, but also\n\ncertified to teach, this is obviously problematic, and not such a workable solution.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 5\n\fSee Title 19 Tex. Admin. Code §241.20 (3). Likewise, both appellees rely on the\n\nboilerplate language of the contract that says the employee is subject to\n\nreassignment into any position the employee is certified or qualified to perform.\n\n(CISD brief p. 30)        If contract language controlled, an employee could be\n\nreassigned to any position.\n\n       The CISD and commissioner never acknowledge in their briefs that §21.206\n\nhas always tempered the reassignment clause of a school employment contract. No\n\nmatter the contract language, an employee to whom §21.206 applies may not be\n\nreassigned outside of her “professional capacity.” Similarly, a superintendent’s\n\nstatutory authority does not extend to reassigning an employee to whom §21.206\n\napplies outside of her professional capacity. The CISD and commissioner cannot\n\nseriously dispute this legal restriction on reassignments.\n\n       Nor does either appellee respond to or dispute that the ambiguous,\n\nboilerplate contract should be construed against the school district author, as\n\nJenkins argued in her brief. (Jenkins’ brief p. 28) With respect to the parties’\n\nintentions, Ms. Jenkins certainly believed she signed a contract to be principal for\n\nthe 2011-13 school years, as she told the school board in October 2011 at her\n\ngrievance hearing:\n\n       On June 28, months after I signed a new two-year contract to lead\n       Drew Intermediate School as principal for the 2011/13 school year, Dr.\n       Moore removed me as principal and reassigned me to an A.P. at C.H.S.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v.

Finally, the reassignment provision in the contract referred\n\nto by the commissioner and CISD is still effective:               Jenkins can indeed be\n\nreassigned as principal of another campus in the district.\n\n                                 REPLY POINT TWO\n\n       The commissioner’s ruling contradicts the plain language of\n       §§21.201 and 21.206.

The commissioner has already opined that superintendents, teachers,\n\ncounselors, librarians, nurses are entitled to these rights as they are each listed in\n\n§21.201. This case only addresses the position of “principal,” the only specific\n\nposition in §21.201 that is omitted from the commissioner’s consideration in\n\n§21.206.\n\n        When a teacher signs his contract in the spring, he knows he will be a\n\nteacher in the fall. He might teach at a different campus, or teach a different grade\n\nor subject; but he will be a teacher. When a nurse signs her contract in the spring,\n\nshe knows she will be a nurse in the fall, subject to a geographical reassignment.\n\nThe same is true for a librarian, counselor and superintendent. Regardless of\n\ncontract language or the superintendent’s authority, §21.206 guarantees this and\n\nappellees do not dispute it.\n\n        A principal must be employed under a written contract, whereas a generic\n\nadministrator has no such guarantee. Tex. Educ. Code §21.002.                  But when a\n\nprincipal signs her contract in the spring, she is immediately at risk of losing this\n\nlegal right and the benefit of her bargain because she is considered to be a generic\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v.

She might be something as vague as “program specialist II”\n\nwhich may or may not be a certified position; may or may not be a contract\n\nposition; and which has no definition in law. See Montgomery v. Richardson\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., TEA Docket No. 007-R10-1008 (Comm’r Educ. 2012) (Appx. 3,\n\naffirming reassignment from principal to “program specialist II.”)                   Jenkins\n\ncertainly lost the benefit of her bargain when she signed a contract as middle\n\nschool principal in the spring of 2011, and returned to school in the fall as one of\n\nfour high school assistant principals.\n\n       The commissioner says the Texas Education Code mentions administrator\n\nmultiple times outside of Chapter 21, Subchapter E. (Comm’r brief, pp. 8-10)\n\nThere is no need go outside Texas Education Code Chapter 21, Subchapter E\n\nwhere the introductory phrase of §21.201 says, “In this subchapter ‘teacher’ means\n\n… principal ...”      But if one ventures outside of Chapter 21, Subchapter E,\n\nadministrator is more conspicuous by its absence. According to Tex. Educ. Code\n\n§21.002, a principal is entitled to a contract, but an “administrator” is not. Neither\n\nis a “program specialist II.” By reassigning a principal into a generic administrator\n\nposition such as assistant principal, a school district can remove a principal from\n\nher contract without any quasi-due-process protections guaranteed by law.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 9\n\f       Appellees mischaracterize Jenkins’ case as one questioning the legitimacy of\n\nthe administrator capacity. Of course, administrators exist in fact and in law. But\n\nit is a term even the commissioner of education has described as “generic.”\n\nCarpenter v. Wichita Falls Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 0247-R3-491 (Tex.\n\nComm’r Educ. 1993) (Jenkins’ brief, Appx. 8). Principal, by its distinct and\n\nspecialized treatment in the law, is a specialized subset of administrator.\n\n       Proving Jenkins’ point, the commissioner reminds us that state law\n\npreviously heaped all administrators together for evaluation purposes, but now has\n\nsegregated principal evaluations from all other administrator evaluations.\n\n(commissioners brief p. 9, citing Tex. Educ Code §§21.354 and 21.3541.)\n\nMoreover, the TEA regulations in place before and after the facts of this case\n\nrefine the administrator evaluation process and distinguish between superintendent,\n\nprincipal, and all other administrators. (Title 19 Tex. Admin. Code §§150.1021;\n\n150.1022) (Appx. 4)\n\n       Amicus TASB claims that administrator is defined in state regulations as\n\nspecifically including principals and assistant principals. (TASB brief, p. 18, citing\n\n19 Tex. Admin. Code Chap. 229.) This is misleading. The TASB citation is to a\n\nvery specific regulation regarding data collection for educator preparation\n\nprograms and has nothing to do with contract reassignments. The full definition,\n\nwhich TASB omits, says an administrator is, “For purposes of the surveys and\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v.

Admin. Code. §229.3 for a variety of\n\nexamples: “… school principals and administrators … shall provide … data and\n\ninformation required by this chapter; “the school administrator and principal …”;\n\n“Principals or designated administrators ….”) (Appx. 4, emphases added) This\n\nfurther demonstrates that a principal is not a generic administrator, because it is\n\ndistinguished in the law.\n\n       The commissioner has confused “administrator” with “supervisor.” Section\n\n21.201 does not use “administrator,” though it does use “supervisor.” The Texas\n\nEducation Code distinguishes between principal and a generic supervisor\n\n(emphases and brackets added on the following):\n\n   • Section 7.064(a).AThe commissioner shall develop an online survey\n     to be administered statewide at least biennially to superintendents,\n     principals, supervisors, classroom teachers, counselors, and other\n     appropriate full-time professional employees who are required to hold\n     a certificate issued under Subchapter B, Chapter 21.\n\n   • Sections 21.101(1) and 21.201(1): “Teacher” means a superintendent,\n     principal, supervisor, classroom teacher, counselor, or other full-time\n     professional employee who is required to hold a certificate issued\n     under Subchapter B, or a nurse.

(See Tex. Educ. Code §§21.003 requiring the\n\ncertification of all administrators; See §21.355 rendering all administrator\n\nevaluations confidential.)\n\n\n                                REPLY POINT THREE\n\n       Appellees exaggerate the effects of Jenkins’ case. This case would\n       not overturn decades of precedent. The legislature has not\n       acquiesced in the commissioner’s decision.\n\n       Crosby ISD mischaracterizes Jenkins case as “once a principal, always a\n\nprincipal.” (CISD brief pp. 11; 32-33) To be clear, Jenkins desires quasi-due-\n\nprocess protections guaranteed to her by law before she is reassigned outside of her\n\nprofessional capacity, as required by §21.206.           She is not entitled to tenure as\n\nprincipal, nor has she argued this.\n\n       Appellees posit that adding principal to the list of professional capacities in\n\n§21.206 would overturn 30 years of precedent. The commissioner told the Court\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 12\n\fbelow that he, “has repeatedly held that a principal and assistant principal are in the\n\nsame professional capacity … The Court should not overturn nearly 30 years of\n\nprecedent.” (Clerk’s record p. 239; commissioner’s trial brief, p. 9) The CISD\n\ntold the Court below that “… the Commissioner has issued a number of decisions\n\nfinding that a principal was appropriately reassigned to an assistant principal\n\nposition …” (Clerk’s record p. 284; CISD trial brief p. 16)\n\n       Both appellees greatly mischaracterize the commissioner’s jurisprudence. In\n\nreality, prior to Jenkins filing her case with the commissioner in 2011, the\n\ncommissioner had issued only one decision which specifically addressed a\n\nprincipal to assistant principal reassignment. Pasqua v. Fort Stockton Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., TEA Docket No. 011-R3-1102 (Comm’r Educ. 2002) (CISD brief, Tab 7).\n\nIn that case, the principal argued that his reassignment to assistant principal\n\nviolated due process, the district’s duty of good faith and fair dealing, the Open\n\nMeetings Act, and was constructive discharge. Pasqua provides no analysis of\n\n§§21.201 and 21.206, or “same professional capacity.” Further, in Pasqua no\n\nclaim was made about an ambiguous job title in the contract, as in the case at bar.\n\n       In another case previous to Jenkins, the commissioner approved a\n\nreassignment of a principal to another principal position. Underwood v. West Rusk\n\nCo. Consolid. Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 062-R3-198 (Comm’r Educ. 1998)\n\n(CISD brief Tab 8) The commissioner erroneously states that Underwood is a\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 13\n\fprincipal to assistant principal reassignment. (“There, like here, a middle school\n\nprincipal was reassigned to be a high school assistant principal.”) (Comm’r brief,\n\np. 16)    While the reassignment in that case was initially broad, it was from\n\nprincipal of two grades to principal of three grades. (“Petitioner is expected to\n\nfunction as principal to seventh, eighth and ninth grade students instead of seventh\n\nand eighth grades only.” Underwood, p. 3, CISD brief Tab 8) The principal in\n\nUnderwood attempted to preserve the “same exact position,” which Chapter 21\n\ndoes not protect, clearly distinguishing it from the case at bar.\n\n       Although Barich is 30 years old, Jenkins’ case is one of first impression\n\nchallenging a principal to assistant principal reassignment via §21.206. All other\n\nprincipal to assistant principal cases cited by appellees post-date Jenkins’ case.\n\n       Further undercutting appellees’ legislative acquiescence argument is that\n\nJenkins’ argument comports with the commissioner’s rationale. In 30 years, the\n\ncommissioner has recognized every specific position in §21.201 - superintendent,\n\nteacher, school counselor, librarian, and nurse - as a professional capacity.\n\nJenkins’ argument merely extends this natural trajectory to include principals, the\n\nonly specific position omitted from consideration. Moreover, she does not argue\n\nagainst the validity of the generic “administrator” professional capacity, only that it\n\nshould not apply to a principal and should not be inserted into her ambiguous\n\ncontract. This Court could narrowly decide that “principal” is a “professional\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 14\n\fcapacity,” leaving intact for another day the mystery of the commissioner’s view\n\nthat the positions in §21.201 “may or may not be professional capacities” in\n\n§21.206. Jenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ. Agency Docket No. 043-\n\nR10-1211 (Comm’r Educ. 2013) (Jenkins’ brief Appx. 1, p. 24).\n\n                                REPLY POINT FOUR\n\n       Appellees misstate facts regarding Jenkins’ duties as a high school\n       assistant principal and whether Jenkins waived the Barich issue.\n\n       Here, for the purposes of comparing her principal to assistant principal\n\nduties, Crosby ISD recites at length Jenkins’ alleged, new duties as a high school\n\nassistant principal. (CISD brief p. 3) The commissioner joins with CISD in\n\nreciting Jenkins’ specific assistant principal duties, and does so by breaking them\n\ninto bullet points. (Comm’r brief pp. 2-3) But both citations directly contradict the\n\ncommissioner’s decision in this case, where he found, “The local record does not\n\nindicate with specificity what Petitioner’s duties as assistant principal … are”\n\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ. Agency Docket No. 043-R10-1211\n\n(Comm’r Educ. 2013) (Jenkins’ brief Appx. 1, p. 2, finding of fact 4). Crosby ISD\n\nnever objected to this finding and it is too late now. The commissioner’s brief is\n\ndirectly at odds with the commissioner’s decision.\n\n       The source used by both appellees is the superintendent’s September 16,\n\n2011 level-two grievance decision he issued to Ms. Jenkins. (R. pp. 284-286) Not\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 15\n\fcoincidentally, Jenkins had never been given the legalistic set of assistant principal\n\nduties until she filed the grievance, the CISD hired lawyers, and the superintendent\n\nissued his level two decision.\n\n       The commissioner has held that a grievance decision cannot be construed as\n\nfact. “A level II decision is a decision by a finder of fact, it is not evidence of the\n\nfact findings contained therein.” Chilton v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ.\n\nAgency Docket No. 031-R10-0107 (Comm’r Educ. 2009) (Appx. 1, Conclusion of\n\nLaw 9) In another case, the issue was whether the teacher had timely filed the\n\ngrievance. The commissioner said, “Although [the school district’s] decisions on\n\n[the teacher’s] grievance reference the [grievance] policy requirements, the policy\n\nitself is absent from the local record,” concluding that he could not make the\n\ndetermination from statements made within the district’s grievance decision.\n\nHigereda v. Valley View Indep. Sch. Dist., TEA Docket No. 027-R10-12-2013\n\n(Comm’r Educ. 2014) (Appx. 2, p. 3, brackets added for clarity).\n\n       Accordingly, the superintendent’s level-two decision cannot be construed as\n\nevidence. The only evidence comes from the CISD job descriptions, which the\n\ncommissioner improperly ignored, and from the law.                  The meaningless job\n\ndescription for principal says, “The person chosen should be bright, experienced,\n\nand capable of working with a staff having the same capabilities.” (R. 292) While\n\nthis job description is lacking, state law describes a principal’s job in great detail.\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 16\n\fThe equally vague, CISD assistant principal job description says, “Provide students\n\nwith the appropriate learning activities and experience designed to fulfill their\n\npotential for intellectual, emotional, physical and social growth.” (R. 293) While\n\nnot a model of clarity, it is some evidence of Jenkins’ duties as assistant principal.\n\n       Appellees now say that Jenkins waived a factual comparison of her job\n\nduties, thereby waiving the Barich issue. Barich v. San Felipe-Del Rio Cons.\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., Tex. Educ. Agency Docket No. 117-R1a-484 (Comm’r Educ.\n\n1985) (CISD brief, pp. 28-29) In its brief, Crosby ISD says:\n\n       At no time, nor in any grievance hearing, did Jenkins argue that the\n       duties outlined for her current assistant principal position were untrue,\n       inaccurate or needed further clarification. Nor did Jenkins claim that\n       her principal duties … were different than her … duties as an\n       assistant principal…”\n\n(CISD brief, pp. 2-3) Although the commissioner has never before held that\n\nBarich only applies to a factual comparison of the jobs, here is what Jenkins’\n\nlawyer told the school board at her October 2011, level-three grievance meeting:\n\n       We asked for the job descriptions in this district for principal and\n       assistant principal because we wanted to compare them … These\n       …[were] given to us as job descriptions for principal and assistant\n       principal ... There's not much there in the way of a description, but\n       they're certainly different.\n\n(R. 259, hearing transcript p. 14, emphasis and brackets added for clarity) The job\n\ndescriptions leave little to analyze, but they amount to some evidence. Because the\n\nCISD job descriptions were inadequate, Jenkins argued more forcefully that the\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 17\n\fprincipal’s duties defined by law prove the jobs are substantially dissimilar.\n\nProving her point, the CISD sought to define her assistant principal duties in a\n\nlevel-two grievance decision, and could change them at any time. However, state\n\nlaw restricts the school district’s authority to amend a principal’s duties.\n\n     Because Jenkins focused on the legal differences between the two jobs, on\n\nappeal to the Texas Education Agency, the commissioner found sua sponte that\n\nJenkins waived the Barich issue. The commissioner said Jenkins failed to argue\n\nthat her duties as principal factually differed from her assistant principal duties.\n\nThe commissioner repeats this here:\n\n       Her petition for review did not claim that her reassignment was\n       inappropriate because the two jobs at issue were actually dissimilar.\n       Nor did her briefing raise the claim that the two jobs at issue were\n       actually dissimilar.\n\n(Comm’r brief pp. 27-28)         In her petition for review at the Texas Education\n\nAgency (TEA), Jenkins pled: “The duties of Principal and Assistant Principal are\n\nnot within the same professional capacity … The position of campus principal is\n\n… a unique position defined by state law, and is unlike any other school employee\n\nposition.” (R. 157, emphasis added). In her brief at the TEA, Jenkins argued:\n\n       Barich had no evidence comparing the positions. Here, Jenkins’s\n       evidence reflects a stark difference between principal and assistant\n       principal.\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 18\n\f(R. 142, fn 4, emphasis added) The last sentence in Jenkins’ TEA brief said: “As\n\nprincipal, Jenkins was the instructional leader, and she supervised an entire campus\n\nstaff. As assistant principal, she only operates in a supporting role.” (R. 152)\n\nFinally, at the same October 2011 school board hearing, Ms. Jenkins personally\n\ntold the school board:\n\n       There are five administrators on the high school campus, four of those\n       positions are A.P.s; and I will have no more authority than any of the\n       other A.P.s to turn the school around. The campus is led by the\n       principal, and the role of an A.P. is to follow that lead.\n\n(R. 260, hearing transcript p. 21, brackets added)\n\n       Amicus TASB asserts that “many principals consider an assistant principal\n\nposition at the high school to be a professionally advantageous move from …\n\nelementary or intermediate/middle school ... Additionally, such principals view this\n\n… as a logical professional ‘stepping stone,’ …” (TASB brief, p. 33) There are\n\ntwo reasons why this is either incorrect or irrelevant:\n\n   1. For those principals who desire a reassignment to assistant principal, it will\n\n       be by agreement. This case will have no impact on those principals.\n\n   2. A demotion is in the eyes of the beholder, and unlike amicus Texas\n\n       Elementary Principals and Supervisors Association, TASB does not\n\n       represent the views of administrators.\n\nEarlier in her career at CISD, Jenkins had already served as a Crosby High School\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v.

In fact, it was my performance as an A.P. at\n\nC.H.S. [Crosby High School] that resulted in my promotion to principal in 2003.”\n\n(R. 260, hearing transcript p. 21, brackets added) A return to CHS as assistant\n\nprincipal is not an agreed promotion, but rather an assignment outside of Jenkins’\n\nprofessional capacity.\n\n       In sum, Jenkins placed the job descriptions into evidence, specifically\n\nargued to the school board that the two jobs were different, factually and legally;\n\nand specifically argued at the TEA that her evidence - the job descriptions and the\n\nlaw - was more compelling than the evidence in the Barich case. Jenkins did not\n\nwaive the Barich issue.\n\n                                 REPLY POINT FIVE\n\n       Crosby ISD’s argument that Jenkins’ claim “does not involve an\n       expiring contract” thus rendering §21.206 inapplicable, is without\n       merit and has been waived by CISD.\n\n       In its first argument, CISD says that same professional capacity “is triggered\n\nwhen a term contract is about to expire and the board of trustees fails to give\n\ntimely notice of a proposed nonrenewal.” (CISD brief p. 10) Crosby ISD then\n\nstates, “Here, Jenkins received timely and appropriate notice…” (CISD brief p. 10)\n\nThis is a confusing and inaccurate statement. Jenkins’ case exists because she did\n\nnot receive a notice of proposed nonrenewal, thus depriving her of a quasi-due-\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 20\n\fprocess opportunity to defend against the reassignment. Had she received “timely\n\nand appropriate notice,” she would have no §21.206 case.\n\n       Further, CISD says that Jenkins’ claim is not ripe because Jenkins’ brought\n\nher claim “during the term of [her] new contract.” (CISD brief p.10) That is also\n\nan inaccurate statement of law and fact. Jenkins’ contract in question covers the\n\n2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. (R. 294, Jenkins’ brief Appx. 5) Jenkins\n\nsigned the contract on March 2, 2011, but the contract was not effective until\n\nAugust 2011, at the beginning of the 2011-12 school year. (R. 294, Jenkins’ brief\n\nAppx. 5) On June 28, 2011, between the time she signed the contact and the time\n\nthe contract was became effective, she was given notice of reassignment. Her\n\nreassignment was not effective until August 1, 2011, as evidenced by the\n\nsuperintendent’s letter. (R. 291)\n\n       Indeed, CISD concedes in its brief that Jenkins could have resigned penalty-\n\nfree until July 8, 2011. (CISD brief, p. 2) The penalty-free resignation date is 45\n\ndays before the first day of student instruction, which in this case was August 23,\n\n2011. (Tex. Educ. Code §21.210) Thus, Jenkins reassignment occurred between\n\nher contracts and before the 2011-12 school year started.\n\n       On this point, the commissioner is correct:\n\n       Petitioner's claim concerning Texas Education Code section 21.206\n       would not appear to be ripe. However, Petitioner points out that she\n       was employed by Respondent as a principal just prior to her signing\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 21\n\f       her 2011-2013 contract. Hence, during the 2011-2012 school year,\n       Respondent was required to employ Petitioner in the same\n       professional capacity as Petitioner held during the 2010-2011 school\n       year.\n\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist., TEA Docket No. 043-R10-1211 (Comm’r\n\nEduc. 2013, p. 5) (emphasis added).\n\n       For the first time in this litigation, Crosby ISD says the commissioner was\n\n“erroneous and should be reversed …” (CISD brief, p. 13) But Crosby ISD failed\n\nto brief this issue before the commissioner, and failed to file exceptions to the\n\nproposal for decision issued by the commissioner’s administrative law judge which\n\ncontained the same language set out above. (R. 36) “All disagreements with the\n\nfactual findings and legal conclusions of the proposal for decision must be made in\n\nthe parties’ exceptions to the proposal for decision or be waived.” Title 19 Tex.\n\nAdmin. Code §157.1059(d). Crosby ISD also failed to file a motion for rehearing,\n\nwhich is a prerequisite to a judicial appeal.             Title 19 Tex. Admin. Code\n\n§157.1061(a).\n\n       Further, CISD claims that Jenkins should have pled “demotion” instead of a\n\nviolation of §21.206. (CISD brief, p. 3, p. 11) Whether Jenkins could have filed a\n\nfederal case for a constitutional due process demotion or for discriminatory\n\ndemotion, has no bearing on the analysis here. Since 1995, the commissioner does\n\nnot have jurisdiction over a “demotion” case.              The commissioner only has\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v. Crosby Indep. Sch. Dist. - Case No. 03-15-00313-CV\nAppellant’s Reply Brief\nPage 22\n\fjurisdiction over a violation of the school laws of the state or a violation of a\n\nwritten employment contract. Tex. Educ. Code §7.057(a). Crosby ISD’s argument\n\nis without merit and has been waived.\n\n\n\n                                PRAYER FOR RELIEF\n\n       Jenkins respectfully requests that she be granted the following relief:\n\n       A.     That this Court reverse the trial court and the decision of the\n\ncommissioner and render for Jenkins;\n\n       B.     That this Court finds that CISD breached Jenkins’ contract and/or\n\nviolated Jenkins’ statutory rights;\n\n       C.     That this Court order CISD to immediately reinstate Jenkins to her\n\nformer position as principal;\n\n       D.     That Jenkins be awarded such other and further relief to which she\n\nmay show herself to be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\nJenkins v.

Petitioner is represented by Julie D. Leahy, Attorney at Law, Austin, Texas. Respondent\nis represented by Clay Grover, Attorney at Law, Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge issued a Proposal for Decision recommending that Petitioner’s appeal\nbe granted. Exceptions and replies were timely filed and considered.\n\nFindings of Fact\n\nAfter due consideration of the record and matters officially noticed, it is concluded that the following\nFindings of Fact are established applying the substantial evidence standard.\n\n1. In response to Petitioner’s grievance, Respondent’s board of trustees voted to deny the grievance and\nto uphold the Level II decision.\n\n2. The Level II decision reads in pertinent part as follows:\n       REPORT OF LEVEL TWO CONFERENCE BY SUPERINTENDENT OR DESIGNEE\n       1.

Agency LEXIS 13, *3\n\n3. Date and time of conference: November 2, 2006 at 2:00 p.m.\n4. The facts as presented by the complainant are as follows:\nPressured and mislead into resigning by the Principal-stated the Principal told her that if she did\nnot resign, she would go to HR and have her terminated.\nStated that she did not receive the letter of acceptance of her resignation until after she received\nthe letter of denial of her request to rescind her resignation.\nSubmitted: 2 -- AISD Envelopes Postmarked September 1, 2006 and the other September 6,\n2006.\nSubmitted: Commissioner’s Ruling Docket 115-R8-197 Daniel Suty v Aldine ISD 1997\n5. In my opinion, the allegations made in the original complaint are not adequately supported\nby the facts submitted.\nExplanation:\n. Resignation states the reason for resigning due to travel time it gets to work.\n. The principal stated that she did not tell Ms. Chilton that she would terminate her as this was\nnot within her authority.\n. There is no distinguishing information on the envelopes to determine the contents of either\nenvelope. In discussing HR time frames for mailing letter of acceptance of resignation and the\n [*3] letter of denial of the rescission of resignation requests are as follows:\n    Chilton Resignation Letter                                                      August 24, 2006\n    AISD Letter of Resignation Acceptance Letter                                    August 29, 2006\n    Chilton Request Rescission of Resignation Letter                                August 30, 2006\n                                                                                    (Fax 3:04 PM)\n    Denial of Rescission Request                                                    August 31, 2006\nThe AISD letter of resignation acceptance was mailed on the day that it was signed which was August 29, 2006 therefore, the\nenvelope that Ms. Chilton received had an August 29, 2006 meter on it. Once the resignation was mailed August 29, 2006 it\nwas binding under the law, therefore due notification was given prior to the attempt of rescission by Ms. Chilton on August\n30, 2006.\nEnvelope Dated September 6, 2006- It has been determined that the envelope contained three documents that are sent out to\nall employees leaving the district. Documents include: HR Cover Letter/Directions. Exit Report Form, Personnel Release\nForm.\nEnvelope Dated September 1, 2006-It has been determined that the envelope contained the denial of the rescission request.\n6. In my opinion, the remedy sought by the complainant is not justified by the facts submitted.\nExplanation:\n\nThe written resignation   [*4] was received on August 24, 2006 and formally accepted on August 29,\n2006. Ms. Chilton’s request for rescission was received on August 30, 2006 and formally\ndenied on August 31, 2006. As a result, a vacancy was posted and the principal is active in the\nhiring process. All payout have been completed.\n7. The decision made or recommendations agreed upon as a result of the conference are as\nfollows: None\n                    signed Robert S.

The letter\nreads:\n       August 24, 2006\n       Dear Mrs. Fyfe,\n       I am resigning on August 24, 2006 from Alvin ISD. Due to the travel time it takes me to get\n       to work.\n       Thank you,\n       Laura Chilton\n\n4. On September 1, 2006, a letter dated August 31, 2006 from Robert G. Quinn was mailed to\nPetitioner. The letter reads in relevant part:\n       I am sending you this letter in response to the fax that we received from you on August 30, 2006\n       at 3:04 PM. After review, it has been determined that the district is unable to honor your request\n       based on the following facts:\n       . Your written resignation was received and accepted on August [*5] 24, 2006.\n       . The vacancy created by your resignation is currently posted.\n       . The principal is active in the hiring process for filling the vacancy.\n       . Payroll has finalized your payout and you are not an active employee.\n\n5. On September 6, 2006, a letter dated August 29, 2006 from Robert G. Quinn was mailed to\nPetitioner. The letter reads in relevant part:\n       This letter is to inform you of receipt of your letter of resignation dated August 24, 2006. I do\n       hereby accept your resignation for the position of special education teacher, REACH School,\n       effective August 24, 2006.\n       Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you for your\n       service with Alvin Independent School District and best wishes in your future endeavors.\n\n6. Petitioner had a probationary contract to teach for Respondent for the 2006-2007 school year.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPetitioner contends that Respondent improperly ended her probationary contract. Petitioner contends\nthat she rescinded her offer of resignation before it was accepted.\n\nStandards\n\nThe standards concerning the acceptance of the resignation of a teaching contract after the period for\nunilateral resignation are set forth [*6] in Cantu v. Central Educ. Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382692\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382692/cantu-v-central-educ-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.\nApp.-Austin 1994, no writ). Tex. Educ. Code § 21.205(a). An agreement to rescind a teaching contract\nrequires offer, acceptance and consideration. Id. at 566. The dispute between the parties is whether\n\f                                                                                                 Page 4 of 7\n                                     2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *6\n\nPetitioner rescinded her resignation before Respondent accepted her resignation. The Cantu court has\nheld:\n\n   The aphorism ″the offeror is the master of his offer″ reflects the power of the offeror to impose\n   conditions on acceptance of an offer, specify the manner of acceptance, or withdraw the offer\n   before the offeree has effectively exercised the power of acceptance. However, more often than not,\n   an offeror does not expressly authorize a particular mode, medium, or manner of acceptance.\n   Consequently, particularly with parties communicating at a distance, a rule of law is needed to\n   establish the point of contract formation and allocate the risk of loss and *567 inconvenience that\n   inevitably falls to one of the parties between the time that the offeree exercises, and the offeror\n   receives, the acceptance. See 1 Arthur L. Corbin, Contracts § 78 (1963).\n    [*7] [5] As Professor Corbin notes, courts could adopt a rule that no acceptance is effective until\n   received, absent express authorization by the offeror; however, the mailbox rule, which makes\n   acceptance effective on dispatch, closes the deal and enables performance more promptly, and\n   places the risk of inconvenience on the party who originally has power to control the manner of\n   acceptance. Id. Moreover, ″the mailing of a letter has long been a customary and expected way of\n   accepting [an] offer.″ Id. Therefore, ″[e]ven though the offer was not made by mail and there was\n   no [express] authorization, the existing circumstances may be such as to make it reasonable for the\n   offeree to accept by mail and to give the offeror reason to know that the acceptance will be so\n   made.″ Id. In short, acceptance by mail is impliedly authorized if reasonable under the\n   circumstances\n   [6] The Restatement approves and adopts this approach: an acceptance by any medium reasonable\n   under the circumstances is effective on dispatch, absent a contrary indication in the offer.\n   Restatement (Second) of Contracts §§ 30(2), 63(a), 65, 66 (1979). In addition, the Restatement\n   specifically recognizes that [*8] acceptance by mail is ordinarily reasonable if the parties are\n   negotiating at a distance or even if a written offer is delivered in person to an offeree in the same\n   city. Id. § 65 cmt. c (emphasis added). The same standard, viz., whether the manner of acceptance\n   is reasonable under the circumstances, governs offer and acceptance in commercial transactions\n   under the Texas Business and Commerce Code. See Tex.Bus. & Com.Code Ann. § 2.206 (West\n   1968).\n\nId. at 566-567. In general, an offer may be accepted by mail. The acceptance letter must be properly\naddressed. The time of acceptance is when a properly addressed acceptance is placed in the mail. Id.\nat 566 n.1. If the offer to resign is accepted before the offer is rescinded, the resignation is complete.\n\nMail Box Rule\n\nPetitioner contends that the mailbox rule does not apply in this case. However, as the above quoted\nportion of Cantu makes clear, acceptance by mail is ordinarily reasonable. Petitioner points to nothing\nin the record to show why this usual standard should not apply in this case. Petitioner’s letter of\nresignation does not specify a method [*9] of acceptance. If Respondent placed its acceptance of\nPetitioner’s resignation in the mail, prior to it receiving Petitioner’s fax rescinding the resignation, the\nresignation is effective.\n\nMailing\n\f                                                                                                                           Page 5 of 7\n                                               2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *9\n\nThe central dispute in the present case is ″When did Respondent mail its acceptance of Petitioner’s\nresignation?″ Petitioner attempted to rescind her offer of resignation by a fax on August 30, 2006 at\n3:04 p.m. If Respondent placed its letter in the mailbox prior to that time, Petitioner’s offer was\naccepted and the resignation is final.\n\nAs this is a case against a school district, it is to be decided based on the local record applying the\nsubstantial evidence rule. Tex. Educ. Code § 7.057(c). The substantial evidence standard is generally\nthe standard specified in Texas Government Code section 2001.174. 19 Tex. Admin. Code §\n157.1073(h). In the present case, Respondent specifically upheld the Level II decision. The Level II\ndecision contains findings of fact. Hence, the Commissioner must determine whether the findings of\nfact are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\nAcceptance Letter\n\nRespondent contends that the letter accepting Petitioner’s resignation is itself [*10] evidence that the\nletter was mailed on August 29, 2006 because the letter is dated August 29, 2006. The date on the letter\nis evidence that the letter was drafted that day. It is not evidence that the letter was properly mailed\non that day.\n\nLevel II Decision\nRespondent also contends that the Level II decision itself is evidence that acceptance was mailed on\nAugust 29, 2006. However, the Level II decision was what was appealed to the board. It can no more\nbe considered evidence than an order of a district judge can be as considered evidence by an appellate\ncourt to prove that the district court’s order was supported by evidence.\nAt oral argument, Respondent’s counsel noted that the Level II decision maker was the individual who\ndrafted the acceptance letter and argued that the Level II decision maker had actual knowledge that the\nletter was mailed on time and of the contents of the two envelopes that bear postage meter dates of\nSeptember 1 and 6, 2006 1\n\n. A decision maker must base his decision [*11] on the evidence, not on personal knowledge. It has\nbeen held:\n     Nothing is more thoroughly established than the proposition that neither a judge nor a juror may\n     act as a witness. Glasser v.

The mailbox rule applies to this case. Petitioner rescinded her\nresignation before it was accepted.\n\nReply to the Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision\n\nRespondent correctly notes that the grievance process lacks the formality of a court and that school\ndistricts have wide latitude [*13] to determine their procedures. However, the Commissioner has made\nclear that the hearing given must be a fair hearing:\n\n   While a district has wide latitude to design its own hearing procedures, a grievant needs to be given\n   a fair opportunity to present his case. Taylor v. Marshall Independent School District, Docket No.\n   130-R10-297 (Comm’r Educ. 1997).\n\nAdams v. Flour Bluff Independent School District, Docket No. 115-R10-598 (Comm’r Educ. 1999). A\nhearing is not fair when instead of relying on the facts presented, a decision maker bases a decision\non personal knowledge. The Level II hearing was not a fair hearing. But even if the Level II hearing\nwere a fair hearing, the Level II hearing decision is not evidence to be considered in determining\nwhether substantial evidence supports the board’s decision.\n\nConclusions of Law\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing Findings of Fact,\nin my capacity as Commissioner of Education, I make the following Conclusions of Law:\n\n1. The Commissioner of Education has jurisdiction over Petitioner’s claims under Texas Education\nCode section 7.057.\n\n2. An appeal of a decision of a school district [*14] under Texas Education Code section 7.057 is to\nbe based on a review of the local record under a substantial evidence standard of review. Tex. Educ.\nCode § 7.057(c).\n\n3. In a case where a school district makes findings of fact, the substantial evidence standard of review\nreferenced in Texas Education Code section 7.057(c) is generally the standard identified in Texas\nGovernment Code section 2001.174. 19 Tex. Admin. Code § 157.1073(h).\n\f                                                                                                 Page 7 of 7\n                                    2009 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 13, *14\n\n4. An agreement to rescind a teaching contract, after the period for unilateral resignation, requires offer,\nacceptance, and consideration. Tex. Educ. Code § 21.205(a).\n\n5. An offer can be rescinded before it is accepted.\n\n6. An offer can generally be accepted by mail unless the offer specifies another mode of acceptance.\nAs long as no limitations have been placed on acceptance and acceptance by mail is reasonable under\nthe circumstances, an offer may be accepted by mail. If an offer is accepted by mail, acceptance occurs\nupon dispatch of a properly addressed letter.\n\n7. Since Petitioner placed no restrictions as to how her offer could be accepted and under the\ncircumstances of the present case it was reasonable for the offer of resignation to be accepted [*15]\nby mail, Respondent could have accepted Petitioner’s offer by mail.\n\n8. Respondent could not have accepted Petitioner’s offer after August 30, 2006 at 3:04 p.m. because\nPetitioner rescinded her offer at that time.\n\n9. A Level II decision is a decision made by a finder of fact, it is not evidence of the fact findings\ncontained therein.\n\n10. There is not substantial evidence that Respondent mailed its acceptance letter on August 29, 2006.\n\n11. There is not substantial evidence that a properly addressed letter was mailed by Respondent to\nPetitioner on August 29, 2006.\n\n12. The evidence in the local record conclusively establishes that Respondent mailed its letter of\nacceptance on September 6, 2006.\n\n13. Because Petitioner rescinded her offer of resignation prior to Respondent’s acceptance of her offer\nof resignation, no resignation occurred. Petitioner’s 2006-2007 contract was not ended by resignation.\n\n14. Petitioner’s appeal should be granted.\n\nORDER\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed and the foregoing Findings of Fact and\nConclusions of Law, in my capacity as Commissioner of Education, it is hereby\n\nORDERED that Petitioner’s appeal be, and is hereby, GRANTED.

Respondent is represented by Renee Betancourt,\nAttorney at Law, Edinburg, Texas.\n\nThe central issue in this case is that a classroom teacher cannot be an at-will employee, even in the absence of a written\nemployment contract. When a school district board of trustees fails to approve a probationary, term or continuing contract\nfor a classroom teacher, the board is in violation of chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code, which requires that all teachers\nmust be employed under a written contract. The Commissioner has jurisdiction over the case not as an employment\ncontract matter under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B), but as a violation of the school laws of Texas under\nTexas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n\nFindings of Fact\n\nAfter due consideration of the [*2] record and matters officially noticed, it is concluded that the following Findings of Fact\nare supported by substantial evidence and are the Findings of Fact that best support Respondent’s decision:\n\n1. Respondent employed Petitioner as a classroom teacher under probationary contracts for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012\nschool years. Petitioner resigned at the end of the 2011-2012 school year, and then started working for Respondent as a\nclassroom teacher again at the start of the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n2. Petitioner and Respondent both agree that under Texas Education Code chapter 21 and Respondent’s policies, Petitioner\nwas only eligible for a term contract at the start of the 2012-2013 school year. Both parties agree that Petitioner was not\neligible for a probationary contract under Texas Education Code section 21.102.\n\n3. Under its local policy DC (LOCAL), Respondent’s Board of Trustees (″Board″) ″retains final authority for the\nemployment of contractual and noncontractual personnel.″\n\f                                                                                                                Page 2 of 6\n                                           2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *4\n\n4. The Board did not delegate authority to contract with employees on its behalf.\n\n5. On January 11, 2013, Respondent’s employee or a member of Respondent’s Board presented Petitioner with a\nprobationary [*3] contract for the 2012-2013 school year (″Contract″), and Petitioner signed the Contract.\n\n6. The Board neither approved nor signed the Contract. Respondent and Petitioner agree that as a result, there was no\nwritten contract between Respondent and Petitioner for the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n7. Petitioner worked for Respondent as a classroom teacher throughout the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n8. On April 22, 2013, the Board voted to terminate Petitioner at the end of the 2012-2013 school year as ″an employee\ncurrently employed under an Education Code Chapter 21 probationary contract.″\n\n9. Petitioner filed a formal grievance with Respondent on May 14, 2013, asserting, ″I do not have a fully executed contract\nfor the 2012-2013 school year--the contract on which the district relies is not signed by the board...My employment status\nwith the district should be construed as if I held a term contract.″\n\n10. There is no evidence in the record that Petitioner knew or should have known prior to filing his grievance that the Board\nhad not voted to approve the Contract.\n\n11. There is no evidence of Respondent’s local grievance policy in the local record.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTexas public school teachers must be [*4] employed under one of three different contracts: (1) a probationary contract;\n(2) a continuing contract; or (3) a term contract (collectively, ″Chapter 21 contract″). Tex. Educ. Code § 21.002. A\nclassroom teacher cannot be employed as an at-will employee. Nield v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No.\n024-R10-1110 (Comm’r Educ. 2012) (holding that a classroom teacher is entitled to a a probationary, continuing or term\ncontract under chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code even if the teacher is working under an unwritten contract that\nappears to be at-will). Under a probationary contract, the board of trustees may terminate the teacher’s employment at the\nend of the contract period without advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing if the district believes its best interests\nwill be served by terminating the employment. Tex. Educ. Code § 21.103. Under a term contract, a teacher is entitled to\nnotice and a hearing if a school district intends not to renew the teacher’s contract. Tex. Educ. Code §§ 21.206-21.209. The\nTexas Education Code severely restricts which teachers receive a probationary contract: no teacher can be in a\nprobationary contract for more than the first four [*5] years of employment with a school district, and any teacher that\nhas taught for at least five of the last eight years cannot have a probationary contract for more than one year. Tex. Educ.\nCode § 21.102.\n\nPetitioner and Respondent agree that under chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code (″Chapter 21″), Petitioner was not\nlegally eligible to receive a probationary contract for the 2012-2013 school year. Respondent argues that Petitioner’s claim\narose when he signed a document labelled ″Probationary Contract″ because he should have known at that point that\nRespondent was in violation of Chapter 21 and that he was subject to firing as a probationary contract employee, without\nadvanced notice or a hearing. Respondent asserts that Petitioner should have filed a grievance within 15 days of signing\nthe Contract, and since he failed to do so, the Commissioner has no jurisdiction over Petitioner’s claim. Petitioner counters\nthat because Respondent never adopted the Contract, there was no probationary contract for him to grieve. Petitioner\nargues that without a written contract, he became by default a term contract employee because a term contract was the\nonly possible contract he could have [*6] as a matter of law under Chapter 21. Petitioner further argues that his claim did\nnot arise until Respondent improperly terminated his term contract, so his grievance was timely and the Commissioner has\njurisdiction over his appeal.\n\nTimeliness of Grievance\n\nRespondent asserts that the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over the case because Petitioner did not timely file\na grievance after he signed the Contract, but there is no evidence in the local record of what Respondent’s grievance policy\n\f                                                                                                                 Page 3 of 6\n                                           2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *6\n\nrequired. Although Respondent’s decisions on Petitioner’s grievance reference the policy requirements, the policy itself is\nabsent from the local record. Decisions made by a finder of fact cannot serve as evidence of the facts described therein.\nSee, e.g., Chilton v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 031-R10-0107 (Comm’r Educ. 2009). The Commissioner must\nmake his decision based only on ″a review of the record developed at the district level under a substantial evidence standard\nof review.″ Tex. Educ. Code § 7.057(c). The local record in this case does not contain substantial evidence to support\nRespondent’s holding that Petitioner failed exhaust administrative remedies by filing [*7] a grievance after Respondent’s\nlocal grievance deadline. The Commissioner therefore has jurisdiction over this case.\n\nEven if the local grievance policy was a part of the administrative record, Respondent’s focus on the Contract as the\ntriggering event for Petitioner’s grievance is misplaced. Both parties agree that there is no written contract in this case\nbecause the Board failed to approve the Contract. The fact that Petitioner once signed a document that purported to be a\nprobationary contract when he was legally entitled to a term contract is irrelevant when no probationary contract\nagreement ever actually existed between the parties. Respondent did not violate the Texas Education Code by showing\nPetitioner a document purporting to be a probationary contract and allowing him to sign it. Instead, Respondent violated\nChapter 21 by failing to approve any contract at all for Petitioner. There is no evidence in the record that shows Petitioner\nknew or should have known before he filed his grievance that the Board had failed to approve his contract. Petitioner\ntherefore properly exhausted his administrative remedies at the local level.\n\nJurisdiction Without Written Contract\n\nRespondent [*8] relies heavily on Garza v. Jim Hogg County Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 001-R2-901 (Comm’r Educ.\n2002), to support its position that the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over this case because there was no written\ncontract. Garza involved a school superintendent who did not receive a written employment contract from the school\ndistrict, worked as a superintendent for most of the school year, and then was terminated without notice or hearing. Id. The\nCommissioner in Garza held that he did not have jurisdiction over the case under Texas Education Code section\n7.057(a)(2)(B), which gives the Commissioner jurisdiction over violations of written employment contracts between\nschool districts and school distict employees, because there was no written employment contract. Id. That same principle\napplies in this case--the Commissioner does not have jurisdiction under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B)\nbecause there was no written employment contract between Petitioner and Respondent. The Commissioner does not have\nthe ability to interpret or enforce unwritten employment contracts, so the Commissioner cannot determine whether\nPetitioner was improperly terminated [*9] in this case. See, e.g., Cooper v. Paris Indep. Sch. Dist. Docket No. 83-R2-197\n(Comm’r Educ. 1997) (holding that when there was no written contract, the Commissioner could not enforce contract\ntermination requirements against a school district); see also, Hudson Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Lassiter, Docket No. 251-TTC-897\n(Comm’r Educ. 1998) (″Since there was no written contract between Petitioner and Respondent, the Commissioner cannot\ntake action against Respondent...for abandonment of contact.″). The Commissioner does not have jurisdiction under Texas\nEducation Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B) to determine or enforce termination rights for the unwritten contract Petitioner\nclaims in this case.\nHowever, Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A) provides entirely separate grounds for the Commissioner’s\njurisdiction: the actions or decision of a school board that violate the school laws of this state. In Garza, the Commissioner\nconsidered jurisdiction under section 7.057(a)(2)(A), but looked only to whether the school district had violated Texas\nEducation Code chapter 21, subchapter E by failing to follow the notice and hearing requirements for a term-contract\nemployee. The Commissioner [*10] found that the school district had not violated the term contract termination\nrequirements because there was no evidence that the superintendent in Garza had a term contract. Notably, the\nCommissioner did not consider or address in Garza whether the school district violated Texas Education Code section\n21.002--which requires that a school district employ each classroom teacher under a probationary, continuing, or term\ncontract--because that provision does not apply to superintendents. As this case does involve a classroom teacher, Texas\nEducation Code section 21.002 applies here, rendering Garza inapposite. More on point is Gonzalez v. Donna Indep. Sch.\nDist., Docket No. 074-R10-605 (Comm’r Educ. 2007), a case involving a classroom teacher where the Commissioner held:\n\n    While there may be no written contract, Petitioner has reported to work and Respondent has paid him. There is\n    a contract between Petitioner and Respondent. While the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction over this case based on\n    Texas Education Code section 7.057 (a)(2)(B) because there is no written contract, the Commissioner does have\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 4 of 6\n                                           2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *10\n\n    jurisdiction over this case based on Texas Education Code section 7.057 [*11] (a)(2)(A) because Petitioner alleges\n    violations of the school laws of this state.\n\nIn this case, the Commissioner has jurisdiction section 7.057(a)(2)(A) to determine whether Respondent violated Texas\nEducation Code section 21.002 by failing to employ Petitioner under a Chapter 21 contract.\n\nChapter 21 Contract\n\nRespondent’s failure to employ Petitioner under any of types of contracts listed in Texas Education Code section 21.002\nis a violation of the school laws of Texas. In its decision on Petitioner’s grievance, the Board held that Petitioner was an\nat-will employee because there was no executed written employment contract. The Board was wrong: the Commissioner\nhas previously held that a teacher employed by a school district to teach without a written contract cannot be an at-will\nemployee and must be given a Chapter 21 contract. Nield v. Beaumont Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket No. 024-R10-1110\n(Comm’r Educ. 2012). In failing to approve any Chapter 21 contract for Petitioner, the Board violated Texas Education\nCode section 21.002. As a result, the Board must approve a Chapter 21 contract for Petitioner.\n\nConclusion\n\nRespondent violated the school laws of Texas not when its [*12] superintendent gave Petitioner an unauthorized document\nlabeled ″Probationary Contract″ and allowed him to sign it, but rather when the Board failed to approve any valid Chapter\n21 contract to employ Petitioner as a teacher. Respondent’s local grievance policies were not included in the local record,\nso there is not substantial evidence to support Respondent’s argument that Petitioner failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies by filing his grievance too late. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to show that Petitioner discovered\nbefore he filed his grievance that the Board had not approved his contract, so there is no evidence to dispute his assertion\nthat his grievance was timely. Respondent employed Petitioner as a classroom teacher, so Respondent was legally obligated\nto give Petitioner a Chapter 21 contract--classroom teachers cannot be at-will employees. Respondent must give Petitioner\na Chapter 21 contract for the 2012-2013 school year.\n\nExceptions\n\nBoth Petitioner and Respondent filed Exceptions to the Proposal for Decision. Petitioner excepted to a finding of fact that\nstated it was Respondent’s Superintendent that gave Petitioner the Contract, because the record [*13] shows it was a\nmember of Respondent’s Board, and requested that the Commissioner add additional Conclusions of Law regarding\nPetitioner’s contractual relationship with Respondent during the 2013-2014 school year. Respondent argued that the\nProposal for Decision inappropriately held that there was an oral contract in this case, set incorrect terms for that contract,\nand disregarded Respondent’s interpretation of its own grievance policy with regard to when Petitioner should have filed\na formal grievance.\n\nPetitioner is correct that Findings of Fact 4 and 5 incorrectly named the Superintendent as the person who gave Peitioner\nthe Contract. In fact, there is no evidence in the local record showing precisely which person associated with Respondent\ngave Petitioner the Contract. Petitioner cites the Board’s findings of fact in this case, but the findings of fact from\nRespondent’s Board cannot serve as evidence of the facts they describe. See, e.g., Chilton v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., Docket\nNo. 031-R10-0107 (Comm’r Educ. 2009). The Findings of Fact have been amended accordingly.\n\nPetitioner is incorrect in asserting that the Commissioner should make Conclusions of Law regarding the contractual [*14]\nrelationship between Petitioner and Respondent during the 2013-2014 school year. There is no evidence in the local record\nto support findings beyond the 2012-2013 school year. Petitioner is welcome to pursue the grievance process with\nRespondent to develop a local record regarding the contractual relationship between Petitioner and Respondent during the\n2013-2014 school year in light of this decision, but that record is not currently before the Commissioner in this appeal. No\nother changes will be made in response to Petitioner’s Exceptions.\n\nWith regard to Respondent’s concerns about the oral contract, the question of whether an oral contract existed between\nthe parties is irrelevant to the fact that Respondent violated the Texas Education Code by failing to employ Petitioner under\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 5 of 6\n                                            2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *14\n\na written Chapter 21 contract. The Conclusion of Law on the existence of an oral contract has therefore been removed from\nthe Decision of the Commissioner. However, Respondent is incorrect that the Conclusions of Law, which state Petitioner\nis entitled to a term contract for the 2012-2013 school year and to be paid as a term contract employee was paid in\naccordance with Respondent’s policies during that [*15] period, are somehow setting the terms for a contract that never\nexisted. Rather, these Conclusions of Law merely require Respondent to fulfill its legal obligation under the Texas\nEducation Code to provide its teachers with Chapter 21 contracts and the benefits attendant thereto. The Commissioner has\nnot specified precisely what Petitioner should have been paid--only that it should be what a Chapter 21 contract employee\nin his position was due under Respondent’s policies for the 2012-2013 school year. In doing so, the Commissioner is not\ninterpreting an existing contract, but simply stating the impact of Respondent fulfilling the requirements of the Texas\nEducation Code. To avoid any confusion or misinterpretation, although Petitioner and Respondent agree that Petitioner\ncould only be employed under a term contract according to their mutual interpretation of Respondent’s policies and\nChapter 21, the Conclusions of Law have been amended to refer only to a Chapter 21 contract. No other changes to the\nProposal for Decision are necessary in response to Respondent’s Exceptions regarding the existence of Petitoner’s contract.\n\nRespondent also excepts to Finding of Fact 10, on the grounds [*16] that it incorrectly fails to defer to Respondent’s\ninterpretation of its own local grievance policy. As an initial matter, Respondent’s local grievance policy was not included\nin the local record for this case, and is therefore not properly before the Commissioner. Therefore, all references to specific\nrequirements under Respondent’s local grievance policy that appeared in the Proposal for Decision have been removed. The\ndiscussion of the grievance policy has been amended to hold that there is no substantial evidence in the record of what\nRespondent’s local grievance policy was. Without this evidence in the local record, Respondent cannot show that Petitioner\nfailed to exhaust his administrative remedies by missing the grievance deadline.\n\nBut regardless of what specific deadlines Respondent’s local grievance policy gave for filing a formal grievance, the parties\nagree that the operative question to determine if Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies is whether Petitioner\nknew or should have known about the cause of his grievance significantly before he filed the grievance. While Finding of\nFact 10 may have been unclearly worded, the Commissioner’s finding is that Petitioner [*17] did not have reason to know\nbefore he filed his grievance with Petitioner that the Board had failed to approve his contract, nullifying the contract. The\nwording of Finding of Fact 10 has been revised in an effort to make it clearer. Aside from those described above, no other\nchanges will be made to the Proposal for Decision in response to Respondent’s Exceptions.\n\nConclusions of Law\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing Findings of Fact, in my capacity as\nAdministrative Law Judge, I make the following Conclusions of Law:\n\n1. The Commissioner of Education has jurisdiction over this cause under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n\n2. Petitioner does not have a written contract with Respondent.\n\n3. Petitioner filed his grievance timely.\n\n4. Texas school districts cannot employ classroom teachers as at-will employees.\n\n5. The contractual requirements of Chapter 21 of the Texas Education Code are mandatory.\n\n6. Petitioner is entitled to a written Chapter 21 contract for the 2012-2013 school year.\n\n7. Petitioner is entitled to the amount of pay that he should have received for the written Chapter 21 contract had it existed\nduring the [*18] 2012-2013 school year under Texas Education Code section 21.402 and Respondent’s policies, less the\namount of pay that he has already received.\n\n8. Petitioner is entitled to accrue the Teachers Retirement System contributions that Respondent should have made for the\nwritten Chapter 21 contract had it existed during the 2012-2013 school year, less any contributions Respondent already\nmade for Petitioner.\n\f                                                                                                             Page 6 of 6\n                                         2014 TX Educ. Agency LEXIS 46, *18\n\n9. Petitioner’s appeal should be granted as specified. Any relief not explicitly granted should be denied.\n\nORDER\n\nAfter due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw, in my capacity as the Commissioner of Education, it is hereby\n\nORDERED that the Petitioner’s appeal be, and is hereby, GRANTED, and\n\nFURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall reinstate Petitioner as if he had a written Chapter 21 contract for the\n2012-2013 school year, and pay all resulting back pay and benefits owed under such a contract in accordance with\nRespondent’s polices that has not already been paid to Petitioner.\n\nSIGNED AND ISSUED this 7th day of October, 2014.\n\f           APPENDIX 3\n\n\n\nMontgomery v.

Christopher Maska is the\nAdministrative Law Judge appointed by the Commissioner of Education. Petitioner is\nrepresented by Mark W. Robinett, Attorney at Law, Austin, Texas.                    Respondent is\nrepresented by Sandra Carpenter, Attorney at Law, Austin, Texas.\n        The Administrative Law Judge issued a Proposal for Decision recommending that\nPetitioner’s appeal be dismissed in part and denied in part.\n                                         Findings of Fact\n        After due consideration of the record and matters officially noticed, it is\nconcluded that the following Findings of Fact are supported by substantial evidence and\n\nare the Findings of Fact that best support Respondent’s decision1.\n        1.      Petitioner was employed by Respondent under a term contract for the\n2007-2008 school year. Most of the terms of this contract are not in the local record.\nPetitioner was employed by Respondent as an elementary school principal for the 2007-\n2008 school year.\n        2.      Petitioner was employed by Respondent under a term contract for the\n2008-2009 school. The terms of this contract are in the local record. The contract is\n\n1\n See 19 TEX. ADMIN. CODE § 157.1073(h); Bosworth v. East Central Independent School District, Docket\nNo. 090-R1-803 (Comm’r Educ. 2003).\n\n\n007-R10-1008\n\f“For Professional Administrator.” Petitioner was employed as a Program Specialist II\nfor the 2008-2009 school year.\n       3.       Petitioner was assigned to work the same number of days and was\nscheduled to receive the same compensation for the 2008-2009 school year as Petitioner\nreceived for the 2007-2008 school year.\n       4.       As a Program Specialist II, Petitioner reports to the Director of\nProfessional Development. Petitioner’s general responsibilities concern all new teachers\nand district-wide professional development.            Petitioner’s specific duties and\nresponsibilities as a Program Specialist II are unclear from the record.\n                                        Discussion\n       Petitioner contends that Respondent changed her professional capacity when it\nreassigned her from the position of Elementary Magnet School Principal to the position\nof Program Specialist II. In particular, Petitioner maintains that the position of a campus\nprincipal is a distinct professional capacity.     Petitioner also contends that she was\ndemoted. Respondent denies Petitioner’s claims.\nDemotion\n       The Texas Education Code does not prohibit a school district from demoting a\nteacher. Petitioner has not alleged that any section or sections of the Texas Education\n\nCode prohibit demotions.       To the extent the Commissioner has jurisdiction over\ndemotions, that authority must come from Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B)\nwhich gives the Commissioner jurisdiction over violations of written employment\ncontracts that cause or would cause monetary harm. Because Petitioner has not lost\nsalary or benefits Petitioner cannot show the requisite monetary harm. Smith v.

The Commissioner lacks\njurisdiction over Petitioner’s demotion claim.\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                2\n\fSame Professional Capacity\n         A “teacher2” who holds a term contract under Texas Education Code chapter 21,\nsubchapter E that is about to expire cannot be reassigned to a new position for the next\nschool year unless the position is within the same professional capacity as the position the\n“teacher” held in the current school year:\n\n\n         (a)ANot later than the 45th day before the last day of instruction in a school year,\n         the board of trustees shall notify in writing each teacher whose contract is about to\n         expire whether the board proposes to renew or not renew the contract.\n         (b)    the board’s failure to give the notice required by Subsection (a) within the\n         time specified constitutes an election to employ the teacher in the same\n         professional capacity for the following school year.\nTEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206. The term “same professional capacity” is not defined in the\nTexas Education Code.            However, the Commissioner from the earliest substantive\ndecision concerning this provision has held that “administrator” is a professional\ncapacity.\n\n\n         It is more reasonable to conclude that the legislature, by using the term “same\n         professional capacity” (instead of “exact same position”), intended to allow\n         school districts to be flexible in their personnel assignments while discouraging\n         the abuse of the district’s inherent or contractual authority. In other words, the\n         district may place a teacher whose employment has been renewed by operation of\n         law in a position different from that to which the teacher was assigned the\n         previous year, as long as the position is one to which the district could have\n         reassigned the teacher had the parties voluntarily entered into a contract for the\n         following year. In some instances the validity of a particular placement will be\n         clear. For example, an administrator who does not receive the required notice by\n         April 13 may not be placed in the capacity of a classroom teacher. . .\n                  In other instances, the validity of a particular placement might not be so\n         clear. For example, a placement might be to another position within the same\n         professional category (e.g., administrator), but nevertheless be invalid (e.g., from\n         superintendent to assistant elementary school principal). Factors to be considered\n\n\n2\n  The definition of “teacher” found at Texas Education Code section 21.201 is truly a creature of statute. It\nincludes individuals who would never in common speech be referred to as teachers.\n3\n  In the original Term Contract Nonrenewal Act, a district had to propose nonrenewal on or before April 1,\ninstead of the current requirement of “the 45th day before the last day of instruction.” Term Contract\nNonrenewal Act, 67th Leg., R.S. , ch. 765, § 2, 1981 Tex. Gen Laws 2847.\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                         3\n\f        in determining the validity of such an assignment include, but are not limited to\n        differences in authority, duties, and salary.\nBarich v. San Felipe-Del Rio Consolidated Independent School District, Docket No. 117-\nR1a-484 (Comm’r Educ. 1985).                Further, the Commissioner has found that the\nprofessional capacity of “administrator” is to be broadly interpreted:\n       It is possible to imagine situations where the transfer clause of an employment\n       contract would be held to be unenforceable under § 21.204(b) 4. However, this is\n       not such a case. It has been the consistent view of the Commissioner that the\n       TCNA balanced its grant of limited tenure rights against the considerable\n       personnel management problems it might cause if imposed inflexibly. Districts\n       have responded to this law by creating broad classes within which transfers do not\n       implicate the TCNA. If taken to extremes, this tactic would be against public\n       policy as expressed in the TCNA, but I cannot make such a finding in this case.\n       The need for flexibility in making personnel changes is strongest, and the\n       argument for a rigid tenure system weakest, at the administrative level. In short, I\n       find the generic “administrator” position before me consistent with the policies of\n       the TCNA.\nCarpenter v. Wichita Falls Independent School District, Docket No. 247-R3-491\n(Comm’r Educ. 1993).           In many cases, it will not constitute a violation of Texas\nEducation Code section 21.206, for a district to reassign a term contract administrator\nfrom a position with one administrative job title to a position that has a different\nadministrative job title.\n        As Carpenter indicates, what professional capacity a “teacher” holds is to a\ncertain extent determined by the employment contract.                  However, districts are not\ncompletely free to determine what professional capacity a “teacher” has. A professional\ncapacity must be a legitimate professional capacity.               Young v. Leggett Independent\nSchool District, Docket No. 175-R3-898 (Comm’r Educ. 1999). Petitioner’s 2007-2008\ncontract is not in the record and there is not evidence in the record as to what Petitioner’s\n2007-2008 contract said as to the issue of Petitioner’s professional capacity. Assuming\nthat Petitioner’s 2007-2008 contract5 was for the professional capacity of administrator,\nthis professional capacity encompasses principals. A district is not required to employee\n4\n  The old Texas Education Code section 21.204 is the predecessor of the current Texas Education Code\nsection 21.206.\n5\n  Petitioner’s 2008-2009contract is entitled “For Professional Administrator.”\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                      4\n\fa principal in the professional capacity of principal. A district may employee a principal\nin the professional capacity of administrator. To determine if a district may reassign an\nadministrator, who is employed as a principal, to another position, the two positions need\nto be compared.\nPrincipal and Program Specialist II\n       Applying the factors noted in Barich is difficult in this case because the record is\nsparse as to issues of differences in authority, duties, and salary.       While Petitioner\ncontends that there is a significant difference in salary between her former principal\nposition and the compensation that the salary schedules assigns to a Program Specialist\nII, Petitioner makes no citation to the record for this claim and the local record appears to\nlack such information. The record does indicate that for the 2008-2009 school year,\nPetitioner will retain the same salary and work days as Petitioner did for the previous\nschool year. Local Record, Tab 3.\nAuthority and Duties\n       As to the comparison of authority and duties, Petitioner in her brief, after making\ncitations to the Texas Education Code concerning the duties of principals, states:\n                There are no like provisions detailing the legislature’s expectations and\n        demands of Program Specialists-whether category I, II, III, or MMIX. The only\n        thing that can be said with certainly about Program Specialist is that they are not\n        like principals in any meaningful way, shape, or form. Instead the position of\n        Program Specialist II is a subordinate position at the Professional Development\n        Center that contains no duties, responsibilities, or authority over the district’s\n        students.\nIt is true that the Texas Education Code does not detail duties or expectations for\nProgram Specialists. As for the other claims, Petitioner fails to make citations to the\nrecord. However, it is true that as a Program Specialist II Petitioner reports to the\nDirector of Professional Development. Local Record, Tab 3. Petitioner is correct that\n\nher new position does not give her authority over students.          Local Record, Tab 7\nattachment. It gives Petitioner responsibilities concerning all new teachers and district-\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                5\n\fwide professional development. This is known from the job discretion for Professional\nDevelopment Specialist that is the record. It is a general description. Petitioner was told\nby the Director of Professional Development what her specific responsibilities were to be\nbut the more specific description is not in local record. The record fails to provide a clear\npicture of Petitioner’s duties and responsibilities in her new job.        As the grievant,\nPetitioner had the burden of proof before the board of trustees. Applying the Barich\nstandards, a reasonable finder of fact could have concluded that Petitioner failed to meet\nher burden of proof that the two positions at issue are not in the same professional\ncapacity. There is substantial evidence to support the denial of Petitioner’s grievance.\nConclusion\n       Respondent did not violate Texas Education Code section 21.206, when it\nreassigned Petitioner.\n                                    Conclusions of Law\n       After due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed, and the foregoing\nFindings of Fact, in my capacity as Commissioner of Education, I make the following\nConclusions of Law:\n       1.       The Commissioner has jurisdiction to over Petitioner’s Texas Education\nCode section 21.206 claim under Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n\n       2.       The Commissioner lacks jurisdiction over Petitioner’s demotion claim.\nTEX. EDUC. CODE § 7.057(a)(2)(B).\n       3.       The Commissioner does not have jurisdiction over demotion claims based\non Texas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(A).\n       4.       The Commissioner may have jurisdiction over a demotion claim if a\nviolation of a written employment contract is alleged that causes or would cause\nmonetary harm. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 7.057(a)(2)(B).\n       5.       The monetary harm referred to in Texas Education Code section\n7.057(a)(2)(B) must be a contract damage. If an employee does not lose salary or\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                6\n\fbenefits based on an alleged violation of a written contract, the employee has not suffered\nmonetary harm.\n       6.       Because Petitioner did not suffer monetary harm as that term is used in\nTexas Education Code section 7.057(a)(2)(B), the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction over\nPetitioner’s demotion claim.\n       7.       Administrator is a professional capacity as that term is used in Texas\nEducation Code section 21.206(b).\n       8.       The professional capacity of administrator, as it applies to Texas\nEducation Code section 21.206(b), is a broad professional capacity.\n       9.       A “teacher” who is employed as a principal may be employed in the\nprofessional capacity of administrator. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206(b).\n       10.      To determine whether two positions are in the same professional capacity,\na comparison should be made of any differences in authority, duties, and salary, along\nwith any other relevant factors. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206(b).\n       11.      A grievant has the burden of proof before a school board.\n       12.      As this case is an appeal of a school district’s decision, the substantial\nevidence standard applies. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 7.057(c).\n       13.      There is substantial evidence to support Respondent’s determination that\n\nthe two positions at issue that Petitioner held are not in different professional capacities.\nTEX. EDUC. CODE § 21.206(b).\n       14.      Respondent did not violate Texas Education Code section 21.206(b) when\nit reassigned Petitioner from the position of elementary principal to the position of\nProgram Specialist II.\n       15.      The Petition for Review should be dismissed in part and denied in part.\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                7\n\f                                                 Order\n        After due consideration of the record, matters officially noticed and the foregoing\nFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in my capacity as Commissioner of Education,\nit is hereby\n        ORDERED that Petitioner’s appeal be, dismissed in part and denied in part.\n        SIGNED AND ISSUED this ______ day of _______________________, 2012.\n\n\n\n                                      ______________________________________\n                                      ROBERT SCOTT\n                                      COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION\n\n\n\n\n#007-R10-1008                                8\n\f             APPENDIX 4\n\nTitle 19 Tex.
