That order granted the Defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss his civil rights complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted. While we agree that Mutschler’s complaint is\n\ninadequate, we will vacate the District Court’s order and remand with instructions to\n\nallow Mutschler the opportunity to amend his complaint.\n\n       In his initial complaint, Dkt. #1, Mutschler sued SCI Frackville’s Superintendent\n\nand facility manager, a department superintendent, and a hearing examiner. He alleged\n\nthat his due process rights were violated when he was denied the right to call witnesses\n\non his behalf “and have evidence” at a misconduct hearing on April 8, 2014. He also\n\nalleged that there were “incomplete records” and an “incomplete investigation.”\n\nMutschler’s complaint did not provide a misconduct number, a description of the\n\nmisconduct charged, or explain the sanction that he received. He alleged that if he had\n\nbeen found not guilty of the misconduct, he would have been eligible for parole. He also\n\nalleged (without explanation) that the prison officials’ responses were untimely.\n\n       Before the Defendants answered the complaint, Mutschler filed a “petition in\n\nsupplemental complaint,” adding four defendants. Dkt. #9. He alleged that two of these\n\nadded prison official defendants deprived him of his due process rights by lying “on a\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fgovernment document by false report and signing to it.”1 Dkt. #9 at 2. He mentioned the\n\nword “retaliation” several times in the supplement, but the only concrete allegation\n\nregarding retaliation stated:\n\n       Because of recent events and continuing retailation there is another suit that\n       will be filed separate from this suit is for the beating I received with my\n       hands cuffed behind my back this type of retailation continues because I\n       made swore statements against staff here in this falicity that I personaly\n       witness and was expected to look the other way and I did not.\n\nDkt. #9 at 3 (misspellings in original).\n\n       The District Court construed Mutschler’s complaint as consisting of the original\n\nfiling (Dkt. #1) and the supplement (Dkt. #9). Dist. Ct. Order, Dkt. #10. The Defendants\n\nfiled a motion to dismiss, arguing that Mutschler’s claims should be dismissed for three\n\nreasons: (1) claims against four of the defendants should be dismissed because he failed\n\nto allege personal involvement; (2) his retaliation claims, due process claims, and Eighth\n\nAmendment claims should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can\n\nbe granted; and (3) any claims for money damages against the Defendants acting in their\n\nofficial capacities were barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Mutschler filed a response\n\nin opposition to the motion and also moved for appointment of counsel and for discovery.\n\n       The District Court denied Mutschler’s motions and granted the Defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss. The Court observed that Mutschler failed to allege personal\n\ninvolvement of several defendants, and held that “participation in the after-the-fact\n\n\n1\n Mutschler also mentioned “cruel and unusual punishment” without explaining exactly\nwhat that punishment was.\n                                             3\n\freview of a grievance is not enough to establish personal involvement.” Dist. Ct. Op. at\n\n5-6, Dkt. #34 (citing Evancho v. Fisher, 423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir. 2005), and Rode v.\n\nDellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1208 (3d Cir. 1988)). As for his due process claims, the\n\nCourt, citing Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir. 2000), held that Mutschler had\n\n“fail[ed] to articulate a sufficient liberty interest to trigger a valid due process claim”\n\nbecause he did not claim that he was subject to atypical or significant hardships. The\n\nCourt noted that he was sanctioned only to 180 days of disciplinary confinement,2 and\n\nthat he did “not raise any claims that the conditions of his confinement in disciplinary\n\nsegregation were significantly more restrictive than those imposed on other inmates in\n\nsolitary confinement.” Dist. Ct. Op., Dkt. #34 at 10. The Court noted that to the extent\n\nhe claimed that the sanction negatively impacted his parole chances, inmates do not have\n\na liberty interest under Pennsylvania law or the United States Constitution in being\n\n\n2\n  The District Court referred to Mutschler’s attachment to a filing titled “Brief in\nsupporting Plaintiff’s Claim to Show Merit to Proceeded to Jury Trial at this time,\nwithout further delay,” which included his grievance forms and responses. Dkt. #28-2.\nOne response notes that he was sanctioned with 180 days of disciplinary confinement,\nwhich the District Court found was not an atypical or significant hardship. As noted,\nMutschler did not include any details regarding the misconduct in his complaint or\nsupplement to the complaint. However, we have recognized that “[a]lthough a district\ncourt may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings, a document integral to or\nexplicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion\nto dismiss into one for summary judgment.” Angstadt v. Midd-West Sch. Dist., 377 F.3d\n338, 342 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). That the District Court relied\non documents that Mutschler produced after the briefing on the motion to dismiss had\nbeen completed gives us some pause. But there is no evidence that the Defendants were\nprejudiced by the Court’s reference to these documents, to which they presumably had\nready access.\n\n                                               4\n\freleased on parole before their sentences expire. Id. (citing Greenholtz v. Inmates of\n\nNeb. Penal & Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979)). Finally, as to the retaliation claim,\n\nthe Court noted that Mutschler appeared to be planning to raise the retaliation claim in a\n\nseparate lawsuit, but that to the extent he sought to raise the claim in the current\n\ncomplaint, it was “wholly inadequate,” as there were no facts alleging that he was\n\nengaged in any constitutionally protected conduct. Id. at 13. Mutschler timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review the District Court’s\n\nOctober 9, 2014 order dismissing Mutschler’s complaint. We exercise plenary review\n\nover a district court’s decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Fleisher v.\n\nStandard Ins. Co., 679 F.3d 116, 120 (3d Cir. 2012). “[I]n deciding a motion to dismiss,\n\nall well-pleaded allegations of the complaint must be taken as true and interpreted in the\n\nlight most favorable to the plaintiffs, and all inferences must be drawn in favor of them.”\n\nMcTernan v. City of York, 577 F.3d 521, 526 (3d Cir. 2009) (quotation marks omitted).\n\nTo withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint “must contain sufficient\n\nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)).\n\n       We agree with the District Court that the complaint, as filed, does not state a claim\n\nupon which relief may be granted. As the Court noted, a prisoner’s civil rights complaint\n\ncannot be based on respondeat superior. See Parkell v. Danberg, 833 F.3d 313, 330 (3d\n\n\n                                                5\n\fCir. 2016).3 And we agree that Mutschler’s complaint did not make out a due process\n\nclaim, as the complaint failed to include facts that suggest that he experienced\n\ndisciplinary sanctions that involved a protected liberty interest. See Smith v. Mensinger,\n\n293 F.3d 641, 652 (3d Cir. 2002) (upholding district court’s conclusion that seven\n\nmonths’ disciplinary time did not constitute due process violation); Fantone v. Latini, 780\n\nF.3d 184, 188-90 (3d Cir. 2015) (inmate did not have protected liberty interest where he\n\nwas confined in restricted housing unit for 35 days, which caused state parole board to\n\nrescind his parole grant, as those factors “did not, either alone or in combination, create\n\natypical and significant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life”); see\n\nalso Burns v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 642 F.3d 163, 171 (3d Cir. 2011) (“[I]nmates are\n\ngenerally not entitled to procedural due process in prison disciplinary hearings because\n\nthe sanctions resulting from those hearings do not usually affect a protected liberty\n\ninterest.”). And we agree that Mutschler’s retaliation claims, to the extent he sought to\n\nraise them in the current proceedings, were undeveloped. See Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d\n\n330, 333 (3d Cir. 2001) (setting forth elements of retaliation claim).\n\n       But if a complaint is vulnerable to dismissal, a district court generally must first\n\n\n3\n In other words, supervisors are not vicariously liable for their subordinates’ acts. But\nsupervisory liability is allowed if the plaintiff shows that the supervisors “established and\nmaintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused the constitutional harm,” or\n“they participated in violating plaintiff's rights, directed others to violate them, or, as the\npersons in charge, had knowledge of and acquiesced in their subordinates’ violations.”\nId. Thus, Mutschler’s complaint did not state a claim against Defendants John Wetzel\nand Robin Lewis, as his complaint did not mention any action on the part of those\ndefendants.\n                                              6\n\fpermit the plaintiff to file a curative amendment.4 See Fletcher-Harlee Corp. v. Pote\n\nConcrete Contractors, Inc., 482 F.3d 247, 252 (3d Cir. 2007) (observing that in civil\n\nrights cases, “leave to amend must be granted sua sponte before dismissing” the\n\ncomplaint). “Dismissal without leave to amend is justified only on the grounds of bad\n\nfaith, undue delay, prejudice, or futility.” Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 236 (3d Cir.\n\n2004). The District Court did not give Mutschler an opportunity to amend his complaint,\n\nnor did it indicate that any amendment would be inequitable or futile. After reviewing\n\nMutschler’s filings, we conclude that it would not be futile to allow Mutschler to amend\n\nhis complaint.5\n\n\n\n4\n  Appellees failed to address this issue in their brief, despite the Clerk’s briefing\ninstructions.\n5\n  We note that Mutschler did not have the opportunity, for example, to amend his\ncomplaint to allege that the sanctions he experienced were somehow atypical or\nsignificant. Cf. Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209, 223-24 (2005) (indefinite detention in\nextremely restrictive housing, with no parole eligibility, could infringe on inmate’s\nliberty interests). We also note that it appears that Mutschler alleges that he was\nsanctioned for writing his autobiography, which was construed by the prison to be child\npornography. Mutschler alleges in his brief here that he was writing the story as part of\nhis mental health therapy. His allegations raise some interesting issues about the tension\nbetween a prisoner’s First Amendment right of expression, his Eighth Amendment right\nto mental health treatment, and the prison’s legitimate penological objectives. See, e.g.,\nPell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974) (“[A] prison inmate retains those First\nAmendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the\nlegitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.”); Brown v. Plata, 563 U.S.\n493, 500, 510-11 (2011) (Eighth Amendment requires prisons to provide adequate mental\nhealth care). And, as the District Court recognized, it is not entirely clear whether\nMutschler was attempting to raise retaliation claims in the current complaint. On\nremand, Mutschler should have the opportunity, if he wishes, to amend his complaint to\naddress these issues.\n                                               7\n\f      While we affirm the District Court’s order in large measure, we will vacate the\n\norder and remand so that the District Court can grant Mutschler an opportunity to file an\n\namended complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f",

That order granted the Defendants’\n\nmotion to dismiss his civil rights complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted. While we agree that Mutschler’s complaint is\n\ninadequate, we will vacate the District Court’s order and remand with instructions to\n\nallow Mutschler the opportunity to amend his complaint.\n\n       In his initial complaint, Dkt. #1, Mutschler sued SCI Frackville’s Superintendent\n\nand facility manager, a department superintendent, and a hearing examiner. He alleged\n\nthat his due process rights were violated when he was denied the right to call witnesses\n\non his behalf “and have evidence” at a misconduct hearing on April 8, 2014.

As for his due process claims, the\n\nCourt, citing Shoats v.

The\n\nCourt noted that he was sanctioned only to 180 days of disciplinary confinement,2 and\n\nthat he did “not raise any claims that the conditions of his confinement in disciplinary\n\nsegregation were significantly more restrictive than those imposed on other inmates in\n\nsolitary confinement.” Dist. Ct. Op., Dkt. #34 at 10. The Court noted that to the extent\n\nhe claimed that the sanction negatively impacted his parole chances, inmates do not have\n\na liberty interest under Pennsylvania law or the United States Constitution in being\n\n\n2\n  The District Court referred to Mutschler’s attachment to a filing titled “Brief in\nsupporting Plaintiff’s Claim to Show Merit to Proceeded to Jury Trial at this time,\nwithout further delay,” which included his grievance forms and responses. Dkt. #28-2.\nOne response notes that he was sanctioned with 180 days of disciplinary confinement,\nwhich the District Court found was not an atypical or significant hardship. As noted,\nMutschler did not include any details regarding the misconduct in his complaint or\nsupplement to the complaint. However, we have recognized that “[a]lthough a district\ncourt may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings, a document integral to or\nexplicitly relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion\nto dismiss into one for summary judgment.” Angstadt v. Midd-West Sch.

That the District Court relied\non documents that Mutschler produced after the briefing on the motion to dismiss had\nbeen completed gives us some pause. But there is no evidence that the Defendants were\nprejudiced by the Court’s reference to these documents, to which they presumably had\nready access.\n\n                                               4\n\freleased on parole before their sentences expire.

Finally, as to the retaliation claim,\n\nthe Court noted that Mutschler appeared to be planning to raise the retaliation claim in a\n\nseparate lawsuit, but that to the extent he sought to raise the claim in the current\n\ncomplaint, it was “wholly inadequate,” as there were no facts alleging that he was\n\nengaged in any constitutionally protected conduct. Id. at 13. Mutschler timely appealed.\n\n       We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review the District Court’s\n\nOctober 9, 2014 order dismissing Mutschler’s complaint. We exercise plenary review\n\nover a district court’s decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Fleisher v.\n\nStandard Ins.

And we agree that Mutschler’s retaliation claims, to the extent he sought to\n\nraise them in the current proceedings, were undeveloped. See Rauser v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (3d Cir. 2001) (setting forth elements of retaliation claim).\n\n       But if a complaint is vulnerable to dismissal, a district court generally must first\n\n\n3\n In other words, supervisors are not vicariously liable for their subordinates’ acts. But\nsupervisory liability is allowed if the plaintiff shows that the supervisors “established and\nmaintained a policy, practice or custom which directly caused the constitutional harm,” or\n“they participated in violating plaintiff's rights, directed others to violate them, or, as the\npersons in charge, had knowledge of and acquiesced in their subordinates’ violations.”\nId. Thus, Mutschler’s complaint did not state a claim against Defendants John Wetzel\nand Robin Lewis, as his complaint did not mention any action on the part of those\ndefendants.\n                                              6\n\fpermit the plaintiff to file a curative amendment.4 See Fletcher-Harlee Corp. v.

The District Court did not give Mutschler an opportunity to amend his complaint,\n\nnor did it indicate that any amendment would be inequitable or futile. After reviewing\n\nMutschler’s filings, we conclude that it would not be futile to allow Mutschler to amend\n\nhis complaint.5\n\n\n\n4\n  Appellees failed to address this issue in their brief, despite the Clerk’s briefing\ninstructions.\n5\n  We note that Mutschler did not have the opportunity, for example, to amend his\ncomplaint to allege that the sanctions he experienced were somehow atypical or\nsignificant. Cf. Wilkinson v. Austin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799975\"><a href=\"/opinion/799975/wilkinson-v-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223-24 (2005) (indefinite detention in\nextremely restrictive housing, with no parole eligibility, could infringe on inmate’s\nliberty interests). We also note that it appears that Mutschler alleges that he was\nsanctioned for writing his autobiography, which was construed by the prison to be child\npornography. Mutschler alleges in his brief here that he was writing the story as part of\nhis mental health therapy. His allegations raise some interesting issues about the tension\nbetween a prisoner’s First Amendment right of expression, his Eighth Amendment right\nto mental health treatment, and the prison’s legitimate penological objectives. See, e.g.,\nPell v. Procunier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109079\"><a href=\"/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (1974) (“[A] prison inmate retains those First\nAmendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the\nlegitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.”); Brown v. Plata, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">493</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500, 510-11 (2011) (Eighth Amendment requires prisons to provide adequate mental\nhealth care). And, as the District Court recognized, it is not entirely clear whether\nMutschler was attempting to raise retaliation claims in the current complaint. On\nremand, Mutschler should have the opportunity, if he wishes, to amend his complaint to\naddress these issues.\n                                               7\n\f      While we affirm the District Court’s order in large measure, we will vacate the\n\norder and remand so that the District Court can grant Mutschler an opportunity to file an\n\namended complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f</pre>",
