KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n                           OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Since 1887, the Kamehameha Schools have operated as the\ncharitable legacy of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the last\ndirect descendant of King Kamehameha I. Private and non-\nsectarian, the Kamehameha Schools give preference to stu-\ndents who are of native Hawaiian ancestry. As a result of this\npolicy, attendance at the Kamehameha Schools is effectively\nlimited to those descended from the Hawaiian race. The issue\nconsidered here is a significant one in our statutory civil rights\nlaw: May a private, nonsectarian, commercially operated\nschool, which receives no federal funds, purposefully exclude\na student qualified for admission solely because he is not of\npure or part aboriginal blood? The parties agree that this is a\ncase of first impression in our circuit.\n\n   The plaintiff, John Doe, appeals the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants, the Kamehameha\nSchools and the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate and its individ-\nual trustees. He argues that he was denied entry to the Kame-\nhameha Schools because of his race in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981, which forbids racial discrimination in the making and\nenforcement of contracts. For the following reasons, we agree\nwith Doe and find that the Schools’ admissions policy, which\noperates in practice as an absolute bar to admission for those\nof the non-preferred race, constitutes unlawful race discrimi-\nnation in violation of § 1981. Accordingly, we reverse the dis-\ntrict court’s decision granting summary judgment to the\nKamehameha Schools.\n\n                                I\n\n   The facts are not in dispute. The Kamehameha Schools\ncomprises a system of private, nonsectarian schools which are\ndispersed among the Hawaiian Islands. See EEOC v. Kameha-\nmeha Sch./Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458, 461 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        8927\nThe school system was founded in 1887 under a “charitable\ntestamentary trust established by the last direct descendent of\n[Hawaii’s] King Kamehameha I, Princess Bernice Pauahi\nBishop.” Burgert v. Lokelani Bernice Pauahi Bishop Trust,\n200 F.3d 661, 663 (9th Cir. 2000). At the time of her death\nin 1884, Princess Pauahi Bishop was the largest landowner in\nHawai‘i, owning approximately one-tenth of the aggregate\nlands. Her will provided that the bulk of her estate should be\nplaced in a charitable trust “to erect and maintain in the\nHawaiian Islands two schools, each for boarding and day\nscholars, one for boys and one for girls, to be known as, and\ncalled the Kamehameha Schools.” Will of Bernice Pauahi\nBishop, reprinted in WILLS AND DEEDS OF TRUST 17-18 (3d ed.\n1957) (hereinafter “Pauahi Bishop Will”). See also Kameha-\nmeha Sch./Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d at 459.\n\n   Under the direction of the original trustees, chaired by\nPauahi’s husband, Charles Reed Bishop, both schools opened\nshortly after her death; the boys’ school in the Fall of 1887\nand the girls’ in the Fall of 1894. The two schools were con-\nsolidated into one coeducational institution during the 1965-\n66 academic year. Currently, the Kamehameha Schools oper-\nate K-12 campuses on three separate islands, Kapalama\n(O‘ahu), Pukalani (Maui), and Kea‘au (Island of Hawai‘i),\nenrolling more than 16,000 children annually. While the\nSchools subsidize much of the educational costs through\nfunds held in trust, annual tuition remains at $1,784 for K-\n12th grade students, with approximately sixty-five percent of\nthose enrolled receiving some form of financial aid.1\n\n   Pauahi’s will contains several instructions pertaining to the\n  1\n    With the forced sale of the Bishop trust lands under the Hawai‘i Land\nReform Act in the 1980s, see Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229\n(1984), the Schools, which were previously “land rich and cash poor,”\nsuddenly had an abundance of working capital. The Bernice Pauahi\nBishop Estate is currently one of the world’s wealthiest charities, with an\nestimated worth of $6 billion.\n\f8928                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nadministration of the Kamehameha Schools, none of which\nestablish race as an admissions criteria. She directs that all\nstudents attending the Kamehameha Schools should be pro-\nvided “first and chiefly a good education in the common\nEnglish branches, and also instruction in morals and in such\nuseful knowledge as may tend to make good and industrious\nmen and women” and, in addition, that “the teachers of said\nschools shall forever be persons of the Protestant religion.”\nPauahi Bishop Will at 18-19. See also Kamehameha Sch./\nBishop Estate, 990 F.2d at 461 (concluding that the Schools\ndo not fall within any of the three religious exemptions pro-\nvided in Title VII and, therefore, the failure to consider a non-\nProtestant teacher on account of her religion was discrimina-\ntory). She further instructs that a portion of the trust’s annual\nincome should be devoted “to the support and education of\norphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the pref-\nerence to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.” Pauahi\nBishop Will at 18. While this racial preference is expressly\nlisted as a criterion for the administration of estate resources\ncharitably directed to orphans and indigents, the Will is nota-\nbly devoid of any mention of race as a criterion for admission\ninto the Kamehameha Schools. As the Schools’ 1885 Pro-\nspectus observed: “The noble minded Hawaiian chiefess who\nendowed the Kamehameha Schools, put no limitations of race\nor condition on her general bequest. Instruction will be given\nonly in English language, but The Schools will be opened to\nall nationalities.”2\n\n  Rather than institute race as an admissions prerequisite,\nPauahi left to her Trustees the discretion “to regulate the\nadmission of pupils” and “to make all such rules and regula-\n  2\n    Similarly, in a February 11, 1897 letter, Charles Bishop noted: “There\nis nothing in the will of Mrs. Bishop excluding white boys or girls from\nthe Schools . . . .” In a February 20, 1901 letter he further stated: “Accord-\ning to the reading of Clause 13 on Page 8 of the Will as published, the\npreference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood, applies only to\neducation of orphans and others in indigent circumstances.”\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  8929\ntions as they may deem necessary for the government” of the\nKamehameha Schools. Pauahi Bishop Will at 18. The original\ntrustees determined, however, that it was Pauahi’s intent to\nprefer students of native Hawaiian ancestry. Specifically, the\npolicy articulated by Charles Bishop was that “boys and girls\nof pure or part aboriginal blood . . . should have preference;\nthat is[,] they should have the first right.” Accordingly, the\nadmissions process at Kamehameha currently proceeds in two\nphases: first, the applicant must demonstrate that he possesses\nthe minimum qualifications necessary to meet the Schools’\nrigorous academic standards and, second, he must complete\nan “Ethnic Ancestry Survey” designed to verify his aboriginal\nblood. The Schools forthrightly admit that as long as there are\nqualified students who possess at least some native Hawaiian\nancestry, they will be admitted before even the most qualified\nof those who lack aboriginal blood. It is this “Hawaiians first”\nadmissions policy that motivates the instant controversy.\n\n   The plaintiff-appellant, John Doe, twice sought admission\nto the Kamehameha Schools and, having met the academic\nrequirements for admission, was twice determined to be a\n“competitive applicant.” After completing the Ethnic Ances-\ntry Survey, in which he acknowledged that he possessed no\naboriginal blood, his application was each time, as expected,\ndenied. Still desiring to attend the Kamehameha Schools, Doe\nfiled suit alleging that the Schools’ admissions policy violates\n42 U.S.C. § 1981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of\n1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071. Concluding that\nthe admissions policy constituted a valid race-conscious\nremedial affirmative action program, the district court entered\nsummary judgment in favor of the Kamehameha Schools and\nthe Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate. Doe v. Kamehameha Sch./\nBernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, 295 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1172\n(D. Haw. 2003). This appeal followed.\n\n                               II\n\n  Before proceeding to analyze the question presented in this\nappeal, it is worth clarifying those which are not. Specifically,\n\f8930             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nthe Kamehameha Schools does not contest, and candidly\nadmits, that its admissions process is based upon an express\nracial classification. Cf. Rice v. Cayetano, 528 U.S. 495, 514\n(2000) (“Ancestry can be a proxy for race.”). The School does\nnot attempt to justify its admissions policy by appealing to a\nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association, see Runyon\nv. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 176 (1976) (“Invidious private dis-\ncrimination may be characterized as a form of exercising free-\ndom of association protected by the First Amendment, but it\nhas never been accorded affirmative constitutional protec-\ntions.”); nor does it explicitly argue for a relaxed level of\nscrutiny by appealing to the political nature of classifications\npremised on membership in a federally recognized Indian\ntribe. See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1974) (upholding\na Bureau of Indian Affairs hiring preference for Native Amer-\nicans under rational basis scrutiny due to the unique relation-\nship between the federal government and members of\nfederally recognized Indian tribes). See also Rice, 528 U.S. at\n518 (declining to extend Mancari to uphold a race-based vot-\ning restriction for native Hawaiians absent “some beginning\npremises not yet established in [the Court’s] case law”;\nnamely, that Congress “has determined that native Hawaiians\nhave a status like that of Indians in organized tribes”). We are,\nlikewise, not presented with a challenge to the racially dis-\ncriminatory admissions policy of a public school or a school\nwhich accepts federal funding. See, e.g., Gratz v. Bollinger,\n539 U.S. 244, 275-76 & n.23 (2003) (applying strict scrutiny\nto a racial preference challenged under the Equal Protection\nClause); Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 343 (2003)\n(same).\n\n   Instead, we are confronted with a question of statutory ori-\ngin: whether a private school, receiving no federal funds, may\nlegitimately restrict admission to those of the native Hawaiian\nrace. In other words, does the Kamehameha Schools’ “Hawai-\nians first” admissions policy constitute invidious discrimina-\ntion in violation of § 1981? The district court concluded that\nit does not. Because the issue is one of law, we review that\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  8931\ndecision de novo. See, e.g., Desir v. Ilchert, 840 F.2d 723, 726\n(9th Cir. 1988) (stating that “questions concerning the\nrequirements of the applicable statutes . . . are questions of\nlaw, which we review de novo”) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n                               III\n\n   [1] Because the Kamehameha Schools admits that its\nadmissions process is premised upon an express racial classi-\nfication, we must first identify the standard of scrutiny that\nshould be applied to proffered justifications for the racially\ndiscriminatory program. Two obvious contenders exist: strict\nscrutiny, such as that used to analyze challenges brought\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause;\nor the more deferential form of scrutiny employed to resolve\nchallenges brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000(e) et seq. (2004).\n\n   If strict scrutiny applies to the plaintiff’s § 1981 challenge,\nthe Schools must demonstrate that its admissions program is\na “narrowly tailored measure[ ] that further[s] compelling\ngovernmental interests.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena,\n515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). On the other hand, if Title VII\nscrutiny applies to this § 1981 suit, the Schools must merely\n“present evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or the other\napplicant was chosen, for a legitimate nondiscriminatory rea-\nson.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 187\n(1989) (emphasis added).\n\n   The plaintiff-appellant argues that strict scrutiny is the only\nmethod of review sufficiently rigorous to enforce the substan-\ntive commands of § 1981. He urges that although the McDon-\nnell Douglas burden-shifting framework and order of proof is\nfrequently applied to § 1981 suits, Title VII’s substantive\nlegal standards are inapplicable in this context. See McDon-\nnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). We dis-\n\f8932             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nagree. To explain our disagreement, a brief preliminary\ndiscussion of the complicated history of § 1981 is useful.\n\n                               A\n\n   Section 1981 was originally enacted pursuant to section\ntwo of the Thirteenth Amendment as part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866. Act of Apr. 9, 1866, ch. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27.\n“The principal object of the legislation was to eradicate the\nBlack Codes, laws enacted by Southern legislatures imposing\na range of civil disabilities on freedmen.” Gen. Bldg. Contrac-\ntors Ass’n v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 386 (1982). Section\n1 of the Civil Rights Act provided:\n\n    That all persons born in the United States and not\n    subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not\n    taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the\n    United States; and such citizens, of every race and\n    color, without regard to any previous condition of\n    slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punish-\n    ment for crime whereof the party shall have been\n    duly convicted, shall have the same right, in every\n    State and Territory in the United States, to make and\n    enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evi-\n    dence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and con-\n    vey real and personal property, and to full and equal\n    benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security\n    of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citi-\n    zens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains,\n    and penalties, and to none other, any law, statute,\n    ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the contrary not-\n    withstanding.\n\n14 Stat. 27. In response to concerns over whether the Thir-\nteenth Amendment authorized such broad legislation, it was\nlater reenacted, after passage of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nin the Enforcement Act of 1870, sometimes referred to as the\nCivil Rights Act of 1870. Act of May 31, 1870, ch. 114,\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                    8933\n§§ 16, 18, 16 Stat. 144. See also Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24,\n32-33 (1948) (noting that some members of Congress sup-\nported the Fourteenth Amendment “in order to eliminate\ndoubt as to the constitutional validity of the Civil Rights Act\n[of 1866] as applied to the States”); Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer\nCo., 392 U.S. 409, 436 (1968) (same). The Enforcement Act\ncontained two sections which had very similar effect. Section\n18 simply reenacted, literally, § 1 of the 1866 Act:\n\n    And be it further enacted, That the act to protect all\n    persons in the United States in their civil rights, and\n    furnish the means of their vindication, passed April\n    nine, eighteen hundred and sixty-five, is hereby re-\n    enacted; and sections sixteen and seventeen hereof\n    shall be enforced according to the provisions of said\n    act.\n\n16 Stat. 141, 144 (1870). In addition, the new § 16 enacted\nmuch of the substance of the 1866 Act:\n\n    And be it further enacted, That all persons within the\n    jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\n    right in every State and Territory in the United States\n    to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties,\n    give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all\n    laws and proceedings for the security of person and\n    property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n    subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes,\n    licenses, and exactions of every kind, and none\n    other, any law, statute, ordinance, regulation or cus-\n    tom to the contrary notwithstanding. No tax or\n    charge shall be imposed or enforced by any State\n    upon any person immigrating thereto from a foreign\n    country which is not equally imposed and enforced\n    upon every person immigrating to such State from\n    any other foreign country; and any law of any State\n    in conflict with this provision is hereby declared null\n    and void.\n\f8934             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n16 Stat. 141, 144 (1870). Section 16 differed from § 1 of the\n1866 Act in at least two respects. First, where § 1 of the 1866\nAct extended its guarantees to “citizens, of every race and\ncolor,” § 16 of the 1870 Act protected “all persons.” See\nUnited States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 675 (1898);\nSagana v. Tenorio, 384 F.3d 731, 737 (9th Cir. 2004), cert.\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 1313 (2005). Second, § 16 of the 1870 Act\nomitted language contained in the 1866 Act guaranteeing\nproperty rights equivalent to those enjoyed by white citizens;\nthis language was reenacted separately in what is now 42\nU.S.C. § 1982. In 1874 federal statutory law was codified.\nSection 1977 of the Revised Code of 1874 is identical with\nthe present § 1981(a), which is prefaced by the caption “Equal\nrights under the law,” and provides the following:\n\n    All persons within the jurisdiction of the United\n    States shall have the same right in every State and\n    Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be\n    parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal ben-\n    efit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\n    persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens,\n    and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penal-\n    ties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and\n    to no other.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).\n\n   Immediately following its passage, what is now § 1981\nunderwent nearly a century of desuetude during which debate\nregarding its scope and meaning was generally subsumed by\nthe controversy surrounding the newly ratified Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Partially owing to lin-\ngering uncertainty regarding the scope of the statute and the\nextent of Congress’s authority to prohibit discrimination\ndivorced from state action, § 1981 would not gain indepen-\ndent significance until the late 1960s. See, e.g., Hurd, 334\nU.S. at 31 (declaring that “governmental action” was required\nin a suit based on the Civil Rights Act of 1866); The Civil\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  8935\nRights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 24-25 (1883) (invalidating the pub-\nlic accommodation provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875\nas beyond Congress’s power to enforce either the Thirteenth\nor Fourteenth Amendments). With two decisions, however,\nthe Supreme Court did for § 1981 what Monroe v. Pape, 365\nU.S. 167 (1961), did for 42 U.S.C. § 1983: clarify and resur-\nrect the statute from its prior existence, merely as a device to\naugment the remedies for previously recognized forms of dis-\ncrimination, to a litigation tool in its own right with unparal-\nleled theoretical coverage. See Runyon, 427 U.S. at 170;\nJones, 392 U.S. at 423.\n\n   In Jones, the Court interpreted a companion statute, 42\nU.S.C. § 1982, to encompass and prohibit racial discrimina-\ntion in purely private transactions. 392 U.S. at 423-24. The\nCourt held that the right conferred by § 1982 — the same\nright to “inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real\nand personal property” as is enjoyed by white citizens — is\nsecured against interference from both governmental and pri-\nvate actions. Id. (“[W]hen Congress provided in § 1 of the\nCivil Rights Act that the right to purchase and lease property\nwas to be enjoyed equally throughout the United States by\nNegro and white citizens alike, it plainly meant to secure that\nright against interference from any source whatever, whether\ngovernmental or private.”). Thus, relying on the legislative\nhistory of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Court con-\ncluded that Congress intended to prohibit “all racial discrimi-\nnation, private and public, in the sale . . . of property,” id. at\n437, and, further, that this prohibition was within Congress’s\npower under section two of the Thirteenth Amendment “ratio-\nnally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of\nslavery, and . . . to translate that determination into effective\nlegislation.” Id. at 440. Eight years later, in Runyon, the Court\nexplicitly found the same result dictated under § 1981.\n\n   Runyon involved a challenge to two private schools’ admis-\nsions programs which categorically excluded African-\nAmerican students. 427 U.S. at 170. Although the schools\n\f8936             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nreceived no federal or state aid of any kind, their services\n“were advertised and offered to members of the general pub-\nlic.” Id. at 172. Relying on Jones and two other recent cases,\nsee Johnson v. Ry. Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 459-\n60 (1975); Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass’n, 410\nU.S. 431, 439-40 (1973), the Court concluded that an individ-\nual’s § 1981 right “to make and enforce contracts” is violated\nif a private offeror refuses to extend him “the same opportu-\nnity to enter into contracts” that he extends to white offerees,\nsolely on the basis of his race. Runyon, 427 U.S. at 170-71.\nAccording to the Court, the schools’ racially exclusive admis-\nsions policies constituted “a classic violation of § 1981.” Id.\nat 172. The Court found that since it is derived from both the\nActs of 1866 and 1870, § 1981 validly reaches private, as well\nas public, racial discrimination based upon Congress’s Thir-\nteenth Amendment powers. Id. at 168 n.8, 179 (“Section\n1981, as applied to the conduct at issue here, constitutes a[ ]\n[valid] exercise of federal legislative power under § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment . . . .”).\n\n   Thus, together, and more than one hundred years after\n§ 1981’s passage, Jones and Runyon finally dispensed with\nthe state action requirement and held that the Civil Rights Act\nof 1866 reached purely private acts of discrimination by vir-\ntue of Congress’s power under section two of the Thirteenth\nAmendment. How far the Thirteenth Amendment enforce-\nment power and the doctrine of Runyon extended, however,\nremained open.\n\n   In the same term that it decided Runyon, the Court held that\n§ 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment\nagainst white persons as well as nonwhite persons. McDonald\nv. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 295 (1976)\n(“Th[e] cumulative evidence of congressional intent makes\nclear, we think, that the 1866 statute, designed to protect the\n‘same right . . . to make and enforce contracts’ of ‘citizens of\nevery race and color’ was not understood or intended to be\nreduced . . . to the protection solely of nonwhites.”). McDon-\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                    8937\nald involved a claim by two white employees of the Santa Fe\nTrail Transportation Company who were accused of misap-\npropriating company property; the company had also accused\nan African-American employee of the same offense. Shortly\nthereafter, the two white employees were fired, but the\nAfrican-American employee was not. Believing their termina-\ntion to be racially-based, the two white employees filed suit\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and § 1981\nalleging unlawful employment discrimination. To resolve the\ndispute, the Court had to address whether § 1981 encom-\npassed discrimination against white persons. Reasoning that\nCongress’s broad language evinced an intent “to proscribe\ndiscrimination in the making or enforcement of contracts\nagainst, or in favor of, any race,” the Court observed:\n\n    Unlikely as it might have appeared in 1866 that\n    white citizens would encounter substantial racial dis-\n    crimination of the sort proscribed under the Act, the\n    statutory structure and legislative history persuade us\n    that the 39th Congress was intent upon establishing\n    in the federal law a broader principle than would\n    have been necessary simply to meet the particular\n    and immediate plight of the newly freed Negro\n    slaves.\n\nId. at 295-96.\n\n   Without clarifying the source of Congress’s power to enact\na law that prohibited private race discrimination against\nwhites, the Court in McDonald declined to restrict § 1981 to\nclaims only by African-Americans. By avoiding the constitu-\ntional questions implicated by its broad reading of the statute,\nthe Court left unresolved whether Congress’s power to pro-\nhibit discrimination against white persons in private employ-\nment also emanated from § 1981’s Thirteenth Amendment\norigins or whether it might be based on some other source;\nparticularly, Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.\nBecause the Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company was also\n\f8938                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nsubject to the requirements of Title VII — a statute whose\ncapacity to regulate private conduct has been squarely located\nin the Commerce Clause, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000a; United\nSteelworkers of Am. v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 206 n.6 (1979)\n(“Title VII . . . was enacted pursuant to the commerce power\nto regulate purely private decisionmaking”) — it is question-\nable whether we can read McDonald as recognizing the Thir-\nteenth Amendment as the source of Congress’s power to\nprohibit all private discrimination against whites. Nonethe-\nless, later cases have assumed, without discussion, that Con-\ngress does possess the power to prohibit a private school from\ndiscriminating against non-African-Americans on the basis of\nrace. See, e.g., Saint Francis Coll. v. Al-Khazraji, 481 U.S.\n604, 609-10 (1987) (permitting suit under § 1981 by professor\nof Arabian ancestry against a private university); cf. Gen.\nBldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 390 n.17 (“We need not decide\nwhether the Thirteenth Amendment itself . . . accomplished\nanything more than the abolition of slavery.”); City of Mem-\nphis v. Greene, 451 U.S. 100, 125-26 (1981) (leaving open\nthe question of whether § 1 of the Thirteenth Amendment did\nanything more than abolish slavery). Whether it stems from\na broad reading of section two of the Thirteenth Amendment,\nor a similarly broad reading of the Commerce Clause, Con-\ngress’s power to prohibit private race discrimination has not\nyet been seriously questioned.3\n  3\n   The parties have not contested the constitutionality of § 1981 as\napplied to the discriminatory admissions policy in place at the Kameha-\nmeha Schools. Although we note the constitutional questions that are\nimplicated, we decline to restrict McDonald to its context, in part, because\nof the alternative constitutional concerns that a “racial minorities only”\nreading of § 1981 would raise. See, e.g., Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227 (“[A]ll\nracial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local govern-\nmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scruti-\nny.”); Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 367 (1978)\n(Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part)\n(“To the extent that Congress acted under the Commerce Clause power,”\nwhen enacting Title VII, “it was restricted in the use of race in govern-\nmental decisionmaking by the equal protection component of the Due Pro-\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         8939\n   After Jones, Runyon and McDonald, the theoretical cover-\nage of § 1981 appeared almost limitless. In the cases that fol-\nlowed, however, the Court endeavored to define the outer\nbounds of, as well as the burdens of proof applicable to,\n§ 1981 race discrimination claims. In General Building Con-\ntractors, the Court emphasized the statute’s Fourteenth\nAmendment origins to hold “that § 1981, like the Equal Pro-\ntection Clause, can be violated only by purposeful discrimina-\ntion.” 458 U.S. at 391. The Court’s decision foreclosed claims\npremised on disparate impact, claims which are actionable\nunder Title VII. See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424,\n431 (1971).\n\n   Seven years later, the Court revisited the relationship\nbetween Title VII and § 1981. In Patterson v. McLean Credit\nUnion, an African-American former employee of the McLean\nCredit Union brought a § 1981 suit against her employer,\nclaiming racial harassment, failure to promote, and discharge\non account of her race. 491 U.S. 164 (1989), superseded by\nstatute on other grounds as stated in Estate of Reynolds v.\nMartin, 985 F.2d 470, 475 n.2 (9th Cir. 1993). The district\ncourt determined that a claim for racial harassment is not\nactionable under § 1981, and the court of appeals affirmed.\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari, in part, to decide\nwhether a claim for racial harassment “falls within one of the\nenumerated rights protected by § 1981.” Id. at 176.4 The\n\ncess Clause of the Fifth Amendment”). Accordingly, and until either\nCongress or the Supreme Court indicates otherwise, we assume for pur-\nposes of our remaining analysis that Congress possesses the constitutional\nauthority to prohibit race discrimination both against and in favor of white\npersons in private schools.\n   4\n     After oral argument, however, the Court requested the parties to brief\nand argue an additional question: “Whether or not the interpretation of 42\nU.S.C. § 1981 adopted by [the] Court in Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160\n(1976), should be reconsidered.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 485\nU.S. 617, 617 (1988) (per curiam). See also Patterson, 491 U.S. at 170-\n171. Concluding that no special justification warranting a departure from\nthe doctrine of stare decisis had been shown, the Court declined to over-\nrule Runyon. Id. at 175 (“We decline to overrule Runyon and acknowledge\nthat its holding remains the governing law in this area.”).\n\f8940             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nCourt held that it does not; rather, § 1981 is limited by its\nterms to prohibiting discrimination in the making and enforc-\ning of contracts, and does not extend to “postformation con-\nduct,” or problems that may arise later from the terms and\nconditions of continuing employment. Id. at 177-80. Examin-\ning the petitioner’s failure-to-promote claim, the Court con-\ncluded that the district court erred by instructing the jury that\nthe petitioner had to prove that she was better qualified than\nthe white employee who allegedly received the promotion. Id.\nat 186. Drawing from Title VII case law, the Court took this\nopportunity to clarify the framework for analyzing a § 1981\nclaim against a private employer:\n\n    We have developed, in analogous areas of civil\n    rights law, a carefully designed framework of proof\n    to determine, in the context of disparate treatment,\n    the ultimate issue whether the defendant intention-\n    ally discriminated against the plaintiff. See Texas\n    Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248\n    (1981); McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n    U.S. 792 (1973). We agree with the Court of\n    Appeals that this scheme of proof, structured as a\n    “sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in\n    light of common experience as it bears on the critical\n    question of discrimination,” Furnco Construction\n    Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978), should\n    apply to claims of racial discrimination under\n    § 1981.\n\nId. at 186. Having imported Title VII’s McDonnell Douglas\norder of proof, the Court elaborated to explain, in detailed\nfashion, the specific evidentiary showings required:\n\n    Under our well-established framework, the plaintiff\n    has the initial burden of proving, by a preponderance\n    of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination.\n    . . . Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case,\n    an inference of discrimination arises. In order to\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                    8941\n    rebut this inference, the employer must present evi-\n    dence that the plaintiff was rejected, or the other\n    applicant was chosen, for a legitimate nondiscrimi-\n    natory reason. . . . At this point, as our prior cases\n    make clear, petitioner retains the final burden of per-\n    suading the jury of intentional discrimination.\n    Although petitioner retains the ultimate burden of\n    persuasion, our cases make clear that she must also\n    have the opportunity to demonstrate that respon-\n    dent’s proffered reasons for its decision were not its\n    true reasons.\n\nId. at 186-87 (internal quotation marks, citations and footnote\nomitted) (emphasis added).\n\n   [2] We find this treatment particularly instructive because\nthe Court’s discussion appears to approve the use of, in the\narena of § 1981 employment discrimination claims, not only\nthe McDonnell Douglas order of proof, but also the nature of\nthe proof that a private defendant in a Title VII action is\nrequired to adduce. See also Olmstead v. L.C. ex rel. Zimring,\n527 U.S. 581, 617 n.1 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (“This\nCourt has applied the ‘framework’ developed in Title VII\ncases to claims brought under [§ 1981].”) (citing Patterson,\n491 U.S. at 186); Whidbee v. Garzarelli Food Specialties,\nInc., 223 F.3d 62, 69 (2d Cir. 2000) (analogizing a § 1981\nclaim to a Title VII claim); Brown v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,\n939 F.2d 946, 949 (11th Cir. 1991) (“[T]he test for intentional\ndiscrimination in suits under § 1981 is the same as the formu-\nlation used in Title VII discriminatory treatment causes. . . .\n[T]he defendant must come forward with evidence demon-\nstrating legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its con-\nduct.”). While the Court could have suggested that a § 1981\ndefendant must demonstrate that race-based action is nar-\nrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest,\nsee, e.g., Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, it stated instead that the\nemployer must show merely “that the plaintiff was rejected,\nor the other applicant was chosen, for a legitimate nondis-\n\f8942             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ncriminatory reason,” Patterson, 491 U.S. at 187 (emphasis\nadded).\n\n   The appellant aptly notes that use of the McDonnell Doug-\nlas burden-shifting framework does not necessarily, or even\nusually, signify that Title VII’s substantive standard of scru-\ntiny — in particular, the requirement that the defendant “pre-\nsent evidence that the plaintiff was rejected . . . for a legiti-\nmate nondiscriminatory reason” — also governs. Patterson,\n491 U.S. at 187 (emphasis added). The appellant points out\nthat at least one court has made the McDonnell Douglas\nburden-shifting framework available to plaintiffs who must\nprove intentional discrimination in order to make out a viola-\ntion of the Equal Protection Clause. See English v. Colo.\nDep’t of Corr., 248 F.3d 1002, 1007 (10th Cir. 2001)\n(employing the McDonnell Douglas framework to analyze\n§ 1983 claim alleging a violation of the Equal Protection\nClause by the Colorado Department of Corrections); cf. St.\nMary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506 n.1 (1993)\n(assuming, absent objection from the parties, that it was per-\nmissible for the lower court to apply the McDonnell Douglas\nframework to the plaintiff’s equal protection claim as well as\nhis Title VII claim); Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Henderson,\n940 F.2d 465, 472 & n.14 (9th Cir. 1991) (declining to decide\nwhether McDonnell Douglas is the appropriate framework for\nanalyzing an equal protection claim). Nonetheless, the Patter-\nson Court specifically found that the district court, while cor-\nrectly recognizing that the Title VII “scheme of proof should\napply in § 1981 cases,” erred in “describing the petitioner’s\nburden.” Patterson, 491 U.S. at 186. We find the Court’s\ncomplete description of the burden — setting forth both the\norder of proof and the nature of the proof required — to be\nthe best indication from the Supreme Court as to how lower\ncourts should shape the contours of a § 1981 challenge to a\nprivate entity’s racially discriminatory practice.\n\n   In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress amended the stat-\nute specifically to overrule Patterson’s holding that § 1981\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                          8943\ndoes not extend to postformation conduct. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(b) (defining the phrase “make and enforce contracts”\nto include “the making, performance, modification, and termi-\nnation of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privi-\nleges, terms and conditions of the contractual relationship”).\nThe amended statute also clarified any residual doubt as to\nCongress’s intention that § 1981 apply to private discrimina-\ntion: “[t]he rights protected by this section are protected\nagainst impairment by nongovernmental discrimination.” 42\nU.S.C. § 1981(c). Importantly, nothing in the amended statute\ncalls into question Patterson’s discussion of the McDonnell\nDouglas proof structure or the nature of proof required in a\n§ 1981 suit against a private entity.\n\n   [3] Although the question has never been squarely presented,5\nwe read the Court’s decisions both in Patterson and in Gen-\neral Building Contractors to indicate a willingness to look to\nthe Fourteenth Amendment as a means for restricting liability\nto the types of racially motivated practices that led Congress\nto enact § 1981 — namely, intentional discrimination on the\nbasis of race — but to look to Title VII jurisprudence to clar-\nify the order and nature of the proof. See also City of\n  5\n    Before Patterson the decisions of our court frequently assumed, with-\nout discussion, that both the nature and the order of proof applicable to\nTitle VII claims also applied to claims brought under § 1981. See Jurado\nv. Eleven-Fifty Corp., 813 F.2d 1406, 1412 (9th Cir. 1987) (“The same\nstandards apply [to claims brought under Title VII and those brought\nunder § 1981], and facts sufficient to give rise to a Title VII claim are also\nsufficient for a section 1981 claim.”); EEOC v. Inland Marine Indus., 729\nF.2d 1229, 1233 n.7 (9th Cir. 1984) (“A plaintiff must meet the same stan-\ndards in proving a § 1981 claim that he must meet in establishing a . . .\nclaim under Title VII[.]”). See also Berger v. Iron Workers Reinforced\nRodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1412 n.7 (D.C. Cir.) (per curiam)\n(“The standards and order of proof in section 1981 cases have been held\nto be identical to those governing Title VII disparate treatment cases.”),\nclarified on reh’g, 852 F.2d 619 (D.C. Cir. 1988). We have never explic-\nitly considered whether Title VII’s requirement that the defendant come\nforward with a “legitimate nondiscriminatory reason” also applies in the\n§ 1981 context.\n\f8944                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nMemphis, 451 U.S. at 126 (finding § 1982 inapplicable where\n“the record discloses no racially discriminatory motive” but\ninstead “demonstrates that the interests that did motivate the\n[defendant] are legitimate”).\n\n   Contrary to the appellant’s argument, we do not find the\nCourt’s recent decisions in the “Michigan Affirmative Action\nCases” relevant to our analysis. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343\n(concluding that the University of Michigan Law School’s\nadmissions program satisfied strict scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause and, therefore, that it also satisfied Title VI\nand § 1981); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 275-76 n.23 (concluding that\nthe University of Michigan’s undergraduate admissions pro-\ngram failed strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause\nand, therefore, that it also violated Title VI and § 1981). Aside\nfrom the fact that both cases involved a challenge to a public\nuniversity’s use of racial preferences in admissions, neither\ncase presented the Court with an occasion to address, at any\nlength, the appropriate standard of scrutiny for a § 1981 chal-\nlenge. Because the preference in Grutter satisfied strict scru-\ntiny, it necessarily would satisfy a lower standard; as the\npreference in Gratz failed strict scrutiny, the invalidity of the\nuniversity’s admissions program rendered it unnecessary for\nthe Court to consider whether it could satisfy a lower standard.6\nThe appellant relies, however, on the Court’s citation, in\nGrutter, to General Building Contractors, which is followed\nby the parenthetical note, “the prohibition against discrimina-\ntion in § 1981 is co-extensive with the Equal Protection\nClause.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343 (citing Gen. Bldg. Contrac-\ntors, 458 U.S. at 389-91). The Court in Gratz similarly\ndropped a footnote citing General Building Contractors for\nthe proposition that “purposeful discrimination that violates\n  6\n    We find our recent decision in Sagana inapplicable for the same reason\nthat we find the Supreme Court’s decision in Grutter irrelevant to the facts\nof this appeal. See Sagana, 384 F.3d at 743 (concluding that a challenged\ngovernmental employment policy that satisfied Fourteenth Amendment\nscrutiny necessarily also satisfied scrutiny under § 1981).\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8945\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nwill also violate § 1981.” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23 (citing\nGen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 389-90). See also\nSagana, 384 F.3d at 743.\n\n   Mindful of the inherent dangers of according undue weight\nto isolated statements from decisions not directly on point, we\nread these parenthetical notes simply as recognizing that both\nthe Equal Protection Clause and § 1981 require a showing of\nintentional discrimination; they are co-extensive on this point.\nThe Court’s decision in Patterson incorporated this holding,\nseven years after General Building Contractors, when it\ninstructed lower courts to apply the McDonnell Douglas\nframework to claims of racial discrimination in employment\nbrought under § 1981, while noting that the “petitioner retains\nthe final burden of persuading the jury of intentional discrimi-\nnation.” Patterson, 491 U.S. at 187 (emphasis added). Simply\nput, the Supreme Court’s parenthetical notations in Grutter\nand Gratz should be read in light of the specific import of the\ncited case, and General Building Contractors does nothing\nmore than specify that intentional discrimination must be\nestablished in order to sustain both an equal protection and a\n§ 1981 challenge. Although, like the Fourteenth Amendment,\n§ 1981 reaches only intentional discrimination, § 1981 is not\notherwise co-extensive with the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n   From the historical context in which it was passed as well\nas the cases interpreting its command, we are persuaded that\n§ 1981, like Title VII, “was not intended to incorporate and\nparticularize the commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments,” Weber, 443 U.S. at 206 n.6, nor was it\nintended to apply those commands to private sector discrimi-\nnation. For this reason, we conclude that § 1981 should not be\nread in pari materia with the Fourteenth Amendment to\nrequire the application of strict scrutiny to all private race-\nbased preferences. See id. (declining to read Title VII and\nTitle VI in pari materia); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630 n.8 (not-\ning Congress’s “desire to preserve a relatively large domain\n\f8946               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nfor voluntary employer action”). In sum, having generally\nabandoned, after Runyon and Jones, the Fourteenth Amend-\nment as the model for interpreting, and limiting the reach of,\n§§ 1981 and 1982, we conclude that the substantive standards\nembodied in modern civil rights laws better capture the juris-\nprudence of § 1981.\n\n   [4] Although the instant case involves a § 1981 claim\nagainst a private school, we find no reason to depart from the\nstandards outlined in Patterson and well-established in the\ncases interpreting Title VII. While the analysis necessarily\nmust be modified in order to account for differences of con-\ntext, the substantive guarantee should remain the same: the\nright to make and enforce contracts free from illegitimate and\nunlawful discrimination on the basis of race. Accordingly, we\nhold that a § 1981 suit against a purely private school is gov-\nerned by the substantive standards applicable to race-based\nchallenges brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. This means that once the § 1981 plaintiff estab-\nlishes a prima facie case of intentional race discrimination, the\ndefendant must come forward with a legitimate nondiscrimi-\nnatory reason justifying the challenged practice; if such a rea-\nson is offered the plaintiff may still attempt to show that the\nreason is a pretext for unlawful race discrimination.\n\n   It remains to clarify how these standards should operate in\nthe context of private education.\n\n                                  B\n\n   Under the proof structure and accompanying substantive\nstandards that we now import, the complainant in a § 1981\nsuit against a purely private school must carry the initial bur-\nden of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\nSee McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.7 Where an explicit\n  7\n   As is true with respect to the application of the McDonnell Douglas\nproof structure in the context of Title VII employment discrimination\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                          8947\nrace-based admissions policy exists, proof of this fact alone\nis sufficient to establish a prima facie case.\n\n   If the plaintiff proves his prima facie case, a rebuttable pre-\nsumption of intentional discrimination arises, see Tex. Dep’t\nof Comty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981), and\nthe burden of production shifts to the school to articulate a\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its admissions policy.\nSee McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. See also Burdine,\n450 U.S. at 255-56. If the school satisfies this burden, the bur-\nden of production again shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the\nschool’s articulated reason is a pretext for unlawful race dis-\ncrimination. See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 515-16; McDonnell Doug-\nlas, 411 U.S. at 804. Despite the shifting burdens, the ultimate\nburden of persuasion that the school intentionally discrimi-\nnated on the basis of race remains with the plaintiff at all\ntimes. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 507.\n\n   We turn, next, to the task of applying these standards to the\nplaintiff-appellant’s § 1981 challenge to the racially exclu-\nsionary admissions policy in place at the Kamehameha\nSchools.\n\n                                     IV\n\n   It is undisputed that the Kamehameha Schools employs an\nexpress racial classification designed to deny admission to all\nstudents possessing no aboriginal blood, so long as qualified\nnative Hawaiian applicants seek admission in sufficient num-\nber to fill the positions.8 Accordingly, the issue becomes\n\nclaims, the elements of a prima facie case will vary depending on the par-\nticular facts involved. See McDonald, 427 U.S. at 279 n.6 (“ ‘specification\n. . . of the prima facie proof required . . . is not necessarily applicable in\nevery respect to differing factual situations’ ”) (quoting McDonnell Doug-\nlas, 411 U.S. at 802 n.13).\n   8\n     Appellees argue that the racial preference is not an absolute bar to the\nadmission of non-Hawaiians because if spaces exceed the number of qual-\n\f8948                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nwhether the Schools can articulate a legitimate nondiscrimina-\ntory reason justifying this racial preference. Toward this end,\nthe Schools urge that its policy constitutes a valid affirmative\naction plan rationally related to redressing present imbalances\nin the socioeconomic and educational achievement of native\nHawaiians, producing native Hawaiian leadership for commu-\nnity involvement, and revitalizing native Hawaiian culture.\n\n   [5] The Supreme Court has held that Title VII’s prohibition\nagainst racial discrimination “does not condemn all private,\nvoluntary, race-conscious affirmative action plans.” Weber,\n443 U.S. at 208. Consequently, in the Title VII context, if the\nchallenged employment decision was made pursuant to such\na plan, the existence of an affirmative action plan itself can\nform the basis of a legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale. See\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 626. We assume, absent objection from\nthe parties, that the same principle applies to a § 1981 suit\nagainst a purely private school. See, e.g., Edmonson v. United\nStates Steel Corp., 659 F.2d 582, 584 (5th Cir. 1981) (per\ncuriam) (applying Title VII standards in the context of § 1981\nemployment discrimination challenge to race-conscious affir-\nmative action plan); accord Setser v. Novack Inv. Co., 657\nF.2d 962, 966-68 (8th Cir. 1981) (en banc), cert. denied, 454\nU.S. 1064 (1981); cf. McDonald, 427 U.S. at 280 n.8 (declin-\ning to consider the permissibility, under § 1981, of an affirma-\ntive action program).\n\n   [6] As a preliminary matter, we note that the plaintiff gen-\nerally bears the burden of establishing the invalidity of an\n\nified native Hawaiian applicants, Kamehameha will admit non-Hawaiian\nstudents. They point out that, in 2003, a non-Hawaiian student was admit-\nted to the Kamehameha Schools; a fact which, the record suggests, owed\nmore to accident than design as it prompted an immediate full-scale inves-\ntigation and promise, on the part of School administrators, to ensure that\nadmission remained for native Hawaiians only. Whether or not the policy\nis, in the abstract, an absolute bar to admission for those of the non-\npreferred race, it certainly operates as one.\n\f                  DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                   8949\naffirmative action plan challenged under Title VII. See John-\nson, 480 U.S. at 626 (“If [an affirmative action] plan is articu-\nlated as the basis for the [challenged employment] decision,\nthe burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the employer’s\njustification is pretextual and the plan is invalid.”); cf. Hill v.\nRoss, 183 F.3d 586, 590 (7th Cir. 1999) (noting that John-\nson’s discussion of burdens was undermined by subsequent\ndecisions, but declining to decide whether it survived those\ndecisions); Bass v. Bd. of County Comm’rs, 256 F.3d 1095,\n1115 (11th Cir. 2001) (same). We see no basis for a different\nrule regarding a plan’s alleged violation of § 1981 in the con-\ntext of private education. Our remaining analysis, therefore,\nwill focus on determining whether the plaintiff-appellant has\nmet this burden.\n\n                                A\n\n   The starting point for our analysis is the Court’s seminal\ndecision in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, 443\nU.S. 193 (1979). At issue in Weber was an affirmative action\nplan collectively bargained by a union and an employer that\nreserved for African-American employees fifty percent of the\nopenings in an in-plant craft training program. In ruling that\nthe challenged plan fell on the permissible side of the line\ndemarcating valid affirmative action plans from those which\nviolate the commands of Title VII, the Court observed that the\npurpose of the plan mirrored that of Title VII: to “break down\nold patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy” and to\n“ ‘open employment opportunities for [minorities] in occupa-\ntions which have been traditionally closed to them.’ ” Id. at\n208 (citing and quoting 110 CONG. REC. 6548 (1964) (remarks\nof Sen. Humphrey)). It emphasized that the plan did so with-\nout “unnecessarily trammel[ing] the interests of the white\nemployees”; specifically, the plan did not “require the dis-\ncharge of white workers and their replacement with new black\nhirees,” and did not “create an absolute bar to the advance-\nment of white employees.” Id. Finally, the Court noted that\n“the plan is a temporary measure; it is not intended to main-\n\f8950                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ntain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest racial\nimbalance.” Id.9\n\n   While “[t]he Weber Court did not establish a rigid formula\nfor testing the validity of an affirmative action plan,” Johnson\nv. Transp. Agency, 770 F.2d 752, 757 (9th Cir. 1984); see also\nSetser, 657 F.2d at 969-70, later cases have used Weber as a\ngeneral guide for assessing the legality of affirmative action\nplans challenged pursuant to Title VII. See, e.g., Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 627 (“The assessment of the legality of the [affirma-\ntive action plan in question] must be guided by our decision\nin Weber.”); Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers Int’l Ass’n v.\nEEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 479 (1986) (applying Weber and find-\ning that a court-imposed union membership goal and fund\nestablished to increase minority enrollment, which did not\n“require any member of the union to be laid off,” “discrimi-\nnate against existing union members,” nor bar admission of\nwhite applicants to the union, did not “unnecessarily tram-\nmel[ ] the interests of white employees”). We are persuaded\nthat these general principles may be rationally applied in the\ncontext of private education, with certain modifications to\naccount for the differences of context.\n\n   [7] We recently distilled the Court’s analysis in Weber into\nthree distinct requirements: affirmative action plans must (1)\nrespond to a manifest imbalance in its work force; (2) not\n“ ‘create[ ] an absolute bar to the[ ] advancement’ ” of the\nnon-preferred race or “ ‘unnecessarily trammel[ ]’ ” their\nrights; and (3) do no more than is necessary to achieve a bal-\nance. Rudebusch v. Hughes, 313 F.3d 506, 520-21 (9th Cir.\n2002) (quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 637-38). The appellant\nclaims that the Schools’ program fails under the first of these\ncriteria: rather than addressing a manifest internal imbalance,\n  9\n   Under the plan, the preference was slated to end as soon as the percent-\nage of minority skilled craftworkers approximated the percentage of\nminorities in the local labor force. Weber, 443 U.S. at 208-09.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8951\nit seeks to address an imbalance external to its student popula-\ntion.\n\n   [8] We do not address the appellant’s claims because we\nfind the second of Weber’s guiding principles fatal to the pro-\ngram in place at the Kamehameha Schools. The school’s\nadmission policy operates as an absolute bar to admission for\nnon-Hawaiians. Kamehameha’s unconditional refusal to\nadmit non-Hawaiians so long as there are native Hawaiian\napplicants categorically “trammels” the rights of non-\nHawaiians. The Court in Runyon made clear that an admis-\nsions policy that consciously and conspicuously denies admis-\nsion to all members of the non-preferred race on account of\ntheir race is “a classic violation of § 1981.” 427 U.S. at 172.\n\n   Appellees argue, nonetheless, that the need is so great that\nthe Schools should be permitted to admit only native Hawai-\nians until the educational deficits affecting that community\ndisappear. They present abundant evidence demonstrating that\nnative Hawaiians are over-represented in negative socioeco-\nnomic statistics such as poverty, homelessness, child abuse\nand neglect, and criminal activity; they are more likely to live\nin economically disadvantaged neighborhoods and attend\nlow-quality schools; and, because of low levels of educational\nattainment, they are severely under-represented in profes-\nsional and managerial positions, and over-represented in low-\npaying service and labor occupations. In sum, they urge, even\nthough the admissions policy creates an “absolute bar,” it is\nnecessary for the Schools to “trammel” the interests of non-\naboriginal applicants in order to reach its goal.\n\n   [9] To accept this argument, however, is to completely\nabolish what we perceive to be an important limitation\nembodied in Weber’s second principle: fairness to applicants\nof the non-preferred race. Even if we assumed that some, lim-\nited racial preferences might be appropriate in order for the\nSchools to advance its mission, an absolute bar on the basis\nof race alone exceeds any reasonable application of Weber,\n\f8952             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nRudebusch, and the cases that followed in their wake. “Classi-\nfications of [persons] solely on the basis of race . . . threaten\nto stigmatize individuals by reason of their membership in a\nracial group and to incite racial hostility.” Shaw v. Reno, 509\nU.S. 630, 643 (1993). Indeed, the sub-text to the Schools’ pol-\nicy — that of all those who are found in poverty, homeless-\nness, crime and other socially or economically disadvantaged\ncircumstances, only native Hawaiians count — “perpetuate[s]\nthe notion that race matters most” and “ ‘may exacerbate the\nvery [conditions that Kamehameha’s policy is intended] to\ncounteract.’ ” Johnson v. California, 125 S. Ct. 1141, 1143\n(2005) (quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 648). As we emphasized\nin Coral Construction Co. v. King County, “race conscious\nprograms must be designed to minimize — if not avoid —\nburdens upon nonculpable third parties.” 941 F.2d 910, 917\n(9th Cir. 1991). We cannot agree with the district court’s con-\nclusion that the challenged program constitutes a valid affir-\nmative action plan supplying a legitimate nondiscriminatory\nreason for the Schools’ racially exclusionary admissions pol-\nicy. Under the principles we find controlling, the Schools’\nabsolute bar to admission on the basis of race is invalid.\n\n                               B\n\n   Appellees urge that Congress’s intent is essential to guiding\nour interpretation of how § 1981 applies to a particular set of\nfacts. They argue that because Congress has given native\nHawaiians in general, and the Kamehameha Schools in partic-\nular, preferences in the context of education, see 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7901 et seq.; 20 U.S.C. § 7511 et seq., our analysis must\nharmonize these enactments by according the Schools greater\ndeference under § 1981. Appellees argue that it is inconceiv-\nable that the same Congress that enacted preferences for\nnative Hawaiians would think that the Schools preferences\nviolate § 1981; additionally, they argue that we can give\n§ 1981 this more generous reading because § 1981 was\namended in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         8953\n   We have located no authority for the proposition that con-\ngressional intent, as manifested by scattered statutes adopted\nspecially for the benefit of native Hawaiians, is sufficient to\nmodify the standards embodied in a statute of general applica-\nbility. We cannot imagine the task of trying to harmonize all\nof the various acts of Congress — a prodigious output that is\never expanding and contracting — with statutes of general\napplicability such as § 1981.10 Congress is quite capable of\ncreating exceptions for such laws, and we would intrude on\nits ability or willingness to do so if we scoured the U.S. Code\nfor hints of contrary intent. For reasons both of separation of\npowers and our own sanity, we will not undertake such a task.\nRather, our role, in the context of § 1981, “is limited to inter-\npreting what Congress may do and has done.” Patterson, 491\nU.S. at 188.\n\n   Judge GRABER, in dissent, urges us to consider 20 U.S.C.\n§ 4905(a) (1991) (repealed 1994) as evidence of Congress’s\nintent to abrogate the otherwise plain language of § 1981 as\nit applies to the Kamehameha Schools’ racially exclusionary\nadmissions policy. We are told that because the now repealed\n§ 4905(a) authorized grants to the Kamehameha Schools to\ndevelop a demonstration program to support native Hawaiians\nwho choose to attend college, it follows as an “inescapable\nconclusion” that Congress intends the Schools to refuse to\nadmit, into its K-12 program, anyone without aboriginal\nblood. Dissent, at 8966. Even assuming, arguendo, the prem-\nise that § 1981 may affect parties differently when Congress\nso directs, we cannot agree that a statute adopted in 1988 and\nrepealed in 1994 created a native Hawaiian carve-out for\n§ 1981.11\n  10\n     This is particularly true when we deal with a statute of such venerable\nprovenance as § 1981, one that long pre-dates Congress’s more recent\nnative Hawaiian preferences.\n  11\n     Reading § 4905(a) to authorize exclusive racial preferences for native\nHawaiians in education may raise constitutional problems in light of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Rice. See Rice, 528 U.S. at 518 (declining to\n\f8954                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   Over the years, Congress has directed research, support and\nassistance at numerous minority groups, as well as the cate-\ngory of “minorities” in general. See, e.g., Minority Access to\nResearch Careers Program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 241, 285k, 288,\n288a (1988); Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship Program,\nPub.L. 99-498, Title IX, § 901(a), Oct. 17, 1986, 100 Stat.\n1550 (repealed Pub.L. 105-244, Title VII, § 702, Oct. 7, 1998,\n112 Stat. 1803); Excellence in Mathematics, Science and\nEngineering Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-589, 104 Stat. 2881\n(1990); African-American History Landmark Theme Study,\nPub.L. 102-98, Aug. 17, 1991, 105 Stat. 485 (1991). But it\nwould be overreaching to interpret these statutes as blanket\napproval for private race discrimination that is otherwise vio-\nlative of § 1981. So far as we are aware, Congress has never\neven considered the racial bar to admission in place at the\nKamehameha Schools, and we cannot infer implicit approval\nfrom a statute that merely authorized financial support for\ncollege-bound native Hawaiians. Thus, while we agree with\nthe dissent that we should read statutes capable of co-\nexistence “to give effect to each,” we find no conflict between\n§ 4905(a), which authorizes federal financial assistance to\npromote native Hawaiian higher education, and § 1981, which\nforbids a private institution from erecting an absolute bar to\nadmission or advancement solely on the basis of race. Watt v.\nAlaska, 451 U.S. 259, 267 (1981).\n\n  Importantly, we find little to suggest that Congress, in\nenacting the Civil Rights Act of 1991, intended to do anything\n\nuphold a race-based voting restriction for native Hawaiians absent “some\nbeginning premises not yet established in [the Court’s] case law[;]”\nnamely, that Congress “has determined that native Hawaiians have a status\nlike that of Indians in organized tribes”). If Congress’s classifications\nbased on native Hawaiian status are, indeed, of a racial nature, they may\nfall subject to strict scrutiny under the equal protection component of the\nFifth Amendment. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227 (“[A]ll racial classifica-\ntions, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor,\nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.”).\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8955\nmore than overrule the holding in Patterson, 491 U.S. at 177-\n80, and codify the holding in Runyon, 427 U.S. at 170-71.\nSee, e.g., H.R. REP. No. 102-40, 102d CONG., 1st SESS., pt.II,\nat 37 (1991) (“[Subsection (b)] overrules Patterson by adding\na new subsection to Section 1981. . . . [Subsection (c)] is\nintended to codify Runyon v. McCrary.”). To divine, from\nscattered statutes enacted years apart, that Congress has mani-\nfested an obvious intent to alter the application of § 1981 to\nexclusionary racial preferences granted on behalf of native\nHawaiians — or, indeed, that Congress has considered the\ninterrelationship of these statutes at all — grants considerably\nmore weight to congressional silence than we find appropriate\nin this context.\n\n   [10] Absent proof that Congress has validly exempted the\nSchools — or the class of native Hawaiians as a whole —\nfrom the substantive commands of § 1981, we can ascertain\nno basis for subjecting a private school’s racial preference\npremised on aboriginal blood to a wholly different standard\nthan all other racial preferences challenged under the statute.\nWe thus turn to the question of whether Congress has implic-\nitly exempted the Schools from § 1981.\n\n                               C\n\n   [11] Appellees’ argument — that a preference for native\nHawaiians should be analyzed under a relaxed level of scru-\ntiny in light of the unique trust relationship between the fed-\neral government and the native Hawaiian people — is,\nessentially, a generalized appeal to the “special relationship\ndoctrine” typically advanced to support preferences accorded\nmembers of federally recognized Indian tribes. Using this\ndoctrine, the Supreme Court has, on numerous occasions, spe-\ncifically upheld legislation granting preferential treatment to\nNative Americans. See, e.g., Mancari, 417 U.S. at 550 (col-\nlecting cases).\n\n  The seminal case recognizing the doctrine, upon which all\nsubsequent cases rely, is the Supreme Court’s 1974 decision\n\f8956             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nin Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. at 553. In Mancari, the Court\nobserved that the preference in question — a Bureau of Indian\nAffairs hiring preference for Native Americans — was “not\ndirected towards a ‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians’,” but\ninstead applied “only to members of ‘federally recognized’\ntribes.” Id. at 553 & n.24. See also id. at 554 (“The prefer-\nence, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial\ngroup, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal enti-\nties whose lives and activities are governed by the BIA in a\nunique fashion.”). In this sense, the Court determined, “the\npreference is political rather than racial in nature” and,\naccordingly, should be reviewed merely to determine whether\nit is reasonably and rationally designed to further Indian self-\ngovernment. Id. at 553 n.24 (emphasis added). Concluding\nthat it was, the Court upheld the validity of the hiring prefer-\nence against a Title VII challenge. Id. at 554 (“Here, the pref-\nerence is reasonably and directly related to a legitimate,\nnonracially based goal. This is the principal characteristic that\ngenerally is absent from proscribed forms of racial discrimi-\nnation.”). Later cases have applied Mancari’s analysis with-\nout modifying the distinction between classifications based on\npolitical affiliation and those based on race. See, e.g., Wash-\nington v. Confederated Bands & Tribes of Yakima Indian\nNation, 439 U.S. 463, 500-01 (1979) (“It is settled that the\nunique legal status of Indian tribes under federal law permits\nthe Federal Government to enact legislation singling out tribal\nIndians, legislation that might otherwise be constitutionally\noffensive.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); United States\nv. Antelope, 430 U.S. 641, 645 (1977) (“The decisions of this\nCourt leave no doubt that federal legislation with respect to\nIndian tribes, although relating to Indians as such, is not based\nupon impermissible racial classifications. Quite the contrary,\nclassifications expressly singling out Indian tribes as subjects\nof legislation are expressly provided for in the Constitution\nand supported by the ensuing history of the Federal Govern-\nment’s relations with Indians.” (footnote omitted)); Fisher v.\nDist. Court, 424 U.S. 382, 390 (1976) (per curiam) (“[W]e\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8957\nreject the argument that denying [the Indian plaintiffs] access\nto the Montana courts constitutes impermissible racial dis-\ncrimination. The exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court\ndoes not derive from the race of the plaintiff but rather from\nthe quasi-sovereign status of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe\nunder federal law.”).\n\n   [12] As it has for Native Americans, Congress has enacted\nnumerous statutes providing separate benefit programs for\nnative Hawaiians or including them in benefit programs that\nassist other native people. See, e.g., Hawaiian Homes Com-\nmission Act § 1 et seq., 42 Stat. 108 (1920) (setting aside\n200,000 acres and establishing a program of loans and long-\nterm leases for the benefit of Native Hawaiians); Department\nof Defense Appropriations Act, Pub.

No. 103-\n150, 107 Stat. 1510 (1993), the harmful consequences of\nwhich, in terms of the decimation and suffering wrought on\nthe native Hawaiian people and culture, are well documented.\nSee, e.g., Kamehameha Sch., 295 F. Supp. 2d at 1150-55. See\nalso FUCHS, HAWAII PONO: AN ETHNIC AND POLITICAL HISTORY\n(1961); R. KUYKENDALL, THE HAWAIIAN KINGDOM (1967).\nAccordingly, Congress has asserted that the United States has\n\f8960                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\na political relationship with, and a special trust obligation to,\nnative Hawaiians as the indigenous people of Hawaii. See,\ne.g., 20 U.S.C. § 7512; 42 U.S.C. § 11701.\n\n    We find it of some significance, however, that, in legislat-\ning for native Hawaiians, Congress has not consistently\ntreated them in the same manner as Native Americans.\nRather, Congress has, on occasion, opted to exclude native\nHawaiians from beneficial programs created for Native Amer-\nicans. See Kahawaiolaa v. Norton, 386 F.3d 1271, 1282 (9th\nCir. 2004) (observing that “Congress has specifically included\n. . . native Hawaiians . . . in certain privilege-granting statutes\nwhile specifically excluding [them] . . . from a number of oth-\ners”; collecting statutes). Nonetheless, Appellees appeal to\nthose statutes enacted for the benefit of native Hawaiians to\nsupport their argument that the Kamehameha Schools’ racial\npreference should be analyzed under a deferential form of\nscrutiny that recognizes Congress’s special trust relationship\nand maintains consistency among its legislative enactments.\nWe find this argument foreclosed by Appellees’ explicit con-\ncession that the preference at issue constitutes discrimination\non the basis of race.\n\n   Even assuming that Congress may validly exempt native\nHawaiians from the substantive commands of § 1981,12 a pri-\nvate school’s admissions preference cannot be exclusively\nracial, yet simultaneously subject to the special relationship\ndoctrine. The Court’s decision in Mancari, 417 U.S. at 553\nn.24, took pains to emphasize the nonracial nature of the chal-\nlenged hiring preference, expressly ruling that the precise\nclassification at issue, which was based on Indian tribal affili-\n  12\n     Cf. Rice, 528 U.S. at 518. See also Stuart Minor Benjamin, Equal Pro-\ntection and the Special Relationship: The Case of Native Hawaiians, 106\nYALE L.J. 537, 539-40 (1996) (arguing that “without a Native Hawaiian\npolitical entity that can constitute an ‘Indian Tribe[ ]’ for constitutional\npurposes, there is no ‘special relationship’ between Native Hawaiians and\nthe federal government pursuant to which programs singling out Native\nHawaiians would be subject to rational basis review”).\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       8961\nation, was not racial, but, rather, political in nature; for this\nreason, it was subject only to rational basis review.13 The\nsame principle does not apply to the classification employed\nby the Kamehameha Schools, which Appellees concede to be\nexclusively racial in nature, design and purpose. Thus,\nbecause we conclude that Appellees have waived the issue,\nwe find it unnecessary to address whether Congress has val-\nidly exempted native Hawaiians from § 1981’s substantive\nmandate.\n\n   Judge GRABER would find that the United States govern-\nment enjoys a trust relationship “that parallels (but is not iden-\ntical to) that between the federal government and Native\nAmericans.” Dissent, at 8967. Only five years ago, in the con-\ntext of a challenge brought under the Fifteenth Amendment,\nthe Supreme Court declined an invitation to hold as much,\nconcluding that to do so “would [ ] require[ ] accept[ing]\nsome beginning premises not yet established in [the Court’s]\ncase law.” Rice, 528 U.S. at 518. Importantly, the Court was\nunwilling to hold that Congress “has determined that native\nHawaiians have a status like that of Indians in organized\ntribes.” Id. We are unaware of any single case or statute that\nhas intervened to establish these “beginning premises;”\nindeed, the only statute the dissent relies on at any length —\n20 U.S.C. § 4905(a) — had been enacted and repealed long\nbefore the Court’s decision in Rice. In sum, it remains unclear\nwhether the United States government enjoys a trust relation-\nship with native Hawaiians similar to that enjoyed with orga-\nnized tribes. But under the statutes and case law as they exist\nnow, we, like the Court in Rice, find it advisable to “stay far\noff that difficult terrain.” Rice, 528 U.S. at 519.\n\n  [13] We acknowledge that the status of native Hawaiians\nand their relationship, as a class, to the federal government\n  13\n    Moreover, the Court, in Mancari, was careful to note that its decision\nwas confined to the authority of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 417 U.S. at\n554, a limitation later emphasized by the Court in Rice, 528 U.S. at 520.\n\f8962             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npresents difficult questions of serious import, complicated\nboth by history and by politics, and carrying tremendously\nfar-reaching consequences. See Rice, 528 U.S. at 501 (“The\nstatus of Hawaiian lands has presented issues of complexity\nand controversy from at least the rule of Kamehameha I to the\npresent day.”). See also Jon M. Van Dyke, The Political Sta-\ntus of the Native Hawaiian People, 17 YALE L. & POL’Y REV.\n95 (1998); Stuart Minor Benjamin, Equal Protection and the\nSpecial Relationship: The Case of Native Hawaiians, 106\nYALE L.J. 537 (1996). Nonetheless, it does not follow from\nMancari, or from any other authority of which we are aware,\nthat Congress may authorize a private school to exclusively\nrestrict admission on the basis of an express racial classifica-\ntion. Rather, the Court’s decisions in this arena have empha-\nsized the nonracial nature of classifications held to withstand\nscrutiny under modern civil rights laws. Because Appellees\ndo not argue that the classification in question should be\nviewed as anything but expressly racial, we refrain from\naddressing the matter further. See Rice, 528 U.S. at 519.\n\n                               V\n\n   [14] We emphasize that our ruling today is a narrow one.\nWe conclude only that the plaintiff-appellant has met his bur-\nden of establishing the invalidity of the racially exclusionary\naffirmative action plan in place at the Kamehameha Schools,\nas that plan currently operates as an absolute bar to admission\nfor those of the non-preferred race. Nothing in our decision,\nhowever, implicates the validity of the Pauahi Bishop Will, as\nwe do not read that document to require the use of race as an\nadmissions prerequisite. Consequently, we affirm the entry of\nsummary judgment for the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate and\nits individual trustees.\n\n  [15] For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district\ncourt granting summary judgment to the Kamehameha\nSchools is reversed. In all other respects, the judgment is\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8963\naffirmed. The case is remanded for proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\n\n\n\nGRABER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority’s conclusion that 42\nU.S.C. § 1981 bars the admissions policy of the Kamehameha\nSchools. Our only task is to discern Congress’ intent with\nrespect to the application of § 1981 to a wholly private,\nHawaiian institution that educates Native Hawaiian children\nin Hawaii. Although I have no quarrel with many of the gen-\neral principles set forth so gracefully in the majority opinion\n—and, indeed, I concur in the opinion insofar as it applies\nTitle VII principles, rather than strict scrutiny, to admissions\npreferences by a private school—I cannot agree with the opin-\nion’s narrow perspective on congressional intent.\n\n   When Congress first enacted § 1981 in 1866, the Hawaiian\nIslands were still a sovereign kingdom. But in 1991, when\nCongress revisited and reenacted § 1981 in the Civil Rights\nAct of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166, § 101, 105 Stat. 1071,\nCongress’ view of the statute’s proper scope presumptively\nwas informed by the body of law that had developed in the\ninterim. See Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32\n(1990) (“We assume that Congress is aware of existing law\nwhen it passes legislation.”); 1A Norman J. Singer, Suther-\nland Statutory Construction § 23.10, at 487 (6th ed. 2002)\n(describing the doctrine that “the legislature is presumed to\nenvision the whole body of the law when it enacts new legis-\nlation”). It is our duty to harmonize § 1981, to the extent pos-\nsible, with the statutory context in which Congress acted. See\nWatt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 267 (1981) (“We must read\n[apparently conflicting] statutes to give effect to each if we\n\f8964             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ncan do so while preserving their sense and purpose.”); Morton\nv. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 551 (1974) (“[W]hen two statutes\nare capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent\na clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to\nregard each as effective.”).\n\n   In 1988, just three years before its reenactment of § 1981,\nCongress recognized the United States government’s unique\nrelationship with Native Hawaiians, acknowledged the severe\nsocioeconomic and educational disadvantages experienced by\nNative Hawaiians, and authorized federal money for private\nentities—including the Kamehameha Schools—to provide\nloans and scholarships exclusively to Native Hawaiians. For\nexample, Congress found, in the Native Hawaiian Health Care\nAct of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-579, § 2(2) 102 Stat. 2916, that\nthe federal government’s contributions to improving the\nhealth of Native Hawaiians “are consistent with the historical\nand unique legal relationship of the United States with the\ngovernment that represented the indigenous native people of\nHawaii.”\n\n   Congress spoke particularly, and at length, to the educa-\ntional needs of Native Hawaiians in the Augustus F. Hawkins-\nRobert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School\nImprovement Amendments of 1988 (“Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments”), Pub. L. No. 100-297, tit. IV, § 4001\n(“Education for Native Hawaiians”), 102 Stat. 130:\n\n  The Congress finds and declares that —\n\n       (1) the Federal Government retains the legal\n    responsibility to enforce the administration of the\n    State of Hawaii’s public trust responsibility for the\n    betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians;\n\n       (2) in furtherance of the responsibility for the bet-\n    terment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, Con-\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                        8965\n     gress has the power to specially legislate for the\n     benefit of Native Hawaiians;\n\n       (3) the attainment of educational success is criti-\n     cal to the betterment of the conditions of Native\n     Hawaiians;\n\n       (4) it is the policy of the Federal Government to\n     encourage the maximum participation of Native\n     Hawaiians in the planning and management of\n     Native Hawaiian Education Programs;\n\n        ....\n\n       (9) special efforts in education recognizing the\n     unique cultural and historical circumstances of\n     Native Hawaiians are required.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 4901 (1991) (repealed 1994).1\n\n   Having made those findings, Congress specifically directed\nthe Secretary of Education to “make grants to the Kameha-\nmeha Schools/Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate” — that is, to the\nDefendants in this case — “for a demonstration program to\nprovide Higher Education fellowship assistance to Native\nHawaiian students.” 20 U.S.C. § 4905(a) (1991) (repealed\n1994) (emphasis added).2 The sole beneficiaries of this federal\n   1\n     Even though the quoted sections were repealed in 1994, they signal\nCongress’ sustained intent. First, the statutes were in effect in 1991 when\nCongress re-enacted § 1981. Second, Congress has continued throughout\nthe years to make similar findings about the unique educational needs of\nNative Hawaiian children and the unique relationship between the United\nStates government and the Native Hawaiian people. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512. Congress also has continued to authorize funds for educational\nprograms serving Native Hawaiian children. See, e.g., id. § 7515.\n   2\n     In 1987, a year before the enactment of the Hawkins-Stafford Amend-\nments, Congress had provided funds for a “Native Hawaiian organization”\nto “make loans to Native Hawaiian organizations and to individual Native\nHawaiians for the purpose of promoting economic development in the\nState of Hawaii.” Native American Programs Act Amendments of 1987,\nPub. L. No. 100-175, tit. V, § 506(a), 101 Stat. 926 (emphasis added).\n\f8966             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nfellowship assistance were to be “Native Hawaiian,” a term\nthat was defined in the statute—as it is in the Kamehameha\nSchools’ admission policy—to mean “a descendant of the\naboriginal people, who prior to 1778, occupied and exercised\nsovereignty in the area that now comprises the State of\nHawaii.” 20 U.S.C. § 4909(1)(C) (1991) (repealed 1994).\nCompare id. with Doe v. Kamehameha Sch./Bernice Pauahi\nBishop Estate, 295 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1156-57 (D. Haw. 2003)\n(describing the Schools’ admissions policy).\n\n   That exclusive educational preference for Native Hawai-\nians, which was motivated by the need to remedy abysmal\nsocioeconomic and educational conditions and by the United\nStates government’s unique relationship with and responsibil-\nity for Native Hawaiians, was part of the statutory context\ninto which § 1981 was reenacted. Having just adopted this\nprivate, remedial, exclusive preference for Native Hawaiians,\nCongress could not have intended for § 1981 to bar, categori-\ncally, every private program that provides an exclusive prefer-\nence to Native Hawaiians. And, for that reason, I disagree that\nthe mere fact that Kamehameha Schools grants an exclusive\npreference to Native Hawaiian applicants is dispositive of this\ncase. Indeed, the inescapable conclusion from the statutory\ncontext is that in 1991 Congress intended that a preference for\nNative Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organiza-\ntion, located on the Hawaiian monarchy’s ancestral lands, be\nupheld because it furthers the urgent need for better education\nof Native Hawaiians, which Congress had identified explicitly\nin 1988.\n\n   The majority holds that § 1981 forbids all exclusive racial\npreferences (whether remedial or not) and suggests that politi-\ncal status is the only alternative justification for the Schools’\nexclusive preference for Native Hawaiians. See maj. op. at\n8951-52. Thus, the Schools’ concession that “Native Hawai-\nian” is a racial category, for purposes of this case, dooms its\npolicy under the majority’s view. See maj. op. at 8957-60. I\ndo not perceive such a dichotomy between the racial and the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  8967\npolitical aspects of the Schools’ preference for Native Hawai-\nian applicants. That is, if “Native Hawaiian” is indeed a racial\ncategory, then Congress has shown by its actions that an\nexclusive, remedial, racial preference can be permissible, at\nleast when it is employed to remedy demonstrable and\nextreme educational and socioeconomic deficiencies that are\nfaced by a racial group that (a) is descended from people\nwhose sovereignty and culture were upended and nearly\ndestroyed, in part by the actions of the United States, and (b)\nconsequently enjoys a special trust relationship with the\nUnited States government that parallels (but is not identical\nto) that between the federal government and Native Ameri-\ncans. These factors distinguish Native Hawaiians from the\nother racial groups mentioned by the majority, see maj. op. at\n8953-54, who have received special funding. In other words,\nwe need not decide that Native Hawaiians have any particular\npolitical status in order to recognize, as Congress has, that the\nKamehameha Schools pursue unique remedial objectives and\nmay, consistent with congressional intent, employ special\nremedial tools.\n\n   The Supreme Court has not established “a rigid formula for\ntesting the validity of an affirmative action plan” applied by\na private employer, Johnson v. Transp. Agency, 770 F.2d 752,\n757 (9th Cir. 1985), nor has it spoken at all to the operation\nof § 1981 with respect to remedial preferences at a private\nschool. In the absence of more specific Supreme Court guid-\nance, we should look directly to congressional intent. Con-\ngress clearly meant to allow for the private education of\nNative Hawaiian children at the Kamehameha Schools.\nBecause the statutory context demonstrates that Congress did\nnot intend for § 1981 to bar all exclusive preferences to rem-\nedy the severe educational deficits suffered by Native Hawai-\nians, a population unique within this country, and because\nKamehameha Schools has amply demonstrated that its admis-\nsion preference is regularly reviewed and currently required\nto combat those deficits, I respectfully dissent from the major-\nity’s contrary conclusion.\n\f",

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n                           OPINION\n\nBYBEE, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Since 1887, the Kamehameha Schools have operated as the\ncharitable legacy of Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop, the last\ndirect descendant of King Kamehameha I. Private and non-\nsectarian, the Kamehameha Schools give preference to stu-\ndents who are of native Hawaiian ancestry. As a result of this\npolicy, attendance at the Kamehameha Schools is effectively\nlimited to those descended from the Hawaiian race. The issue\nconsidered here is a significant one in our statutory civil rights\nlaw: May a private, nonsectarian, commercially operated\nschool, which receives no federal funds, purposefully exclude\na student qualified for admission solely because he is not of\npure or part aboriginal blood? The parties agree that this is a\ncase of first impression in our circuit.\n\n   The plaintiff, John Doe, appeals the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants, the Kamehameha\nSchools and the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate and its individ-\nual trustees. He argues that he was denied entry to the Kame-\nhameha Schools because of his race in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981, which forbids racial discrimination in the making and\nenforcement of contracts. For the following reasons, we agree\nwith Doe and find that the Schools’ admissions policy, which\noperates in practice as an absolute bar to admission for those\nof the non-preferred race, constitutes unlawful race discrimi-\nnation in violation of § 1981. Accordingly, we reverse the dis-\ntrict court’s decision granting summary judgment to the\nKamehameha Schools.\n\n                                I\n\n   The facts are not in dispute. The Kamehameha Schools\ncomprises a system of private, nonsectarian schools which are\ndispersed among the Hawaiian Islands. See EEOC v.

She further instructs that a portion of the trust’s annual\nincome should be devoted “to the support and education of\norphans, and others in indigent circumstances, giving the pref-\nerence to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood.” Pauahi\nBishop Will at 18. While this racial preference is expressly\nlisted as a criterion for the administration of estate resources\ncharitably directed to orphans and indigents, the Will is nota-\nbly devoid of any mention of race as a criterion for admission\ninto the Kamehameha Schools. As the Schools’ 1885 Pro-\nspectus observed: “The noble minded Hawaiian chiefess who\nendowed the Kamehameha Schools, put no limitations of race\nor condition on her general bequest. Instruction will be given\nonly in English language, but The Schools will be opened to\nall nationalities.”2\n\n  Rather than institute race as an admissions prerequisite,\nPauahi left to her Trustees the discretion “to regulate the\nadmission of pupils” and “to make all such rules and regula-\n  2\n    Similarly, in a February 11, 1897 letter, Charles Bishop noted: “There\nis nothing in the will of Mrs. Bishop excluding white boys or girls from\nthe Schools . . . .” In a February 20, 1901 letter he further stated: “Accord-\ning to the reading of Clause 13 on Page 8 of the Will as published, the\npreference to Hawaiians of pure or part aboriginal blood, applies only to\neducation of orphans and others in indigent circumstances.”\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  8929\ntions as they may deem necessary for the government” of the\nKamehameha Schools. Pauahi Bishop Will at 18. The original\ntrustees determined, however, that it was Pauahi’s intent to\nprefer students of native Hawaiian ancestry. Specifically, the\npolicy articulated by Charles Bishop was that “boys and girls\nof pure or part aboriginal blood . . . should have preference;\nthat is[,] they should have the first right.” Accordingly, the\nadmissions process at Kamehameha currently proceeds in two\nphases: first, the applicant must demonstrate that he possesses\nthe minimum qualifications necessary to meet the Schools’\nrigorous academic standards and, second, he must complete\nan “Ethnic Ancestry Survey” designed to verify his aboriginal\nblood. The Schools forthrightly admit that as long as there are\nqualified students who possess at least some native Hawaiian\nancestry, they will be admitted before even the most qualified\nof those who lack aboriginal blood. It is this “Hawaiians first”\nadmissions policy that motivates the instant controversy.\n\n   The plaintiff-appellant, John Doe, twice sought admission\nto the Kamehameha Schools and, having met the academic\nrequirements for admission, was twice determined to be a\n“competitive applicant.” After completing the Ethnic Ances-\ntry Survey, in which he acknowledged that he possessed no\naboriginal blood, his application was each time, as expected,\ndenied. Still desiring to attend the Kamehameha Schools, Doe\nfiled suit alleging that the Schools’ admissions policy violates\n42 U.S.C. § 1981, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of\n1991, Pub. L.

Second, § 16 of the 1870 Act\nomitted language contained in the 1866 Act guaranteeing\nproperty rights equivalent to those enjoyed by white citizens;\nthis language was reenacted separately in what is now 42\nU.S.C. § 1982. In 1874 federal statutory law was codified.\nSection 1977 of the Revised Code of 1874 is identical with\nthe present § 1981(a), which is prefaced by the caption “Equal\nrights under the law,” and provides the following:\n\n    All persons within the jurisdiction of the United\n    States shall have the same right in every State and\n    Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be\n    parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal ben-\n    efit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\n    persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens,\n    and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penal-\n    ties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and\n    to no other.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1981(a).\n\n   Immediately following its passage, what is now § 1981\nunderwent nearly a century of desuetude during which debate\nregarding its scope and meaning was generally subsumed by\nthe controversy surrounding the newly ratified Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause. Partially owing to lin-\ngering uncertainty regarding the scope of the statute and the\nextent of Congress’s authority to prohibit discrimination\ndivorced from state action, § 1981 would not gain indepen-\ndent significance until the late 1960s. See, e.g., Hurd, 334\nU.S. at 31 (declaring that “governmental action” was required\nin a suit based on the Civil Rights Act of 1866); The Civil\n\f                  DOE v.

See Runyon, 427 U.S. at 170;\nJones, 392 U.S. at 423.\n\n   In Jones, the Court interpreted a companion statute, 42\nU.S.C. § 1982, to encompass and prohibit racial discrimina-\ntion in purely private transactions. 392 U.S. at 423-24. The\nCourt held that the right conferred by § 1982 — the same\nright to “inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real\nand personal property” as is enjoyed by white citizens — is\nsecured against interference from both governmental and pri-\nvate actions. Id. (“[W]hen Congress provided in § 1 of the\nCivil Rights Act that the right to purchase and lease property\nwas to be enjoyed equally throughout the United States by\nNegro and white citizens alike, it plainly meant to secure that\nright against interference from any source whatever, whether\ngovernmental or private.”). Thus, relying on the legislative\nhistory of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Court con-\ncluded that Congress intended to prohibit “all racial discrimi-\nnation, private and public, in the sale . . . of property,” id. at\n437, and, further, that this prohibition was within Congress’s\npower under section two of the Thirteenth Amendment “ratio-\nnally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of\nslavery, and . . . to translate that determination into effective\nlegislation.” Id. at 440. Eight years later, in Runyon, the Court\nexplicitly found the same result dictated under § 1981.\n\n   Runyon involved a challenge to two private schools’ admis-\nsions programs which categorically excluded African-\nAmerican students. 427 U.S. at 170. Although the schools\n\f8936             DOE v.

Runyon, 427 U.S. at 170-71.\nAccording to the Court, the schools’ racially exclusive admis-\nsions policies constituted “a classic violation of § 1981.” Id.\nat 172. The Court found that since it is derived from both the\nActs of 1866 and 1870, § 1981 validly reaches private, as well\nas public, racial discrimination based upon Congress’s Thir-\nteenth Amendment powers. Id. at 168 n.8, 179 (“Section\n1981, as applied to the conduct at issue here, constitutes a[ ]\n[valid] exercise of federal legislative power under § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment . . . .”).\n\n   Thus, together, and more than one hundred years after\n§ 1981’s passage, Jones and Runyon finally dispensed with\nthe state action requirement and held that the Civil Rights Act\nof 1866 reached purely private acts of discrimination by vir-\ntue of Congress’s power under section two of the Thirteenth\nAmendment. How far the Thirteenth Amendment enforce-\nment power and the doctrine of Runyon extended, however,\nremained open.\n\n   In the same term that it decided Runyon, the Court held that\n§ 1981 prohibits racial discrimination in private employment\nagainst white persons as well as nonwhite persons.

McDon-\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                    8937\nald involved a claim by two white employees of the Santa Fe\nTrail Transportation Company who were accused of misap-\npropriating company property; the company had also accused\nan African-American employee of the same offense. Shortly\nthereafter, the two white employees were fired, but the\nAfrican-American employee was not. Believing their termina-\ntion to be racially-based, the two white employees filed suit\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and § 1981\nalleging unlawful employment discrimination. To resolve the\ndispute, the Court had to address whether § 1981 encom-\npassed discrimination against white persons. Reasoning that\nCongress’s broad language evinced an intent “to proscribe\ndiscrimination in the making or enforcement of contracts\nagainst, or in favor of, any race,” the Court observed:\n\n    Unlikely as it might have appeared in 1866 that\n    white citizens would encounter substantial racial dis-\n    crimination of the sort proscribed under the Act, the\n    statutory structure and legislative history persuade us\n    that the 39th Congress was intent upon establishing\n    in the federal law a broader principle than would\n    have been necessary simply to meet the particular\n    and immediate plight of the newly freed Negro\n    slaves.\n\nId. at 295-96.\n\n   Without clarifying the source of Congress’s power to enact\na law that prohibited private race discrimination against\nwhites, the Court in McDonald declined to restrict § 1981 to\nclaims only by African-Americans. By avoiding the constitu-\ntional questions implicated by its broad reading of the statute,\nthe Court left unresolved whether Congress’s power to pro-\nhibit discrimination against white persons in private employ-\nment also emanated from § 1981’s Thirteenth Amendment\norigins or whether it might be based on some other source;\nparticularly, Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause.\nBecause the Santa Fe Trail Transportation Company was also\n\f8938                DOE v.

Having imported Title VII’s McDonnell Douglas\norder of proof, the Court elaborated to explain, in detailed\nfashion, the specific evidentiary showings required:\n\n    Under our well-established framework, the plaintiff\n    has the initial burden of proving, by a preponderance\n    of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination.\n    . . .

While the Court could have suggested that a § 1981\ndefendant must demonstrate that race-based action is nar-\nrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest,\nsee, e.g., Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, it stated instead that the\nemployer must show merely “that the plaintiff was rejected,\nor the other applicant was chosen, for a legitimate nondis-\n\f8942             DOE v.

We find the Court’s\ncomplete description of the burden — setting forth both the\norder of proof and the nature of the proof required — to be\nthe best indication from the Supreme Court as to how lower\ncourts should shape the contours of a § 1981 challenge to a\nprivate entity’s racially discriminatory practice.\n\n   In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress amended the stat-\nute specifically to overrule Patterson’s holding that § 1981\n\f                     DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                          8943\ndoes not extend to postformation conduct. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(b) (defining the phrase “make and enforce contracts”\nto include “the making, performance, modification, and termi-\nnation of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privi-\nleges, terms and conditions of the contractual relationship”).\nThe amended statute also clarified any residual doubt as to\nCongress’s intention that § 1981 apply to private discrimina-\ntion: “[t]he rights protected by this section are protected\nagainst impairment by nongovernmental discrimination.” 42\nU.S.C. § 1981(c). Importantly, nothing in the amended statute\ncalls into question Patterson’s discussion of the McDonnell\nDouglas proof structure or the nature of proof required in a\n§ 1981 suit against a private entity.\n\n   [3] Although the question has never been squarely presented,5\nwe read the Court’s decisions both in Patterson and in Gen-\neral Building Contractors to indicate a willingness to look to\nthe Fourteenth Amendment as a means for restricting liability\nto the types of racially motivated practices that led Congress\nto enact § 1981 — namely, intentional discrimination on the\nbasis of race — but to look to Title VII jurisprudence to clar-\nify the order and nature of the proof.

We have never explic-\nitly considered whether Title VII’s requirement that the defendant come\nforward with a “legitimate nondiscriminatory reason” also applies in the\n§ 1981 context.\n\f8944                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nMemphis, 451 U.S. at 126 (finding § 1982 inapplicable where\n“the record discloses no racially discriminatory motive” but\ninstead “demonstrates that the interests that did motivate the\n[defendant] are legitimate”).\n\n   Contrary to the appellant’s argument, we do not find the\nCourt’s recent decisions in the “Michigan Affirmative Action\nCases” relevant to our analysis. See Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343\n(concluding that the University of Michigan Law School’s\nadmissions program satisfied strict scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause and, therefore, that it also satisfied Title VI\nand § 1981); Gratz, 539 U.S. at 275-76 n.23 (concluding that\nthe University of Michigan’s undergraduate admissions pro-\ngram failed strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause\nand, therefore, that it also violated Title VI and § 1981). Aside\nfrom the fact that both cases involved a challenge to a public\nuniversity’s use of racial preferences in admissions, neither\ncase presented the Court with an occasion to address, at any\nlength, the appropriate standard of scrutiny for a § 1981 chal-\nlenge. Because the preference in Grutter satisfied strict scru-\ntiny, it necessarily would satisfy a lower standard; as the\npreference in Gratz failed strict scrutiny, the invalidity of the\nuniversity’s admissions program rendered it unnecessary for\nthe Court to consider whether it could satisfy a lower standard.6\nThe appellant relies, however, on the Court’s citation, in\nGrutter, to General Building Contractors, which is followed\nby the parenthetical note, “the prohibition against discrimina-\ntion in § 1981 is co-extensive with the Equal Protection\nClause.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 343 (citing Gen. Bldg. Contrac-\ntors, 458 U.S. at 389-91). The Court in Gratz similarly\ndropped a footnote citing General Building Contractors for\nthe proposition that “purposeful discrimination that violates\n  6\n    We find our recent decision in Sagana inapplicable for the same reason\nthat we find the Supreme Court’s decision in Grutter irrelevant to the facts\nof this appeal. See Sagana, 384 F.3d at 743 (concluding that a challenged\ngovernmental employment policy that satisfied Fourteenth Amendment\nscrutiny necessarily also satisfied scrutiny under § 1981).\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8945\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nwill also violate § 1981.” Gratz, 539 U.S. at 276 n.23 (citing\nGen. Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 389-90). See also\nSagana, 384 F.3d at 743.\n\n   Mindful of the inherent dangers of according undue weight\nto isolated statements from decisions not directly on point, we\nread these parenthetical notes simply as recognizing that both\nthe Equal Protection Clause and § 1981 require a showing of\nintentional discrimination; they are co-extensive on this point.\nThe Court’s decision in Patterson incorporated this holding,\nseven years after General Building Contractors, when it\ninstructed lower courts to apply the McDonnell Douglas\nframework to claims of racial discrimination in employment\nbrought under § 1981, while noting that the “petitioner retains\nthe final burden of persuading the jury of intentional discrimi-\nnation.” Patterson, 491 U.S. at 187 (emphasis added). Simply\nput, the Supreme Court’s parenthetical notations in Grutter\nand Gratz should be read in light of the specific import of the\ncited case, and General Building Contractors does nothing\nmore than specify that intentional discrimination must be\nestablished in order to sustain both an equal protection and a\n§ 1981 challenge. Although, like the Fourteenth Amendment,\n§ 1981 reaches only intentional discrimination, § 1981 is not\notherwise co-extensive with the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n   From the historical context in which it was passed as well\nas the cases interpreting its command, we are persuaded that\n§ 1981, like Title VII, “was not intended to incorporate and\nparticularize the commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments,” Weber, 443 U.S. at 206 n.6, nor was it\nintended to apply those commands to private sector discrimi-\nnation. For this reason, we conclude that § 1981 should not be\nread in pari materia with the Fourteenth Amendment to\nrequire the application of strict scrutiny to all private race-\nbased preferences. See id. (declining to read Title VII and\nTitle VI in pari materia); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630 n.8 (not-\ning Congress’s “desire to preserve a relatively large domain\n\f8946               DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nfor voluntary employer action”). In sum, having generally\nabandoned, after Runyon and Jones, the Fourteenth Amend-\nment as the model for interpreting, and limiting the reach of,\n§§ 1981 and 1982, we conclude that the substantive standards\nembodied in modern civil rights laws better capture the juris-\nprudence of § 1981.\n\n   [4] Although the instant case involves a § 1981 claim\nagainst a private school, we find no reason to depart from the\nstandards outlined in Patterson and well-established in the\ncases interpreting Title VII. While the analysis necessarily\nmust be modified in order to account for differences of con-\ntext, the substantive guarantee should remain the same: the\nright to make and enforce contracts free from illegitimate and\nunlawful discrimination on the basis of race. Accordingly, we\nhold that a § 1981 suit against a purely private school is gov-\nerned by the substantive standards applicable to race-based\nchallenges brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964. This means that once the § 1981 plaintiff estab-\nlishes a prima facie case of intentional race discrimination, the\ndefendant must come forward with a legitimate nondiscrimi-\nnatory reason justifying the challenged practice; if such a rea-\nson is offered the plaintiff may still attempt to show that the\nreason is a pretext for unlawful race discrimination.\n\n   It remains to clarify how these standards should operate in\nthe context of private education.\n\n                                  B\n\n   Under the proof structure and accompanying substantive\nstandards that we now import, the complainant in a § 1981\nsuit against a purely private school must carry the initial bur-\nden of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination.\nSee McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802.7 Where an explicit\n  7\n   As is true with respect to the application of the McDonnell Douglas\nproof structure in the context of Title VII employment discrimination\n\f                     DOE v.

Toward this end,\nthe Schools urge that its policy constitutes a valid affirmative\naction plan rationally related to redressing present imbalances\nin the socioeconomic and educational achievement of native\nHawaiians, producing native Hawaiian leadership for commu-\nnity involvement, and revitalizing native Hawaiian culture.\n\n   [5] The Supreme Court has held that Title VII’s prohibition\nagainst racial discrimination “does not condemn all private,\nvoluntary, race-conscious affirmative action plans.” Weber,\n443 U.S. at 208. Consequently, in the Title VII context, if the\nchallenged employment decision was made pursuant to such\na plan, the existence of an affirmative action plan itself can\nform the basis of a legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale.

At issue in Weber was an affirmative action\nplan collectively bargained by a union and an employer that\nreserved for African-American employees fifty percent of the\nopenings in an in-plant craft training program. In ruling that\nthe challenged plan fell on the permissible side of the line\ndemarcating valid affirmative action plans from those which\nviolate the commands of Title VII, the Court observed that the\npurpose of the plan mirrored that of Title VII: to “break down\nold patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy” and to\n“ ‘open employment opportunities for [minorities] in occupa-\ntions which have been traditionally closed to them.’ ” Id. at\n208 (citing and quoting 110 CONG. REC. 6548 (1964) (remarks\nof Sen. Humphrey)). It emphasized that the plan did so with-\nout “unnecessarily trammel[ing] the interests of the white\nemployees”; specifically, the plan did not “require the dis-\ncharge of white workers and their replacement with new black\nhirees,” and did not “create an absolute bar to the advance-\nment of white employees.” Id. Finally, the Court noted that\n“the plan is a temporary measure; it is not intended to main-\n\f8950                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\ntain racial balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest racial\nimbalance.” Id.9\n\n   While “[t]he Weber Court did not establish a rigid formula\nfor testing the validity of an affirmative action plan,” Johnson\nv.

See, e.g., Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 627 (“The assessment of the legality of the [affirma-\ntive action plan in question] must be guided by our decision\nin Weber.”); Local 28 of Sheet Metal Workers Int’l Ass’n v.\nEEOC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111747\"><a href=\"/opinion/111747/sheet-metal-workers-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 479 (1986) (applying Weber and find-\ning that a court-imposed union membership goal and fund\nestablished to increase minority enrollment, which did not\n“require any member of the union to be laid off,” “discrimi-\nnate against existing union members,” nor bar admission of\nwhite applicants to the union, did not “unnecessarily tram-\nmel[ ] the interests of white employees”). We are persuaded\nthat these general principles may be rationally applied in the\ncontext of private education, with certain modifications to\naccount for the differences of context.\n\n   [7] We recently distilled the Court’s analysis in Weber into\nthree distinct requirements: affirmative action plans must (1)\nrespond to a manifest imbalance in its work force; (2) not\n“ ‘create[ ] an absolute bar to the[ ] advancement’ ” of the\nnon-preferred race or “ ‘unnecessarily trammel[ ]’ ” their\nrights; and (3) do no more than is necessary to achieve a bal-\nance.

The appellant\nclaims that the Schools’ program fails under the first of these\ncriteria: rather than addressing a manifest internal imbalance,\n  9\n   Under the plan, the preference was slated to end as soon as the percent-\nage of minority skilled craftworkers approximated the percentage of\nminorities in the local labor force. Weber, 443 U.S. at 208-09.\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8951\nit seeks to address an imbalance external to its student popula-\ntion.\n\n   [8] We do not address the appellant’s claims because we\nfind the second of Weber’s guiding principles fatal to the pro-\ngram in place at the Kamehameha Schools. The school’s\nadmission policy operates as an absolute bar to admission for\nnon-Hawaiians. Kamehameha’s unconditional refusal to\nadmit non-Hawaiians so long as there are native Hawaiian\napplicants categorically “trammels” the rights of non-\nHawaiians. The Court in Runyon made clear that an admis-\nsions policy that consciously and conspicuously denies admis-\nsion to all members of the non-preferred race on account of\ntheir race is “a classic violation of § 1981.” 427 U.S. at 172.\n\n   Appellees argue, nonetheless, that the need is so great that\nthe Schools should be permitted to admit only native Hawai-\nians until the educational deficits affecting that community\ndisappear. They present abundant evidence demonstrating that\nnative Hawaiians are over-represented in negative socioeco-\nnomic statistics such as poverty, homelessness, child abuse\nand neglect, and criminal activity; they are more likely to live\nin economically disadvantaged neighborhoods and attend\nlow-quality schools; and, because of low levels of educational\nattainment, they are severely under-represented in profes-\nsional and managerial positions, and over-represented in low-\npaying service and labor occupations. In sum, they urge, even\nthough the admissions policy creates an “absolute bar,” it is\nnecessary for the Schools to “trammel” the interests of non-\naboriginal applicants in order to reach its goal.\n\n   [9] To accept this argument, however, is to completely\nabolish what we perceive to be an important limitation\nembodied in Weber’s second principle: fairness to applicants\nof the non-preferred race. Even if we assumed that some, lim-\nited racial preferences might be appropriate in order for the\nSchools to advance its mission, an absolute bar on the basis\nof race alone exceeds any reasonable application of Weber,\n\f8952             DOE v.

We cannot agree with the district court’s con-\nclusion that the challenged program constitutes a valid affir-\nmative action plan supplying a legitimate nondiscriminatory\nreason for the Schools’ racially exclusionary admissions pol-\nicy.

They argue that because Congress has given native\nHawaiians in general, and the Kamehameha Schools in partic-\nular, preferences in the context of education, see 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7901 et seq.; 20 U.S.C. § 7511 et seq., our analysis must\nharmonize these enactments by according the Schools greater\ndeference under § 1981. Appellees argue that it is inconceiv-\nable that the same Congress that enacted preferences for\nnative Hawaiians would think that the Schools preferences\nviolate § 1981; additionally, they argue that we can give\n§ 1981 this more generous reading because § 1981 was\namended in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.\n\f                    DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                         8953\n   We have located no authority for the proposition that con-\ngressional intent, as manifested by scattered statutes adopted\nspecially for the benefit of native Hawaiians, is sufficient to\nmodify the standards embodied in a statute of general applica-\nbility. We cannot imagine the task of trying to harmonize all\nof the various acts of Congress — a prodigious output that is\never expanding and contracting — with statutes of general\napplicability such as § 1981.10 Congress is quite capable of\ncreating exceptions for such laws, and we would intrude on\nits ability or willingness to do so if we scoured the U.S. Code\nfor hints of contrary intent. For reasons both of separation of\npowers and our own sanity, we will not undertake such a task.\nRather, our role, in the context of § 1981, “is limited to inter-\npreting what Congress may do and has done.” Patterson, 491\nU.S. at 188.\n\n   Judge GRABER, in dissent, urges us to consider 20 U.S.C.\n§ 4905(a) (1991) (repealed 1994) as evidence of Congress’s\nintent to abrogate the otherwise plain language of § 1981 as\nit applies to the Kamehameha Schools’ racially exclusionary\nadmissions policy. We are told that because the now repealed\n§ 4905(a) authorized grants to the Kamehameha Schools to\ndevelop a demonstration program to support native Hawaiians\nwho choose to attend college, it follows as an “inescapable\nconclusion” that Congress intends the Schools to refuse to\nadmit, into its K-12 program, anyone without aboriginal\nblood. Dissent, at 8966. Even assuming, arguendo, the prem-\nise that § 1981 may affect parties differently when Congress\nso directs, we cannot agree that a statute adopted in 1988 and\nrepealed in 1994 created a native Hawaiian carve-out for\n§ 1981.11\n  10\n     This is particularly true when we deal with a statute of such venerable\nprovenance as § 1981, one that long pre-dates Congress’s more recent\nnative Hawaiian preferences.\n  11\n     Reading § 4905(a) to authorize exclusive racial preferences for native\nHawaiians in education may raise constitutional problems in light of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Rice. See Rice, 528 U.S. at 518 (declining to\n\f8954                DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\n   Over the years, Congress has directed research, support and\nassistance at numerous minority groups, as well as the cate-\ngory of “minorities” in general. See, e.g., Minority Access to\nResearch Careers Program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 241, 285k, 288,\n288a (1988); Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship Program,\nPub.L. 99-498, Title IX, § 901(a), Oct. 17, 1986, 100 Stat.\n1550 (repealed Pub.L. 105-244, Title VII, § 702, Oct. 7, 1998,\n112 Stat. 1803); Excellence in Mathematics, Science and\nEngineering Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-589, 104 Stat. 2881\n(1990); African-American History Landmark Theme Study,\nPub.L. 102-98, Aug. 17, 1991, 105 Stat. 485 (1991). But it\nwould be overreaching to interpret these statutes as blanket\napproval for private race discrimination that is otherwise vio-\nlative of § 1981. So far as we are aware, Congress has never\neven considered the racial bar to admission in place at the\nKamehameha Schools, and we cannot infer implicit approval\nfrom a statute that merely authorized financial support for\ncollege-bound native Hawaiians. Thus, while we agree with\nthe dissent that we should read statutes capable of co-\nexistence “to give effect to each,” we find no conflict between\n§ 4905(a), which authorizes federal financial assistance to\npromote native Hawaiian higher education, and § 1981, which\nforbids a private institution from erecting an absolute bar to\nadmission or advancement solely on the basis of race.

If Congress’s classifications\nbased on native Hawaiian status are, indeed, of a racial nature, they may\nfall subject to strict scrutiny under the equal protection component of the\nFifth Amendment. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227 (“[A]ll racial classifica-\ntions, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor,\nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.”).\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8955\nmore than overrule the holding in Patterson, 491 U.S. at 177-\n80, and codify the holding in Runyon, 427 U.S. at 170-71.\nSee, e.g., H.R. REP. No. 102-40, 102d CONG., 1st SESS., pt.II,\nat 37 (1991) (“[Subsection (b)] overrules Patterson by adding\na new subsection to Section 1981. . . . [Subsection (c)] is\nintended to codify Runyon v. McCrary.”). To divine, from\nscattered statutes enacted years apart, that Congress has mani-\nfested an obvious intent to alter the application of § 1981 to\nexclusionary racial preferences granted on behalf of native\nHawaiians — or, indeed, that Congress has considered the\ninterrelationship of these statutes at all — grants considerably\nmore weight to congressional silence than we find appropriate\nin this context.\n\n   [10] Absent proof that Congress has validly exempted the\nSchools — or the class of native Hawaiians as a whole —\nfrom the substantive commands of § 1981, we can ascertain\nno basis for subjecting a private school’s racial preference\npremised on aboriginal blood to a wholly different standard\nthan all other racial preferences challenged under the statute.\nWe thus turn to the question of whether Congress has implic-\nitly exempted the Schools from § 1981.\n\n                               C\n\n   [11] Appellees’ argument — that a preference for native\nHawaiians should be analyzed under a relaxed level of scru-\ntiny in light of the unique trust relationship between the fed-\neral government and the native Hawaiian people — is,\nessentially, a generalized appeal to the “special relationship\ndoctrine” typically advanced to support preferences accorded\nmembers of federally recognized Indian tribes. Using this\ndoctrine, the Supreme Court has, on numerous occasions, spe-\ncifically upheld legislation granting preferential treatment to\nNative Americans. See, e.g., Mancari, 417 U.S. at 550 (col-\nlecting cases).\n\n  The seminal case recognizing the doctrine, upon which all\nsubsequent cases rely, is the Supreme Court’s 1974 decision\n\f8956             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\nin Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. at 553. In Mancari, the Court\nobserved that the preference in question — a Bureau of Indian\nAffairs hiring preference for Native Americans — was “not\ndirected towards a ‘racial’ group consisting of ‘Indians’,” but\ninstead applied “only to members of ‘federally recognized’\ntribes.” Id. at 553 & n.24. See also id. at 554 (“The prefer-\nence, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial\ngroup, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal enti-\nties whose lives and activities are governed by the BIA in a\nunique fashion.”). In this sense, the Court determined, “the\npreference is political rather than racial in nature” and,\naccordingly, should be reviewed merely to determine whether\nit is reasonably and rationally designed to further Indian self-\ngovernment. Id. at 553 n.24 (emphasis added). Concluding\nthat it was, the Court upheld the validity of the hiring prefer-\nence against a Title VII challenge. Id. at 554 (“Here, the pref-\nerence is reasonably and directly related to a legitimate,\nnonracially based goal. This is the principal characteristic that\ngenerally is absent from proscribed forms of racial discrimi-\nnation.”). Later cases have applied Mancari’s analysis with-\nout modifying the distinction between classifications based on\npolitical affiliation and those based on race. See, e.g., Wash-\nington v.

Insofar as\nthese statutes have articulated a constitutional basis, they have\nusually asserted that the programs are enacted pursuant to a\nspecial relationship between the federal government and\nnative Hawaiians akin to that with Native Americans. See,\ne.g., 20 U.S.C. § 7512(13) (containing findings); 42 U.S.C.\n§ 11701(17) (same); 20 U.S.C. § 4901 (1991) (repealed 1994)\n(same).\n\n   In addition, Congress has expressly, and repeatedly, deter-\nmined that the United States wrongfully participated in the\ndemise of the Hawaiian Monarchy, see, e.g., Native Hawaiian\nEducation Act, 20 U.S.C. § 7512 (findings); Native Hawaiian\nHealth Care Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C. § 11701 (findings);\nApology Resolution, S.

Supp. 2d at 1150-55. See\nalso FUCHS, HAWAII PONO: AN ETHNIC AND POLITICAL HISTORY\n(1961); R. KUYKENDALL, THE HAWAIIAN KINGDOM (1967).\nAccordingly, Congress has asserted that the United States has\n\f8960                DOE v.

See,\ne.g., 20 U.S.C. § 7512; 42 U.S.C. § 11701.\n\n    We find it of some significance, however, that, in legislat-\ning for native Hawaiians, Congress has not consistently\ntreated them in the same manner as Native Americans.\nRather, Congress has, on occasion, opted to exclude native\nHawaiians from beneficial programs created for Native Amer-\nicans.

Nonetheless, Appellees appeal to\nthose statutes enacted for the benefit of native Hawaiians to\nsupport their argument that the Kamehameha Schools’ racial\npreference should be analyzed under a deferential form of\nscrutiny that recognizes Congress’s special trust relationship\nand maintains consistency among its legislative enactments.\nWe find this argument foreclosed by Appellees’ explicit con-\ncession that the preference at issue constitutes discrimination\non the basis of race.\n\n   Even assuming that Congress may validly exempt native\nHawaiians from the substantive commands of § 1981,12 a pri-\nvate school’s admissions preference cannot be exclusively\nracial, yet simultaneously subject to the special relationship\ndoctrine.

KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                       8961\nation, was not racial, but, rather, political in nature; for this\nreason, it was subject only to rational basis review.13 The\nsame principle does not apply to the classification employed\nby the Kamehameha Schools, which Appellees concede to be\nexclusively racial in nature, design and purpose. Thus,\nbecause we conclude that Appellees have waived the issue,\nwe find it unnecessary to address whether Congress has val-\nidly exempted native Hawaiians from § 1981’s substantive\nmandate.\n\n   Judge GRABER would find that the United States govern-\nment enjoys a trust relationship “that parallels (but is not iden-\ntical to) that between the federal government and Native\nAmericans.” Dissent, at 8967. Only five years ago, in the con-\ntext of a challenge brought under the Fifteenth Amendment,\nthe Supreme Court declined an invitation to hold as much,\nconcluding that to do so “would [ ] require[ ] accept[ing]\nsome beginning premises not yet established in [the Court’s]\ncase law.” Rice, 528 U.S. at 518. Importantly, the Court was\nunwilling to hold that Congress “has determined that native\nHawaiians have a status like that of Indians in organized\ntribes.” Id. We are unaware of any single case or statute that\nhas intervened to establish these “beginning premises;”\nindeed, the only statute the dissent relies on at any length —\n20 U.S.C. § 4905(a) — had been enacted and repealed long\nbefore the Court’s decision in Rice. In sum, it remains unclear\nwhether the United States government enjoys a trust relation-\nship with native Hawaiians similar to that enjoyed with orga-\nnized tribes. But under the statutes and case law as they exist\nnow, we, like the Court in Rice, find it advisable to “stay far\noff that difficult terrain.” Rice, 528 U.S. at 519.\n\n  [13] We acknowledge that the status of native Hawaiians\nand their relationship, as a class, to the federal government\n  13\n    Moreover, the Court, in Mancari, was careful to note that its decision\nwas confined to the authority of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, 417 U.S. at\n554, a limitation later emphasized by the Court in Rice, 528 U.S. at 520.\n\f8962             DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS\npresents difficult questions of serious import, complicated\nboth by history and by politics, and carrying tremendously\nfar-reaching consequences. See Rice, 528 U.S. at 501 (“The\nstatus of Hawaiian lands has presented issues of complexity\nand controversy from at least the rule of Kamehameha I to the\npresent day.”). See also Jon M. Van Dyke, The Political Sta-\ntus of the Native Hawaiian People, 17 YALE L. & POL’Y REV.\n95 (1998); Stuart Minor Benjamin, Equal Protection and the\nSpecial Relationship: The Case of Native Hawaiians, 106\nYALE L.J. 537 (1996). Nonetheless, it does not follow from\nMancari, or from any other authority of which we are aware,\nthat Congress may authorize a private school to exclusively\nrestrict admission on the basis of an express racial classifica-\ntion. Rather, the Court’s decisions in this arena have empha-\nsized the nonracial nature of classifications held to withstand\nscrutiny under modern civil rights laws. Because Appellees\ndo not argue that the classification in question should be\nviewed as anything but expressly racial, we refrain from\naddressing the matter further. See Rice, 528 U.S. at 519.\n\n                               V\n\n   [14] We emphasize that our ruling today is a narrow one.\nWe conclude only that the plaintiff-appellant has met his bur-\nden of establishing the invalidity of the racially exclusionary\naffirmative action plan in place at the Kamehameha Schools,\nas that plan currently operates as an absolute bar to admission\nfor those of the non-preferred race. Nothing in our decision,\nhowever, implicates the validity of the Pauahi Bishop Will, as\nwe do not read that document to require the use of race as an\nadmissions prerequisite. Consequently, we affirm the entry of\nsummary judgment for the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate and\nits individual trustees.\n\n  [15] For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district\ncourt granting summary judgment to the Kamehameha\nSchools is reversed. In all other respects, the judgment is\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                 8963\naffirmed. The case is remanded for proceedings consistent\nwith this opinion.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\n\n\n\nGRABER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart:\n\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority’s conclusion that 42\nU.S.C. § 1981 bars the admissions policy of the Kamehameha\nSchools. Our only task is to discern Congress’ intent with\nrespect to the application of § 1981 to a wholly private,\nHawaiian institution that educates Native Hawaiian children\nin Hawaii. Although I have no quarrel with many of the gen-\neral principles set forth so gracefully in the majority opinion\n—and, indeed, I concur in the opinion insofar as it applies\nTitle VII principles, rather than strict scrutiny, to admissions\npreferences by a private school—I cannot agree with the opin-\nion’s narrow perspective on congressional intent.\n\n   When Congress first enacted § 1981 in 1866, the Hawaiian\nIslands were still a sovereign kingdom.

For\nexample, Congress found, in the Native Hawaiian Health Care\nAct of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-579, § 2(2) 102 Stat. 2916, that\nthe federal government’s contributions to improving the\nhealth of Native Hawaiians “are consistent with the historical\nand unique legal relationship of the United States with the\ngovernment that represented the indigenous native people of\nHawaii.”\n\n   Congress spoke particularly, and at length, to the educa-\ntional needs of Native Hawaiians in the Augustus F. Hawkins-\nRobert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School\nImprovement Amendments of 1988 (“Hawkins-Stafford\nAmendments”), Pub. L. No. 100-297, tit.

First, the statutes were in effect in 1991 when\nCongress re-enacted § 1981. Second, Congress has continued throughout\nthe years to make similar findings about the unique educational needs of\nNative Hawaiian children and the unique relationship between the United\nStates government and the Native Hawaiian people. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C.\n§ 7512. Congress also has continued to authorize funds for educational\nprograms serving Native Hawaiian children. See, e.g., id. § 7515.\n   2\n     In 1987, a year before the enactment of the Hawkins-Stafford Amend-\nments, Congress had provided funds for a “Native Hawaiian organization”\nto “make loans to Native Hawaiian organizations and to individual Native\nHawaiians for the purpose of promoting economic development in the\nState of Hawaii.” Native American Programs Act Amendments of 1987,\nPub.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1156-57 (D. Haw. 2003)\n(describing the Schools’ admissions policy).\n\n   That exclusive educational preference for Native Hawai-\nians, which was motivated by the need to remedy abysmal\nsocioeconomic and educational conditions and by the United\nStates government’s unique relationship with and responsibil-\nity for Native Hawaiians, was part of the statutory context\ninto which § 1981 was reenacted. Having just adopted this\nprivate, remedial, exclusive preference for Native Hawaiians,\nCongress could not have intended for § 1981 to bar, categori-\ncally, every private program that provides an exclusive prefer-\nence to Native Hawaiians. And, for that reason, I disagree that\nthe mere fact that Kamehameha Schools grants an exclusive\npreference to Native Hawaiian applicants is dispositive of this\ncase. Indeed, the inescapable conclusion from the statutory\ncontext is that in 1991 Congress intended that a preference for\nNative Hawaiians, in Hawaii, by a Native Hawaiian organiza-\ntion, located on the Hawaiian monarchy’s ancestral lands, be\nupheld because it furthers the urgent need for better education\nof Native Hawaiians, which Congress had identified explicitly\nin 1988.\n\n   The majority holds that § 1981 forbids all exclusive racial\npreferences (whether remedial or not) and suggests that politi-\ncal status is the only alternative justification for the Schools’\nexclusive preference for Native Hawaiians. See maj. op. at\n8951-52. Thus, the Schools’ concession that “Native Hawai-\nian” is a racial category, for purposes of this case, dooms its\npolicy under the majority’s view. See maj. op. at 8957-60. I\ndo not perceive such a dichotomy between the racial and the\n\f                 DOE v. KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS                  8967\npolitical aspects of the Schools’ preference for Native Hawai-\nian applicants. That is, if “Native Hawaiian” is indeed a racial\ncategory, then Congress has shown by its actions that an\nexclusive, remedial, racial preference can be permissible, at\nleast when it is employed to remedy demonstrable and\nextreme educational and socioeconomic deficiencies that are\nfaced by a racial group that (a) is descended from people\nwhose sovereignty and culture were upended and nearly\ndestroyed, in part by the actions of the United States, and (b)\nconsequently enjoys a special trust relationship with the\nUnited States government that parallels (but is not identical\nto) that between the federal government and Native Ameri-\ncans. These factors distinguish Native Hawaiians from the\nother racial groups mentioned by the majority, see maj. op. at\n8953-54, who have received special funding. In other words,\nwe need not decide that Native Hawaiians have any particular\npolitical status in order to recognize, as Congress has, that the\nKamehameha Schools pursue unique remedial objectives and\nmay, consistent with congressional intent, employ special\nremedial tools.\n\n   The Supreme Court has not established “a rigid formula for\ntesting the validity of an affirmative action plan” applied by\na private employer, Johnson v. Transp. Agency, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">770</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n757 (9th Cir. 1985), nor has it spoken at all to the operation\nof § 1981 with respect to remedial preferences at a private\nschool. In the absence of more specific Supreme Court guid-\nance, we should look directly to congressional intent. Con-\ngress clearly meant to allow for the private education of\nNative Hawaiian children at the Kamehameha Schools.\nBecause the statutory context demonstrates that Congress did\nnot intend for § 1981 to bar all exclusive preferences to rem-\nedy the severe educational deficits suffered by Native Hawai-\nians, a population unique within this country, and because\nKamehameha Schools has amply demonstrated that its admis-\nsion preference is regularly reviewed and currently required\nto combat those deficits, I respectfully dissent from the major-\nity’s contrary conclusion.\n\f</pre>",
