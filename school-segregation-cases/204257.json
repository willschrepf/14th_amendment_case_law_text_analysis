For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n                                 I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n         On December 10, 2003, Shaun Smith got in his father’s truck—a 2002 F350 diesel-engine\n\ntruck, with two front wheels and four rear wheels—and drove to Harrah’s casino in New Orleans.\n\n\n*\n Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published\nand is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\n                                                  -1-\n\fOver the course of an hour, he lost all of his money ($300–400) playing blackjack. While at the table,\n\nhe consumed between two and four alcoholic drinks. After losing, he went to retrieve his truck from\n\nvalet parking.\n\n       At the valet cashier’s desk, which was outside the casino next to the valet driveway, no other\n\ncustomers were in line, and Smith placed his valet ticket on the counter. Apparently not observing\n\nthis, the Harrah’s employee continued her other work behind the counter. At some point, the\n\nHarrah’s employee saw Smith’s valet ticket and told him that he owed ten dollars for parking.\n\n       There is some dispute as to the specific words exchanged during the twenty minutes after\n\nSmith was told he needed to pay for parking. The Harrah’s employees testified that Smith refused\n\nto pay and became verbally abusive, angry, and upset.1 The Harrah’s employees claim that Smith\n\nnever once said that he did not have the money to pay. Smith claims that he did not know he would\n\nhave to pay for valet parking, and in any event had lost all his money.\n\n       Before Smith refused to pay, however, a valet had been sent to retrieve Smith’s truck. The\n\nvalet did not have a radio and was not aware of the developing situation at the cashier’s desk. The\n\nvalet drove the truck into the pick-up area, and a few Harrah’s employees walked over to tell the\n\nvalet to re-park the truck. Smith, upon seeing his truck, walked diagonally across the driveway\n\ntoward the driver’s side door. He testified that he remembered that he had ten dollars in the center\n\nconsole. The Harrah’s employees claim that Smith never said anything about money in the truck and\n\ncontinued using abusive language. When Smith got to the driver’s side door, the valet, as instructed,\n\n\n\n1\n The Harrah’s witnesses testified that Smith “used the N-word” countless times in describing the\nblack security manager with whom he dealt, Stacey Dorsey, and further that he made statements such\nas “I own you” and “I owned your grandfather.” Smith admits to only using “the N-word” once but\nsays that he was set off by Dorsey’s calling him a “cracker” while refusing to retrieve his truck.\n\n                                                 -2-\n\ftried to drive away, but Smith grabbed onto the truck, and the valet stopped. The valet tried to drive\n\naway again, Smith grabbed again, and the valet stopped again. The third time the valet did not stop;\n\nSmith, holding onto the door’s rear-view mirror, fell. He was run over by at least one of the two left\n\nrear tires, which protrude out from the truck’s side.\n\n        While Smith was on the ground after being run over, all of the Harrah’s employees walked\n\naway. At trial, they variously testified that they were calling for medical assistance or were otherwise\n\ntrying to help or not aggravate the situation. Smith claims that Dorsey told him “[i]t serves you right”\n\nand walked away. The surveillance video that captured the scene shows all the employees walking\n\naway without urgency, leaving Smith on the ground unattended for a brief time. At some point, an\n\non-site first responder arrived, and an ambulance followed less than ten minutes later.\n\n        Smith suffered spiral fractures to his left tibia and fibula. He underwent open reduction and\n\ninternal fixation surgery, which resulted in a rod and screws being placed permanently in his left leg.\n\nSmith sued Harrah’s and won a jury trial, the outcome of which both parties now appeal.\n\n        With respect to the damages issues preserved for appeal, four expert witnesses provided\n\nrelevant testimony—Dr. Hamsa, Smith’s consulting physician; Dr. Roberts, Smith’s expert in the field\n\nof “vocational evaluation;” Dr. Stokes, called by Harrah’s as an expert in “vocational rehabilitation\n\ncounseling;”2 and Dr. Boudreaux, a Tulane professor and expert in forensic economics. Dr. Hamsa\n\ntestified that at the time of trial, Smith had a 20% impairment of the leg (not a 20% overall disability);\n\nthat Smith could not perform work standing up for a full day but could work half days; that Smith’s\n\ncondition would get at least somewhat better after physical therapy; and that Smith could return to\n\n\n\n2\n Dr. Stokes testified that he performs the same type of tests as Dr. Roberts but that he also performs\nactual job placement and counsels injured people who hope to return to the work force.\n\n                                                   -3-\n\fwork in some capacity in the future.\n\n        Dr. Roberts, who examined Smith on May 22, 2004, five months after the accident and five\n\nmonths before the trial, testified that Smith would not be able to return to work in outdoor activities,\n\nincluding horse training;3 that Smith would be able to return to the work force in some capacity,\n\nthough he would be limited to sedentary or light work; that, at the time of trial, Smith was not even\n\ncompetitive for positions at the sedentary level; and that Smith’s low educational accomplishments4\n\nwould preclude him from most sedentary jobs (the majority of which are professional in nature).\n\n        Dr. Stokes, who examined Smith on July 8, 2004, seven months after the accident and three\n\nmonths before trial, testified that Smith could return to the work force; that Smith had below-average\n\nvocabulary, reading skills, and reasoning ability but scored average in math; that Smith probably\n\nwould be able to return to part-time work with horses; and that jobs were available immediately in\n\nNew Orleans and Hot Springs, Arkansas (where Smith reported living), at the sedentary and light-\n\nduty level, paying between $6.50 and $11.91 per hour.\n\n        Dr. Boudreaux forecasted Smith’s lost future earnings. The main analysis was predicated on\n\nSmith earning $22,280 (the annualized amount of Smith’s weekly earnings prior to the accident) and\n\nhaving an average work-life expectancy of 31.84 more years. If Smith were to return to full-time\n\nemployment at $6.55 per hour, his lost future earnings, discounted to present value, would be\n\n$217,844; if Smith were to earn $10.05 per hour, his lost future earnings would be $46,508; for Smith\n\nnot to lose any future earnings, he would have to earn close to $11 per hour.\n\n\n3\n Smith testified that becoming a horse trainer was his career goal, though at the time of the incident\nhe was not working as a horse trainer.\n4\n  Dr. Roberts testified that Smith could perform mental math on a fourth grade level and read on a\nsixth grade level. His overall functioning was at the eighth grade level.\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f        The jury awarded Smith $2,400 for future medical expenses; $67,857 for past pain and\n\nsuffering; $18,571 for future pain and suffering; $5,500 for loss of past earnings; $474,573 for loss\n\nof future earnings; and $357,142 for loss of life enjoyment. Past medical expenses were stipulated\n\nat $23,006.03. The jury verdict allocated 67% fault to Harrah’s and 33% fault to Smith.\n\n        Harrah’s timely moved for a new trial or, in the alternative, remittitur, with respect to the fault\n\nallocation, lost-future-earnings award, and loss-of-life-enjoyment award. The district court denied\n\nthe motion. Harrah’s then timely appealed. Smith timely cross-appealed, claiming that the jury erred\n\nin allocating any fault to Smith and that the jury should have awarded him more damages for each\n\ncategory.\n\n                                   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        In the district court, Harrah’s moved for judgment as a matter of law (“JML”) under FED. R.\n\nCIV. P. 50(a) and subsequently renewed its JML motion under Rule 50(b) and, in the alternative,\n\nmoved for a new trial or remittitur. Harrah’s challenged the jury’s fault allocation, award for loss of\n\nfuture earnings, and award for loss of life enjoyment. On appeal, Harrah’s requests a new trial on the\n\nfault allocation (requesting a reduction to 0–20% for its portion of the fault), remittitur on the lost-\n\nfuture-earnings award (requesting it be reduced to $0), and remittitur on the loss-of-life-enjoyment\n\naward (requesting it be reduced to $50,000).\n\n        With respect to the jury’s allocation of fault, Harrah’s “must show that the facts and\n\ninferences point so strongly and overwhelming in [its] favor that reasonable persons could not arrive\n\nat a contrary verdict.” Gough v. Nat. Gas Pipeline Co. of Am., 996 F.2d 763, 768 (5th Cir. 1993);\n\nsee also Esposito v. Davis, 47 F.3d 164, 167 (5th Cir. 1995) (“While state law provides the\n\nsubstantive rules and tests in diversity cases, the applicable federal standard of review for a jury’s\n\n\n                                                   -5-\n\fverdict is one of reasonableness.”); Marcel v. Placid Oil Co., 11 F.3d 563, 566 (5th Cir. 1994)\n\n(similar). All of the facts and inferences must be viewed “in the light most favorable to the verdict.”\n\nPrestenbach v. Rains, 4 F.3d 358, 361 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n        With regard to remittitur on the damages amounts, because Harrah’s preserved its appellate\n\narguments with its motions below, this court reviews the district court’s denial of a new trial or\n\nremittitur for abuse of discretion. See Marcel, 11 F.3d at 568; Esposito, 47 F.3d at 167 (stating that,\n\nwhen a jury award is challenged through a motion for new trial or remittitur, the “standard of review\n\nis abuse of discretion of the district court, rather than the reasonableness of the jury’s award”).\n\n“Where a damage award is excessive or so large as to appear contrary to right reason, the award is\n\ngenerally subject to remittitur, not a new trial.” Marcel, 11 F.3d at 568; see also Seidman v. Am.\n\nAirlines, Inc., 923 F.2d 1134, 1140–41 (5th Cir. 1991) (“[I]n the area of evaluating whether a jury’s\n\naward is excessive, the appellate court should step lightly or not at all. A jury’s award should not be\n\ndisturbed unless it is entirely disproportionate to the injury sustained.” (internal quotation and citation\n\nomitted)).5\n\n        Awards for loss of future earnings are classified as “special damages” under Louisiana law\n\nbecause they may be determined with relative certainty. McDaniel v. Carencro Lions Club, 934 So.\n\n2d 945, 977 (La. Ct. App. 2006) (“Special damages are those damages which may be determined with\n\nsome degree of certainty and include past and future medical expenses and past and future lost\n\n\n5\n This court has\n       expressed the extent of distortion that warrants [appellate] intervention by requiring\n       such awards to be so large as to shock [the] judicial conscience, so gross or\n       inordinately large as to be contrary to right reason, so exaggerated as to indicate bias,\n       passion, prejudice, corruption, or other improper motive, or as clearly exceeding that\n       amount that any reasonable man could feel the claimant is entitled to.\nWilliams v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 875 F.2d 501, 506 (5th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n                                                   -6-\n\fwages.”).   “The plaintiff bears the burden of proving entitlement to special damages by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.” Id. If the jury awards greater special damages than plaintiff’s\n\nevidence could justify, Louisiana courts reduce the award to the highest amount justified by the\n\nevidence presented at trial. See Rayborn v. Diamond Offshore Co., 832 So. 2d 1052, 1058 (La. Ct.\n\nApp. 2002) (lost-past-earnings award reduced from $46,000 to $35,453, the amount estimated by\n\nthe testifying economist); Dennis v. The Finish Line, Inc., 781 So. 2d 12, 42 (La. Ct. App. 2000)\n\n(lost-future-earnings award reduced from $132,402 to $73,312.50, or “the highest reasonable amount\n\nsuggested by the [testifying] economists”).\n\n       Because general damages are “not susceptible to monetary quantification, . . . the jury thus\n\nnecessarily has especially broad leeway.” Seidman, 923 F.2d at 1141 (internal quotation omitted).\n\nAt least with respect to general damages, to determine whether an award is excessive, this court\n\ncompares the challenged awards “with rulings in other factually similar cases decided under\n\ncontrolling law, here Louisiana law.” Marcel, 11 F.3d at 568; see also Seidman, 923 F.2d at 1141\n\n(looking to state cases applying Louisiana law and involving comparable injuries for the upper limit);\n\nWilliams v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 875 F.2d 501, 506 (5th Cir. 1989) (“Whether this amount\n\nrepresents an excessive recovery cannot be determined solely by comparison to awards . . . in other\n\ncases. However, we examine past awards for rough guidance in assessing the award at hand.”\n\n(internal citation omitted)). If the general damages award is excessive in comparison to the other\n\nrulings, this court should not substitute its own judgment directly for the jury’s; rather, the court\n\nemploys the “maximum recovery rule” and reduces the award to 50% above the highest amount\n\nrecognized in other state law cases. See Salinas v. O’Neill, 286 F.3d 827, 831 & n.6 (5th Cir. 2002).\n\n       While Harrah’s preserved its arguments for appeal, Smith did not. He filed no post-verdict\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fmotions. “It is well-established that there can be no appellate review of allegedly excessive or\n\ninadequate damages if the trial court was not given the opportunity to exercise its discretion on a\n\nmotion for a new trial.” Bueno v. City of Donna, 714 F.2d 484, 493–94 (5th Cir. 1983). In such\n\ncases, onlyexceptional circumstances warrant appellate intervention. “Exceptional circumstances are\n\npresent when a pure question of law is involved and the asserted error is so obvious that the failure\n\nto consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice.” Vargas v. Lee, 317 F.3d 498, 499 n.1 (5th\n\nCir. 2003) (internal quotation omitted).\n\n                                        III. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Fault allocation\n\n       Harrah’s argues that the jury erred in finding that Smith was only 33% at fault. In this\n\ndiversity case, the district court properly instructed the jury on the applicable Louisiana law for\n\ncomparative fault. Under Louisiana law, a jury’s allocation of fault is directed by five factors:\n\n       (1) whether the conduct resulted from inadvertence or involved an awareness of the\n       danger, (2) how great a risk was created by the conduct, (3) the significance of what\n       was sought by the conduct, (4) the capacities of the actor, whether superior or\n       inferior, and (5) any extenuating circumstances which might require the actor to\n       proceed in haste, without proper thought.\n\nWatson v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co., 469 So. 2d 967, 974 (La. 1985). With respect to the first\n\nWatson factor, both parties’ conduct involved an awareness of the danger, rather than inadvertence.\n\nThe valet’s job involves a constant need to pay attention to pedestrian traffic. The valet clearly knew\n\nSmith was in the vicinity of the truck, since the valet stopped the truck twice before the accident at\n\nSmith’s behest. The valet, though, may not have realized that the dual rear tires protruded from the\n\nside of the truck. Smith, for his part, knew of the inherent danger of grabbing onto a moving vehicle.\n\n       As for the second Watson factor, both parties’ conduct created a great risk of danger. In\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fdeciding to drive the truck away, the valet created a danger of harming Smith. Before the accident,\n\nSmith already had grabbed onto the truck twice, showing his intention to do so again. Similarly, in\n\ngrabbing onto the truck, Smith created a great danger to himself.\n\n        With respect to the third Watson factor, neither party sought something significant. The valet\n\nneed not have driven away, since, according to Smith’s testimony, Smith told the valet (through the\n\nclosed window) that there was money in the center console. It was also not important that the truck\n\nleave immediately, as merelylocking the door would have prevented Smith from obtaining possession\n\nuntil he paid the valet fee. However, little or no importance can be ascribed to Smith’s conduct.\n\nNobody was stealing his truck; the valet service to whom he originally entrusted his truck was simply\n\nre-parking it.\n\n        With respect to the fourth Watson factor, Harrah’s had superior capabilities. The jury could\n\ninfer that Smith was impaired from the two to four drinks, and that Harrah’s knew of the impairment\n\nbecause some of its employees testified to smelling alcohol on Smith’s breath.\n\n        With respect to the fifth Watson factor, Smith probably had greater extenuating circumstances\n\nwhich caused him to act “without proper thought.” In the hour prior to the accident, Smith\n\nconsumed two to four beers (though the drinking was Smith’s own doing, the beers were provided\n\nby Harrah’s). As well, the jury could infer that Harrah’s precipitated the confrontation by repeatedly\n\nviolating its internal policies by failing to tell Smith how to avoid the valet parking fee.6 The jury also\n\n\n\n6\n  Several Harrah’s employees admitted that it is standard for them to tell a customer how to avoid\npaying for valet fees by, for example, becoming a preferred member of their frequent-customer\nprogram or getting parking “comped” from a pit boss after losing money at the tables. As well, the\nemployees testified that, had they known Smith had lost all his money, they would have told him how\nto get free parking. Each of the Harrah’s employees testified, essentially, that Smith was cursing so\nmuch that they could not explain how to avoid paying.\n\n                                                   -9-\n\fcould infer that a Harrah’s employee provoked Smith with a racial epithet, escalating the\n\nconfrontation. The jury could also have inferred that his anger was heightened by losing his money\n\nat the casino. However, the jury could also have determined that Smith provoked or escalated the\n\nsituation by using racial slurs, which would weigh in favor of Harrah’s. The allocation of fault\n\n“involve[s] credibility determinations and the resolution of disputed facts, findings at the very heart\n\nof the jury function.” Hardy v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 632, at *1 (5th Cir. 2000) (Table).\n\nThe district court should only have granted a new trial if the jury acted unreasonably in evaluating the\n\nevidence. Gough, 996 F.2d at 768. As shown above, the evidence is sufficient to support fault by\n\nboth parties. The allocation was within the province of the jury, and the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion by not upsetting the jury verdict.\n\nB.      Loss of future earnings\n\n        Awards for lost future earnings “are inherently speculative and intrinsically insusceptible of\n\nbeing calculated with mathematical certainty.” Melancon v. Lafayette Ins. Co., 926 So. 2d 693, 708\n\n(La. Ct. App. 2006) (internal quotation omitted). Accordingly, such damages need only be shown\n\nwith “such proof as reasonably establishes the plaintiff’s claim.” Id.; see also Gunn v. Robertson, 801\n\nSo. 2d 555, 565 (La. Ct. App. 2001) (“Future loss of earnings, which [is] inherently speculative, must\n\nbe proven with a reasonable degree of certainty, and purely conjectural or uncertain future loss of\n\nearnings will not be allowed.”).\n\n        Evidence showed that Smith would return to the workforce in some capacity, that Smith\n\ncould have obtained a GED, and that jobs were available to him. Smith’s primary basis for claiming\n\nextensive lost future earnings is that his dream of becoming a professional horse trainer has been\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -10-\n\fdestroyed by the accident. No evidence established the earnings of a horse trainer.7 Harrah’s argues\n\nthat the lost-future-earnings award was based on nothing but conjecture and speculation and cannot\n\nstand.    The incongruity between the past-earnings and future-earnings awards supports this\n\ncontention.\n\n         Contrary to Smith’s repeated argument, every medical and vocational expert testified that\n\nSmith will be able to re-enter the labor market. However, Smith argues, and evidence supports, that\n\nhe will not be able to reach his “ultimate goal” of becoming a horse trainer. As well, Smith will no\n\nlonger be able to operate a commercial vehicle, such as a large truck used for carrying horses, for\n\nwhich he held a commercial driver’s license. Smith’s vocational expert also testified that it would be\n\ndifficult for Smith to find a sedentary job because of his poor academic credentials.\n\n         Based on Dr. Boudreaux’s analysis, if Smith expected to make $22,880 yearly (the annualized\n\namount of his actual weekly earnings for the month prior to trial), and if Smith worked a low-paying\n\njob for the remainder of his work-life expectancy, he would suffer approximately $217,844 in lost\n\nfuture earnings.8 Since all evidence pointed to Smith’s being able to perform a sedentary or light-\n\nduty job, the only way for the jury to arrive at a $474,573 lost-future-earnings award was to assume\n\nthat (1) but for the accident Smith would have made substantially more than anything indicated by\n\nhis past work history; (2) Smith would be unable to hold or find a low-paid sedentary position; or\n\n(3) some combination of the two.\n\n         Reference to analogous cases is helpful, though not dispositive. In Seidman, this court\n\n\n7\n Smith made several attempts to introduce evidence of horse-trainer earnings, but the district court\nexcluded the proffered evidence as hearsay.\n8\n No economic expert testified for Smith, so the only evidence the jury had was Smith’s past earnings\nhistory and Dr. Boudreaux’s estimates.\n\n                                                -11-\n\fordered remittitur when the plaintiff’s earnings the year prior to the accident were “about $1,000 less\n\nthan she could earn with full-time minimum wage employment.” 923 F.2d at 1141. There, as here,\n\n“no one testified that [the plaintiff] would not be able to return to employment.” Id. In Williams,\n\nthis court upheld an award of $391,000 in future lost wages. 875 F.2d at 506. There, as here, the\n\njury heard evidence from the plaintiff about his work-life expectancy and pre-accident earnings. In\n\nWilliams, the plaintiff’s expert calculated the exact amount rendered by the jury verdict. In the\n\ninstant case, Smith did not offer an economic expert and all of the evidence showed that Smith could\n\nreturn to full-time work at a low-paying job. Nonetheless, the jury awarded Smith an amount twice\n\nas large as the defense expert’s calculations.\n\n        The weight of the evidence is clearly against the jury verdict, but whether the great weight\n\nis against the jury verdict, as is necessary to meet the standard for granting remittitur, is a closer\n\nquestion. We hold that the higher burden has been met, because no evidence presented to the jury\n\njustified a lost-future-earnings award of even 50% of what the jury awarded Smith. The maximum\n\namount a reasonable jury could have awarded, based on the evidence presented, is $217,844. We\n\nthus grant a remittitur and reduce Smith’s award for loss of future earnings to $217,844, or if Smith\n\nchooses not to accept the remitted award, a new trial on the issue of damages for loss of future\n\nearnings. Giles v. Gen. Elec. Co., 245 F.3d 474, 488 (5th Cir. 2001).\n\nC.      Loss of life enjoyment\n\n        “A plaintiff is entitled to recover damages for loss of life enjoyment if he proves that his\n\nlifestyle was detrimentally altered or if he was forced to give up activities because of his injury.” Day\n\nv. Ouachita Parish Sch. Bd., 823 So. 2d 1039, 1044 (La. Ct. App. 2002). Loss-of-life-enjoyment\n\ndamages can be awarded separately from other general damages, such as mental and physical pain\n\n\n                                                  -12-\n\fand suffering. See Stevenson v. La. Patient’s Comp. Fund, 710 So. 2d 1178, 1182 (La. Ct. App.\n\n1998).\n\n         Harrah’s argues that $357,142 is far too much compensation for Smith’s not being able to\n\nbowl, run, or play basketball. Instead, Harrah’s asks for remittitur to $50,000. Harrah’s cites a few\n\ncases where plaintiffs suffered dissimilar, though more severe, injuries and were granted far lower\n\ndamages. As well, Harrah’s attempts to show impropriety by comparing the high loss-of-life-\n\nenjoyment award to the lower pain-and-suffering and future-medical-expenses awards. There is no\n\ndirect correlation between these awards, and Harrah’s cites no authority. Smith may suffer loss of\n\nlife enjoyment although he is in little to no pain and does not require future surgery. It is uncontested\n\nthat he has 20% impairment of his leg, including some ankle and knee immobility. However, it also\n\nis uncontested that Smith was not yet at maximum medical improvement, and that it is uncertain as\n\nto how much his leg will heal in the future.\n\n         Smith argues that the jury award is based in part on the fact that Smith no longer will be able\n\nto become a horse trainer (which occupation was held by his father, grandfather, and great-\n\ngrandfather) and on his concomitant loss of self-worth. Smith advances a few other arguments,\n\nincluding that he had to “postpone his intended marriage” because of the loss of income; that he still\n\nsuffers nightmares reliving the incident; that he has moved into a house (his parents’) too small for\n\nhis extended family; and that he cannot play with his children, ride horses, bowl, or play basketball.\n\n         Smith’s strongest argument is that this court should focus, as do Louisiana state courts, on\n\nassessing total damages in globo rather than piecemeal. See, e.g., Richard v. Teague, 636 So. 2d\n\n1160, 1174 (La. Ct. App. 1994) (“In reviewing an award of general damages, a court of appeal is\n\nrequired to focus on the total award and not on each individual item.”). In this way, he hopes to have\n\n\n                                                  -13-\n\fthis court disregard any perceived jury indiscretion in the high loss-of-life-enjoyment award and treat\n\nsuch an award as general damages in combination with the pain-and-suffering awards. Smith cites\n\nto a few cases with comparable or lesser injuries and comparable or higher general damage awards.\n\nHere, however, the jury segregated each of the general damages awards as Smith asked it to do.\n\n       Behind Smith’s argument that this court should review the general damages award as a whole\n\nis an implicit recognition that, in most cases, loss-of-life-enjoyment awards are lower than pain-and-\n\nsuffering awards. While a general damages amount of $357,142 might not be excessive, such a large\n\nloss-of-life-enjoyment award goes beyond the norm.\n\n       Louisiana juries almost always grant lower loss-of-life-enjoyment awards than pain-and-\n\nsuffering awards. We recognize that each plaintiff and each injury is different and that neither the\n\nstate legislature nor the state courts have established a rule directing the proportion of the awards.\n\nHere, however, the large loss-of-life-enjoyment award is entirely disproportionate to any injury\n\nsuffered, past or future. A review of state cases reveals that courts have limited loss-of-life-\n\nenjoyment awards to $50,000 in cases with comparable and more serious injuries, and we hold that\n\nthis is the maximum amount the jury should have awarded. See Simms v. Progressive Ins. Co., 883\n\nSo. 2d 473, 488–89 (La. Ct. App. 2004) (loss-of-life-enjoyment award reduced to $50,000 from\n\n$225,000 when the plaintiff was eventually “able to resume her regular life activities”); Conner v.\n\nStelly, 830 So. 2d 1102, 1105, 1109 (La. Ct. App. 2002) (upholding a loss-of-life-enjoyment award\n\nof $50,000 when plaintiff conceived after a tubal ligation); Day v. Ouachita Parish Sch. Bd., 823 So.\n\n2d 1039, 1044 (La. Ct. App. 2002) (upholding a loss-of-life-enjoyment award of $50,000 when\n\nplaintiff injured his back and was unable to continue playing sports or pursue a strenuous occupation).\n\nTo determine the size of the remittitur, we add 50% to the maximum amount a jury could reasonably\n\n\n                                                 -14-\n\fhave awarded Smith. Giles, 245 F.3d at 488–89. We thus hold that Smith’s award is remitted to\n\n$75,000 for his loss of life enjoyment, with the option of a new trial on loss-of-life-enjoyment\n\ndamages if he chooses not to accept the remittitur.\n\nD.     Smith’s cross-appeal\n\n       As previously noted, Smith made no post-trial motions. Accordingly, this court should not\n\nintervene unless exceptional circumstances exist, wherein “a pure question of law is involved and the\n\nasserted error is so obvious that the failure to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice.”\n\nVargas, 317 F.3d at 499 n.1 (internal quotation omitted). Smith urges, largely without citation or\n\nrecord support, that the jury’s damages determinations should be increased with respect to his future\n\nmedical expenses, loss of past earnings, and past and future pain and suffering. His arguments fail\n\nto show the presence of exceptional circumstances warranting relief. Accordingly, we deny all of\n\nSmith’s claims on cross-appeal.\n\n                                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the jury’s findings on allocation of fault, REVERSE\n\nthe district court’s decision on remittitur, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -15-\n\f",

For the reasons stated below, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n                                 I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n         On December 10, 2003, Shaun Smith got in his father’s truck—a 2002 F350 diesel-engine\n\ntruck, with two front wheels and four rear wheels—and drove to Harrah’s casino in New Orleans.\n\n\n*\n Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published\nand is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\n                                                  -1-\n\fOver the course of an hour, he lost all of his money ($300–400) playing blackjack. While at the table,\n\nhe consumed between two and four alcoholic drinks. After losing, he went to retrieve his truck from\n\nvalet parking.\n\n       At the valet cashier’s desk, which was outside the casino next to the valet driveway, no other\n\ncustomers were in line, and Smith placed his valet ticket on the counter. Apparently not observing\n\nthis, the Harrah’s employee continued her other work behind the counter. At some point, the\n\nHarrah’s employee saw Smith’s valet ticket and told him that he owed ten dollars for parking.\n\n       There is some dispute as to the specific words exchanged during the twenty minutes after\n\nSmith was told he needed to pay for parking. The Harrah’s employees testified that Smith refused\n\nto pay and became verbally abusive, angry, and upset.1 The Harrah’s employees claim that Smith\n\nnever once said that he did not have the money to pay. Smith claims that he did not know he would\n\nhave to pay for valet parking, and in any event had lost all his money.\n\n       Before Smith refused to pay, however, a valet had been sent to retrieve Smith’s truck. The\n\nvalet did not have a radio and was not aware of the developing situation at the cashier’s desk. The\n\nvalet drove the truck into the pick-up area, and a few Harrah’s employees walked over to tell the\n\nvalet to re-park the truck. Smith, upon seeing his truck, walked diagonally across the driveway\n\ntoward the driver’s side door. He testified that he remembered that he had ten dollars in the center\n\nconsole. The Harrah’s employees claim that Smith never said anything about money in the truck and\n\ncontinued using abusive language. When Smith got to the driver’s side door, the valet, as instructed,\n\n\n\n1\n The Harrah’s witnesses testified that Smith “used the N-word” countless times in describing the\nblack security manager with whom he dealt, Stacey Dorsey, and further that he made statements such\nas “I own you” and “I owned your grandfather.” Smith admits to only using “the N-word” once but\nsays that he was set off by Dorsey’s calling him a “cracker” while refusing to retrieve his truck.\n\n                                                 -2-\n\ftried to drive away, but Smith grabbed onto the truck, and the valet stopped. The valet tried to drive\n\naway again, Smith grabbed again, and the valet stopped again. The third time the valet did not stop;\n\nSmith, holding onto the door’s rear-view mirror, fell. He was run over by at least one of the two left\n\nrear tires, which protrude out from the truck’s side.\n\n        While Smith was on the ground after being run over, all of the Harrah’s employees walked\n\naway. At trial, they variously testified that they were calling for medical assistance or were otherwise\n\ntrying to help or not aggravate the situation. Smith claims that Dorsey told him “[i]t serves you right”\n\nand walked away. The surveillance video that captured the scene shows all the employees walking\n\naway without urgency, leaving Smith on the ground unattended for a brief time. At some point, an\n\non-site first responder arrived, and an ambulance followed less than ten minutes later.\n\n        Smith suffered spiral fractures to his left tibia and fibula. He underwent open reduction and\n\ninternal fixation surgery, which resulted in a rod and screws being placed permanently in his left leg.\n\nSmith sued Harrah’s and won a jury trial, the outcome of which both parties now appeal.\n\n        With respect to the damages issues preserved for appeal, four expert witnesses provided\n\nrelevant testimony—Dr. Hamsa, Smith’s consulting physician; Dr. Roberts, Smith’s expert in the field\n\nof “vocational evaluation;” Dr. Stokes, called by Harrah’s as an expert in “vocational rehabilitation\n\ncounseling;”2 and Dr. Boudreaux, a Tulane professor and expert in forensic economics. Dr. Hamsa\n\ntestified that at the time of trial, Smith had a 20% impairment of the leg (not a 20% overall disability);\n\nthat Smith could not perform work standing up for a full day but could work half days; that Smith’s\n\ncondition would get at least somewhat better after physical therapy; and that Smith could return to\n\n\n\n2\n Dr. Stokes testified that he performs the same type of tests as Dr. Roberts but that he also performs\nactual job placement and counsels injured people who hope to return to the work force.\n\n                                                   -3-\n\fwork in some capacity in the future.\n\n        Dr. Roberts, who examined Smith on May 22, 2004, five months after the accident and five\n\nmonths before the trial, testified that Smith would not be able to return to work in outdoor activities,\n\nincluding horse training;3 that Smith would be able to return to the work force in some capacity,\n\nthough he would be limited to sedentary or light work; that, at the time of trial, Smith was not even\n\ncompetitive for positions at the sedentary level; and that Smith’s low educational accomplishments4\n\nwould preclude him from most sedentary jobs (the majority of which are professional in nature).\n\n        Dr. Stokes, who examined Smith on July 8, 2004, seven months after the accident and three\n\nmonths before trial, testified that Smith could return to the work force; that Smith had below-average\n\nvocabulary, reading skills, and reasoning ability but scored average in math; that Smith probably\n\nwould be able to return to part-time work with horses; and that jobs were available immediately in\n\nNew Orleans and Hot Springs, Arkansas (where Smith reported living), at the sedentary and light-\n\nduty level, paying between $6.50 and $11.91 per hour.\n\n        Dr. Boudreaux forecasted Smith’s lost future earnings. The main analysis was predicated on\n\nSmith earning $22,280 (the annualized amount of Smith’s weekly earnings prior to the accident) and\n\nhaving an average work-life expectancy of 31.84 more years. If Smith were to return to full-time\n\nemployment at $6.55 per hour, his lost future earnings, discounted to present value, would be\n\n$217,844; if Smith were to earn $10.05 per hour, his lost future earnings would be $46,508; for Smith\n\nnot to lose any future earnings, he would have to earn close to $11 per hour.\n\n\n3\n Smith testified that becoming a horse trainer was his career goal, though at the time of the incident\nhe was not working as a horse trainer.\n4\n  Dr. Roberts testified that Smith could perform mental math on a fourth grade level and read on a\nsixth grade level. His overall functioning was at the eighth grade level.\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f        The jury awarded Smith $2,400 for future medical expenses; $67,857 for past pain and\n\nsuffering; $18,571 for future pain and suffering; $5,500 for loss of past earnings; $474,573 for loss\n\nof future earnings; and $357,142 for loss of life enjoyment. Past medical expenses were stipulated\n\nat $23,006.03. The jury verdict allocated 67% fault to Harrah’s and 33% fault to Smith.\n\n        Harrah’s timely moved for a new trial or, in the alternative, remittitur, with respect to the fault\n\nallocation, lost-future-earnings award, and loss-of-life-enjoyment award. The district court denied\n\nthe motion. Harrah’s then timely appealed. Smith timely cross-appealed, claiming that the jury erred\n\nin allocating any fault to Smith and that the jury should have awarded him more damages for each\n\ncategory.\n\n                                   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        In the district court, Harrah’s moved for judgment as a matter of law (“JML”) under FED. R.\n\nCIV. P. 50(a) and subsequently renewed its JML motion under Rule 50(b) and, in the alternative,\n\nmoved for a new trial or remittitur. Harrah’s challenged the jury’s fault allocation, award for loss of\n\nfuture earnings, and award for loss of life enjoyment. On appeal, Harrah’s requests a new trial on the\n\nfault allocation (requesting a reduction to 0–20% for its portion of the fault), remittitur on the lost-\n\nfuture-earnings award (requesting it be reduced to $0), and remittitur on the loss-of-life-enjoyment\n\naward (requesting it be reduced to $50,000).\n\n        With respect to the jury’s allocation of fault, Harrah’s “must show that the facts and\n\ninferences point so strongly and overwhelming in [its] favor that reasonable persons could not arrive\n\nat a contrary verdict.” Gough v.

DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Fault allocation\n\n       Harrah’s argues that the jury erred in finding that Smith was only 33% at fault. In this\n\ndiversity case, the district court properly instructed the jury on the applicable Louisiana law for\n\ncomparative fault. Under Louisiana law, a jury’s allocation of fault is directed by five factors:\n\n       (1) whether the conduct resulted from inadvertence or involved an awareness of the\n       danger, (2) how great a risk was created by the conduct, (3) the significance of what\n       was sought by the conduct, (4) the capacities of the actor, whether superior or\n       inferior, and (5) any extenuating circumstances which might require the actor to\n       proceed in haste, without proper thought.\n\nWatson v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1683515\"><a href=\"/opinion/1683515/watson-v-state-farm-fire-and-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974 (La. 1985). With respect to the first\n\nWatson factor, both parties’ conduct involved an awareness of the danger, rather than inadvertence.\n\nThe valet’s job involves a constant need to pay attention to pedestrian traffic. The valet clearly knew\n\nSmith was in the vicinity of the truck, since the valet stopped the truck twice before the accident at\n\nSmith’s behest. The valet, though, may not have realized that the dual rear tires protruded from the\n\nside of the truck. Smith, for his part, knew of the inherent danger of grabbing onto a moving vehicle.\n\n       As for the second Watson factor, both parties’ conduct created a great risk of danger. In\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fdeciding to drive the truck away, the valet created a danger of harming Smith. Before the accident,\n\nSmith already had grabbed onto the truck twice, showing his intention to do so again. Similarly, in\n\ngrabbing onto the truck, Smith created a great danger to himself.\n\n        With respect to the third Watson factor, neither party sought something significant. The valet\n\nneed not have driven away, since, according to Smith’s testimony, Smith told the valet (through the\n\nclosed window) that there was money in the center console. It was also not important that the truck\n\nleave immediately, as merelylocking the door would have prevented Smith from obtaining possession\n\nuntil he paid the valet fee. However, little or no importance can be ascribed to Smith’s conduct.\n\nNobody was stealing his truck; the valet service to whom he originally entrusted his truck was simply\n\nre-parking it.\n\n        With respect to the fourth Watson factor, Harrah’s had superior capabilities. The jury could\n\ninfer that Smith was impaired from the two to four drinks, and that Harrah’s knew of the impairment\n\nbecause some of its employees testified to smelling alcohol on Smith’s breath.\n\n        With respect to the fifth Watson factor, Smith probably had greater extenuating circumstances\n\nwhich caused him to act “without proper thought.” In the hour prior to the accident, Smith\n\nconsumed two to four beers (though the drinking was Smith’s own doing, the beers were provided\n\nby Harrah’s). As well, the jury could infer that Harrah’s precipitated the confrontation by repeatedly\n\nviolating its internal policies by failing to tell Smith how to avoid the valet parking fee.6 The jury also\n\n\n\n6\n  Several Harrah’s employees admitted that it is standard for them to tell a customer how to avoid\npaying for valet fees by, for example, becoming a preferred member of their frequent-customer\nprogram or getting parking “comped” from a pit boss after losing money at the tables. As well, the\nemployees testified that, had they known Smith had lost all his money, they would have told him how\nto get free parking. Each of the Harrah’s employees testified, essentially, that Smith was cursing so\nmuch that they could not explain how to avoid paying.\n\n                                                   -9-\n\fcould infer that a Harrah’s employee provoked Smith with a racial epithet, escalating the\n\nconfrontation. The jury could also have inferred that his anger was heightened by losing his money\n\nat the casino. However, the jury could also have determined that Smith provoked or escalated the\n\nsituation by using racial slurs, which would weigh in favor of Harrah’s. The allocation of fault\n\n“involve[s] credibility determinations and the resolution of disputed facts, findings at the very heart\n\nof the jury function.” Hardy v.

Gough, 996 F.2d at 768. As shown above, the evidence is sufficient to support fault by\n\nboth parties. The allocation was within the province of the jury, and the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion by not upsetting the jury verdict.\n\nB.      Loss of future earnings\n\n        Awards for lost future earnings “are inherently speculative and intrinsically insusceptible of\n\nbeing calculated with mathematical certainty.” Melancon v.

Robertson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1881805\"><a href=\"/opinion/1881805/gunn-v-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (La. Ct. App. 2001) (“Future loss of earnings, which [is] inherently speculative, must\n\nbe proven with a reasonable degree of certainty, and purely conjectural or uncertain future loss of\n\nearnings will not be allowed.”).\n\n        Evidence showed that Smith would return to the workforce in some capacity, that Smith\n\ncould have obtained a GED, and that jobs were available to him. Smith’s primary basis for claiming\n\nextensive lost future earnings is that his dream of becoming a professional horse trainer has been\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -10-\n\fdestroyed by the accident. No evidence established the earnings of a horse trainer.7 Harrah’s argues\n\nthat the lost-future-earnings award was based on nothing but conjecture and speculation and cannot\n\nstand.    The incongruity between the past-earnings and future-earnings awards supports this\n\ncontention.\n\n         Contrary to Smith’s repeated argument, every medical and vocational expert testified that\n\nSmith will be able to re-enter the labor market. However, Smith argues, and evidence supports, that\n\nhe will not be able to reach his “ultimate goal” of becoming a horse trainer. As well, Smith will no\n\nlonger be able to operate a commercial vehicle, such as a large truck used for carrying horses, for\n\nwhich he held a commercial driver’s license. Smith’s vocational expert also testified that it would be\n\ndifficult for Smith to find a sedentary job because of his poor academic credentials.\n\n         Based on Dr. Boudreaux’s analysis, if Smith expected to make $22,880 yearly (the annualized\n\namount of his actual weekly earnings for the month prior to trial), and if Smith worked a low-paying\n\njob for the remainder of his work-life expectancy, he would suffer approximately $217,844 in lost\n\nfuture earnings.8 Since all evidence pointed to Smith’s being able to perform a sedentary or light-\n\nduty job, the only way for the jury to arrive at a $474,573 lost-future-earnings award was to assume\n\nthat (1) but for the accident Smith would have made substantially more than anything indicated by\n\nhis past work history; (2) Smith would be unable to hold or find a low-paid sedentary position; or\n\n(3) some combination of the two.\n\n         Reference to analogous cases is helpful, though not dispositive. In Seidman, this court\n\n\n7\n Smith made several attempts to introduce evidence of horse-trainer earnings, but the district court\nexcluded the proffered evidence as hearsay.\n8\n No economic expert testified for Smith, so the only evidence the jury had was Smith’s past earnings\nhistory and Dr. Boudreaux’s estimates.\n\n                                                -11-\n\fordered remittitur when the plaintiff’s earnings the year prior to the accident were “about $1,000 less\n\nthan she could earn with full-time minimum wage employment.” 923 F.2d at 1141. There, as here,\n\n“no one testified that [the plaintiff] would not be able to return to employment.” Id. In Williams,\n\nthis court upheld an award of $391,000 in future lost wages. 875 F.2d at 506. There, as here, the\n\njury heard evidence from the plaintiff about his work-life expectancy and pre-accident earnings. In\n\nWilliams, the plaintiff’s expert calculated the exact amount rendered by the jury verdict. In the\n\ninstant case, Smith did not offer an economic expert and all of the evidence showed that Smith could\n\nreturn to full-time work at a low-paying job. Nonetheless, the jury awarded Smith an amount twice\n\nas large as the defense expert’s calculations.\n\n        The weight of the evidence is clearly against the jury verdict, but whether the great weight\n\nis against the jury verdict, as is necessary to meet the standard for granting remittitur, is a closer\n\nquestion. We hold that the higher burden has been met, because no evidence presented to the jury\n\njustified a lost-future-earnings award of even 50% of what the jury awarded Smith. The maximum\n\namount a reasonable jury could have awarded, based on the evidence presented, is $217,844. We\n\nthus grant a remittitur and reduce Smith’s award for loss of future earnings to $217,844, or if Smith\n\nchooses not to accept the remitted award, a new trial on the issue of damages for loss of future\n\nearnings.

Ct. App.\n\n1998).\n\n         Harrah’s argues that $357,142 is far too much compensation for Smith’s not being able to\n\nbowl, run, or play basketball. Instead, Harrah’s asks for remittitur to $50,000. Harrah’s cites a few\n\ncases where plaintiffs suffered dissimilar, though more severe, injuries and were granted far lower\n\ndamages. As well, Harrah’s attempts to show impropriety by comparing the high loss-of-life-\n\nenjoyment award to the lower pain-and-suffering and future-medical-expenses awards. There is no\n\ndirect correlation between these awards, and Harrah’s cites no authority. Smith may suffer loss of\n\nlife enjoyment although he is in little to no pain and does not require future surgery. It is uncontested\n\nthat he has 20% impairment of his leg, including some ankle and knee immobility. However, it also\n\nis uncontested that Smith was not yet at maximum medical improvement, and that it is uncertain as\n\nto how much his leg will heal in the future.\n\n         Smith argues that the jury award is based in part on the fact that Smith no longer will be able\n\nto become a horse trainer (which occupation was held by his father, grandfather, and great-\n\ngrandfather) and on his concomitant loss of self-worth. Smith advances a few other arguments,\n\nincluding that he had to “postpone his intended marriage” because of the loss of income; that he still\n\nsuffers nightmares reliving the incident; that he has moved into a house (his parents’) too small for\n\nhis extended family; and that he cannot play with his children, ride horses, bowl, or play basketball.\n\n         Smith’s strongest argument is that this court should focus, as do Louisiana state courts, on\n\nassessing total damages in globo rather than piecemeal. See, e.g., Richard v. Teague, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788218\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788218/richard-v-teague/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174 (La. Ct. App. 1994) (“In reviewing an award of general damages, a court of appeal is\n\nrequired to focus on the total award and not on each individual item.”). In this way, he hopes to have\n\n\n                                                  -13-\n\fthis court disregard any perceived jury indiscretion in the high loss-of-life-enjoyment award and treat\n\nsuch an award as general damages in combination with the pain-and-suffering awards. Smith cites\n\nto a few cases with comparable or lesser injuries and comparable or higher general damage awards.\n\nHere, however, the jury segregated each of the general damages awards as Smith asked it to do.\n\n       Behind Smith’s argument that this court should review the general damages award as a whole\n\nis an implicit recognition that, in most cases, loss-of-life-enjoyment awards are lower than pain-and-\n\nsuffering awards. While a general damages amount of $357,142 might not be excessive, such a large\n\nloss-of-life-enjoyment award goes beyond the norm.\n\n       Louisiana juries almost always grant lower loss-of-life-enjoyment awards than pain-and-\n\nsuffering awards. We recognize that each plaintiff and each injury is different and that neither the\n\nstate legislature nor the state courts have established a rule directing the proportion of the awards.\n\nHere, however, the large loss-of-life-enjoyment award is entirely disproportionate to any injury\n\nsuffered, past or future. A review of state cases reveals that courts have limited loss-of-life-\n\nenjoyment awards to $50,000 in cases with comparable and more serious injuries, and we hold that\n\nthis is the maximum amount the jury should have awarded.
