The complaint alleges the children have been denied admission to schools attended by white children under Article 12, § 1 of the Constitution of Louisiana, LSA-Const., and Louisiana Acts 555 and 556 of 1954, LSA-R.S. 17:331 et seq., 17:81.1 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*337</span> and note, requiring segregation of the races in public elementary and high schools of the state.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of the United States in Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 75 S.Ct. 753, 755, 99 L.Ed. 1083, in dealing with this identical situation with reference to the states of Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia and Delaware, wrote as follows: \"These cases were decided on May 17, 1954. The opinions of that date, declaring the fundamental principle that racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional, are incorporated herein by reference.<sup>[1]</sup> All provisions of federal, state, or local law requiring or permitting such discrimination must yield to this principle.\" In so far as the provisions of the Louisiana Constitution and statutes in suit require or permit segregation of the races in public schools,<sup>[2]</sup> they are invalid under the ruling of the Supreme Court in Brown.</p>\n<p>This three-judge court was convened under 28 U.S.C. § 2281 pursuant to the requests of the parties. It now appears that no serious constitutional question, not heretofore decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, is presented. Accordingly, a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. § 2281 is not required. Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152.
