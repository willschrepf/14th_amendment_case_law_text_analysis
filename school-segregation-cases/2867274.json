In response to a FOIA request by Davin, the FBI\n\nsubmitted to the district court a Vaughn index that set forth\n\ncoded justifications and corresponding explanations for its\n\nwithholding of approximately 7,400 pages of information.     Because\n\nthe Vaughn index submitted by the government did not sufficiently\n\ndescribe the information withheld, the district court did not\n\nhave an adequate factual basis for determining whether the\n\nclaimed exemptions applied to the individual documents.\n\nAccordingly, we will reverse the order of the district court and\n\nremand this matter for further determinations consistent with\n\nprinciples articulated in this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                I.\n\n           Davin is a graduate history student at the University\n\nof Pittsburgh in the field of labor history.   In order to\n\ncomplete his doctoral dissertation, in April 1986 Davin filed a\n\nFOIA request with the FBI seeking \"a complete and thorough search\n\nof all filing systems and locations for all records . . .\n\npertaining to David Lasser and The Workers Alliance of America.\"\n\nApp. at 99 (emphasis in original).   The Workers Alliance of\n\n\n\n                                2\n\fAmerica (\"WAA\") was a nationwide organization representing the\n\ninterests of thousands of unemployed individuals during the\n\n1930's and 1940's.   For a time, the WAA was headed by David\n\nLasser.   Because the WAA did not keep minutes of its meetings,\n\nthere are no other archives of information on its activities.\n\nLasser, who is now in his nineties, has provided the FBI with a\n\nletter authorizing release of his files.\n\n          The WAA was investigated by the FBI during the 1930's\n\nafter the FBI received information that the organization was a\n\nfront for the Communist Party of America.   The purpose of the\n\ninvestigation was to determine the extent of Communist influence,\n\nand the identity of WAA members who were members of the Communist\n\nParty at the time.   The FBI also investigated Lasser.   According\n\nto the FBI, Communists had captured positions of control within\n\nthe WAA by 1936.   In 1940, Lasser resigned, claiming the WAA was\n\na front organization for the Communist Party.\n\n          In response to Davin's request, the FBI located nine\n\nrelevant files at either national headquarters or at the New York\n\nfield office. The FBI described the files as follows:\n          FBIHQ main file, 61-7586, (45 sections)\n          corresponds to NYFO main file, 100-3638, (6\n          sections). Both files pertain to an internal\n          security investigation and were compiled for\n          law enforcement purposes. A 61\n          classification is entitled \"Treason or\n          Misprision of Treason\" and involves\n          violations of Title 18, U.S.C., Sections\n          2381, 2382, 2389, 2390, 756 and 757. A 100\n          classification is entitled \"Domestic\n          Security\" and covers investigations by the\n          FBI in the domestic security field; e.g.,\n          Smith Act violations. The Attorney General\n          declared WAA to be within the purview of\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fExecutive Order 9835, and later Executive\nOrder 10450. The first serial is dated March\n5, 1936, and the last serial is dated October\n21, 1960. . . .\nFBIHQ main file, 124-2592 is a loyalty\ninvestigation of David Lasser consisting of\ntwo sections. This classification covers\nsecurity and loyalty investigations of\npersonnel employed by or under consideration\nof employment with the European Recovery\nProgram. Investigation was conducted under\nPublic Law 472, 80th Congress. The first\nserial in this file is dated January 25,\n1949, and the last serial is dated October\n29, 1951.\n\nFBIHQ main file 121-413, (Loyalty of\nGovernment Employees) consisting of one\nsection, pertains to a preliminary inquiry to\nascertain if David Lasser was associated with\nthe Communist Party or its front\norganizations. Investigation of David Lasser\nunder the provision of Executive Order 9835 .\n. . was instituted by the FBI on April 22,\n1948. The first serial of this file is dated\nOctober 24, 1947, and the last serial is\ndated October 30, 1963.\n\nFBIHQ main file, 151-748 involves one\nsection. This classification covers\nreferrals from the Office of Personnel\nManagement where an allegation has been\nreceived regarding an applicant's loyalty to\nthe U.S. Government. The Agency for\nInternational Development had requested the\nFBI to conduct a full field investigation\nunder the provisions of Public Law 298, The\nForeign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.\nDavid Lasser was interviewed by the FBI in\n1963 under the provisions of Executive Order\n10450 . . . . The first serial is dated\nDecember 12, 1963, and the last serial in\nthis file is dated January 29, 1976.\n\nFBIHQ main file, 126-706 consists of one\nsection concerning a name check request on\nDavid Lasser for clearance for access to\nhighly classified material by National\nSecurity Resources Board. This\nclassification covers background\n\n\n                     4\n\f          investigation conducted on individuals who\n          are to be assigned to duties under the\n          International Development Program. The first\n          and last serials are dated November 14, 1950,\n          and November 15, 1950, respectively.\n\n          FBIHQ main file 65-66314, (Espionage)\n          consisting of one section which contains\n          documentation based on information received\n          concerning the possibility that David Lasser\n          could be some individual who could divert\n          information to the detriment of the defense\n          of the United States. No investigation was\n          conducted. This file was opened on September\n          22, 1960 and closed on September 27, 1960.\n\n          FBIHQ main file, 47-13920 is a two-page file\n          which contains information that a\n          representative of WAA had made a claim that\n          he had authority from the Federal Government\n          to represent individuals in claims of various\n          municipalities. This file was opened and\n          closed on February 19, 1938. This\n          classification is entitled \"Impersonation\"\n          and covers violations of Title 18, U.S.C.,\n          Sections 912, 913, 915, and 916.\n\n          FBIHQ main file, 61-10652 (two sections) was\n          initially compiled to determine if David\n          Lasser might act as an informant for the FBI\n          or if he would be willing to supply details\n          concerning Communist Party activities in WAA.\n          The first serial of this file is dated June\n          20, 1940, and the last document in the file\n          is dated February 8, 1951.\n\nDeclaration of Special Agent Robert A. Moran, App. at 60-63\n(footnotes omitted) [hereinafter all citations to the Appendix\nrefer to the Moran declaration].\n\n\n          The FBI asserts that its records relating to the WAA\n\ntotal approximately 9,200 pages and its records on David Lasser\n\ncontain approximately 1,200 pages.   As of May 18, 1991, the FBI\n\nhad released to Davin only 113 pages regarding the WAA and 150\n\npages on Lasser.\n\n\n\n                               5\n\f           In April 1992, Davin filed a complaint for injunctive\n\nrelief demanding the production of the documents.     Subsequently,\n\npursuant to an agreement between the parties, Davin and the\n\ngovernment submitted a joint motion to stay the case for 130 days\n\nto permit the government to submit a Vaughn index.1    This motion\n\nstipulated that the FBI had reviewed 6,889 documents pursuant to\n\nDavin's FOIA request, had released 2,970 pages to Davin, and\n\nclaimed exemptions to the remaining 3,919 pages.    The joint\n\nmotion further provided that the government would select\n\napproximately 500 documents (roughly every fourteenth or\n\nfifteenth page), compile a Vaughn index and submit it to the\n\ncourt with a motion for summary judgment.\n\n           Included in the government's subsequent motion for\n\nsummary judgment was a declaration by FBI Special Agent Robert\n\nMoran.   The purpose of Moran's declaration was to provide the\n\ncourt and Davin with a description of the material being withheld\n\nand justifications for the government's assertions of FOIA\n\nexemptions to withhold certain information contained in the\n\nrecords.   The declaration consisted of correspondences concerning\n\nDavin's request, an explanation of the FBI's central records\n\nsystem and electronic surveillance index, a list of records\n\npertaining to Davin's request, a sampling and definition of\n\n\n1\nA Vaughn index is an index correlating each withheld document,\nor a portion thereof, with a specific exemption and relevant part\nof an agency's justification for nondisclosure. The Vaughn index\nis a tool designed to aid the court in determining whether the\nagency has properly withheld the information requested. See\nVaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (Vaughn I), cert.\ndenied, 415 U.S. 977, 94 S. Ct. 1564 (1974).\n\n\n                                6\n\fdocuments, a detailed explanation of the coded format used for\n\njustification of deleted material, and the justification for\n\nredacted materials.\n\n          A sampling of 500 pages was selected from the files.\n\nEach page was identified with a document number and indicated the\n\nfile from which it came.   An explanation of the types of\n\ndocuments in the sampling was also supplied.   Portions of the\n\ndocuments were redacted.   Located in proximity to the redacted\n\nmaterial was a series of letters and numbers which corresponded\n\nto specific FOIA exemptions.   In those instances where an entire\n\npage was redacted, justification code numbers for the withholding\n\nwere substituted for the deleted page.\n\n          To determine the pertinent justification for deleted\n\nmaterial on each processed document, the reader would refer to\n\nthe document in question, note the code number adjacent to the\n\ndeleted material and refer to the corresponding code categories.\n\nThe memorandum then listed twenty-seven justification categories\n\nfor withholding information, along with an explanation of the\n\nvarious categories.\n\n          Moran's declaration listed the FBI Main Files regarding\n\nLasser and the WAA, but did not contain any factual description\n\nof the specific documents and portions of the documents withheld.\n\nInstead, Special Agent Moran offered generic explanations of the\n\n\"justification categories\" used to encode the Vaughn index.    No\n\nspecific index was created to factually link the generic\n\ndescriptions with the encoded deletions, and the explanations\n\nthemselves did not refer to Lasser or the WAA or any other fact\n\n                                7\n\fconnected with this action.    No attempt was made to provide an\n\nindividual rationale for the withholding of specific information.\n\n\n\n          The government asserted that of the 10,400 pages\n\nidentified (9,200 on the WAA and 1,200 on Lasser), 2,970 had been\n\nreleased to Davin and that the remaining pages were being\n\nwithheld under the following FOIA exemptions: (1) Category\n\n(b)(7)(C) Unwarranted Invasion of Personal Privacy; (2) Category\n\n(b)(7)(D) Confidential Source Material; (3) Category (b)(7)(E)\n\nInvestigative Techniques and Procedures; and (4) Category (b)(2)\n\nInformation related Solely to the Internal Personnel Rules and\n\nPractices of an Agency.\n\n          Following receipt of the declaration and exhibits,\n\nDavin filed a motion to compel production of documents for in\n\ncamera review, arguing that the district court could not make an\n\naccurate determination of the validity of the redactions based\n\nupon the government's Vaughn index without review of the\n\ndocuments.    Davin asserted that the government had failed to\n\nprovide any factual information describing the individual\n\ndocuments withheld and thus failed to demonstrate the\n\napplicability of the exemptions it claimed.\n\n             The district court ordered an evidentiary hearing in\n\nwhich Agent Moran testified about twenty-five of the\n\napproximately 7,400 documents that had been withheld.    These\n\ndocuments were selected by Davin from the \"Treason or Misprision\n\nof Treason\" file.    Twenty-two of these pages were blackened out\n\nin their entirety.    Agent Moran described the various categories\n\n                                  8\n\funder which the documents were withheld, although he did not\n\ntestify to the contents of the withheld documents themselves.\n\n           The district court held that Agent Moran's testimony,\n\ntogether with the Vaughn index, demonstrated with \"reasonable\n\nspecificity\" why the documents were exempt from disclosure.\n\nAccordingly, the district court granted the government's motion\n\nfor summary judgment and denied Davin's motion to compel in\n\ncamera examination.   This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                               II.\n\n           A two-tiered test governs our review of an order of the\n\ndistrict court granting summary judgment in proceedings seeking\n\ndisclosure of information under FOIA.   We must \"first decide\n\nwhether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its\n\ndetermination.\"   McDonnell v. United States, 4 F.3d 1227, 1242\n\n(3d Cir. 1993) (citing Patterson by Patterson v. FBI, 893 F.2d\n\n595, 600 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 812, 111 S. Ct. 48\n\n(1990)).   This review is de novo and requires us to examine the\naffidavits below to determine \"whether the agency's explanation\n\nwas full and specific enough to afford the FOIA requester a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to contest, and the district court an\n\nadequate foundation to review, the soundness of the withholding.\"\n\nId. (quoting King v. Department of Justice, 830 F.2d 210, 217-18\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f          After reviewing the affidavits, \"[i]f this Court\n\nconcludes that the affidavits presented a sufficient factual\n\nbasis for the district court's determination, it must then decide\n\nwhether that determination was clearly erroneous.\"      Id.\n\n(citations omitted).    Factual findings are clearly erroneous \"'if\n\nthe findings are unsupported by substantial evidence, lack\n\nadequate evidentiary support in the record, are against the clear\n\nweight of the evidence or where the district court has\n\nmisapprehended the weight of the evidence.'\"      Id. (quoting Lame\n\nv. Department of Justice, 767 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir. 1985) (Lame\n\nII)).\n\n          The district court exercised jurisdiction in this\n\nmatter pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (1988) and 28 U.S.C.\n\n§1331 (1988).    Our jurisdiction in this appeal rests on 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291 (1988).\n\n\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act, 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552, in order \"to facilitate public access to Government\n\ndocuments.\"     United States Dep't of State v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164,\n173, 112 S. Ct. 541, 547 (1991).       Premised on the belief that \"an\n\ninformed electorate is vital to the proper operation of a\n\ndemocracy,\" FOIA was intended to create an expedient tool for\n\ndisseminating information and holding the government accountable.\n\nCoastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy, 644 F.2d 969,\n\n974 (3d Cir. 1981) (quoting S. Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st\n\nSess. 3 (1965)).    Consistent with this purpose, FOIA requires\n\n                                  10\n\fgovernmental agencies to make promptly available any records\n\nrequested unless the requested information is exempt from\n\ndisclosure under one of the nine specific exemptions set forth in\n\nthe FOIA statute itself.   5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (1988 & Supp. V\n\n1993).\n\n           The Act creates a strong presumption in favor of\n\ndisclosure, Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 361,\n\n96 S. Ct. 1595, 1599 (1976), and requires the district court to\n\nconduct a de novo review of a government agency's determination\n\nto withhold requested information.    5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).   The\n\nagency has the burden of showing that a statutory exemption\n\napplies.   Id.   Moreover, any reasonably segregable portion of a\n\nrecord must be made available to the person requesting the\n\nrecord.    5 U.S.C. § 552(b).\n\n            The review of FOIA cases \"is made difficult by the fact\n\nthat the party seeking disclosure does not know the contents of\n\nthe information sought and is, therefore, helpless to contradict\n\nthe government's description of the information or effectively\n\nassist the trial judge.\"   Ferri v. Bell, 645 F.2d 1213, 1222 (3d\n\nCir. 1981), modified, 671 F.2d 769 (3d Cir. 1992).    In order to\n\n\"transform a potentially ineffective, inquisitorial proceeding\n\nagainst an agency that controls information into a meaningful\n\nadversarial process,\" the reviewing court may order the\n\ngovernment to prepare a \"Vaughn\" index, identifying each document\n\nwithheld, the statutory exemption claimed, and a particularized\n\ndescription of how each document withheld falls within a\n\nstatutory exemption.   Coastal States, 644 F.2d at 984.   We have\n\n\n                                 11\n\fadopted the principles and procedures outlined in Vaughn.     See,\n\ne.g., Ferri, 645 F.2d at 1222 & n.11.\n\n          The function of a Vaughn index and public affidavit is\n\nto establish a detailed factual basis for application of the\n\nclaimed FOIA exemptions to each of the documents withheld.     In\n\nMcDonnell v. United States, 4 F.3d 1227 (3d Cir. 1993), we\n\nexplained:\n          The significance of agency affidavits in a\n          FOIA case cannot be underestimated . . . .\n          Affidavits submitted by a governmental agency\n          in justification for its exemption claims\n          must therefore strive to correct, however\n          imperfectly, the asymmetrical distribution of\n          knowledge that characterizes FOIA litigation.\n          The detailed public index which in Vaughn we\n          required of withholding agencies is intended\n          to do just that . . . . Thus, when an agency\n          seeks to withhold information, it must\n          provide \"a relatively detailed justification,\n          specifically identifying the reasons why a\n          particular exemption is relevant and\n          correlating those claims with the particular\n          part of a withheld document to which they\n          apply.\"\n\n\nId. at 1241 (quoting King, 830 F.2d at 218-19).\n\n          While there is no set formula for a Vaughn index, the\n\nhallmark test is \"that the requester and the trial judge be able\n\nto derive from the index a clear explanation of why each document\n\nor portion of a document withheld is putatively exempt from\n\ndisclosure.\"   Hinton v. Department of Justice, 844 F.2d 126, 129\n\n(3d Cir. 1988).   An agency is entitled to summary judgment when\n\nthe agency's affidavits:\n          describe the withheld information and the\n          justification for withholding with reasonable\n          specificity, demonstrating a logical\n          connection between the information and the\n\n\n                                12\n\f            claimed exemption . . ., and are not\n            controverted by either contrary evidence in\n            the record nor by evidence of agency bad\n            faith.\n\n\nAmerican Friends Serv. Comm. v. Department of Defense, 831 F.2d\n\n441, 444 (3d Cir. 1987) (quoting Abbotts v. Nuclear Regulatory\n\nComm., 766 F.2d 604, 606 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (internal quotations\n\nand citations omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                 A.\n\n            The fundamental inquiry in this case centers on whether\n\nthe \"categorical\" method of indexing utilized by the government\n\nconstitutes an adequate Vaughn index.    The government offered the\n\ndeclaration of Agent Moran as its Vaughn index.    The Moran\n\ndeclaration described the FBI's generalized FOIA procedures,\n\nincluding a summary of exemption \"justification categories.\"           It\n\nset forth a detailed explanation of the justification categories\n\nused to redact the material included in the declaration.        Each\n\njustification category was denoted by a three or four letter\n\ncode.   These codes appeared next to the redacted portions of the\n\nexhibits.    The government maintains that this declaration, in\n\nconjunction with Agent Moran's testimony, was a sufficiently\n\nadequate Vaughn index that permitted the district court to review\n\nall of the exemption claims advanced.\n\n            In its brief the government provided representative\n\nexamples of the categorical indexing method it used.      For\n\ninstance, the declaration explained that code \"b7D-3\" appearing\n\nnext to the first redacted paragraph means that the information\n\n\n                                 13\n\fwas withheld because it was provided to the FBI by a source who\n\nhad \"received an express promise that it would be held in\n\nconfidence\" and contained information that could lead to the\n\nsource's identity.    App. at 87.    The declaration further\n\nexplained that disclosure had the potential of causing \"great\n\nharm to the source,\" and of harming the FBI because of the\n\n\"chilling effect on the activities and cooperation of other\n\nsources.\"    App. at 88.   As a second example, the government\n\ndemonstrated that the list of names and addresses provided by the\n\nconfidential source were withheld under category \"b7C-6.\"        The\n\ndeclaration explained that this category means that the\n\ninformation was withheld to prevent an unwarranted invasion of\n\nprivacy of the individuals named, since disclosure could\n\n\"announce to the world that they were of investigative interest\n\nto the FBI and therefore permit derogatory inferences to be made\n\ntherefrom.\"    App. at 79.\n\n            The government asserts that the use of a coded index\n\nsystem sufficiently fulfills the functions served by the classic\n\nVaughn index, but in a more efficient and clear manner.        Davin\n\nargues that such a categorical approach, without the inclusion of\n\nspecific factual information that correlates the claimed\n\nexemptions to the withheld documents, is not a sufficient Vaughn\nindex.   We agree with Davin.\n\n            In McDonnell we held that in order for the FBI to\n\nfulfill its burden to establish that materials withheld are\n\nexempt from FOIA, \"[t]he agency may meet this burden by filing\n\naffidavits describing the material withheld and detailing why it\n\n                                    14\n\ffits within the claimed exemption.\"   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1241\n\n(emphasis added) (citing King, 830 F.2d at 217-18).    See also\n\nLame v. United States Dep't of Justice, 654 F.2d 917, 928 (3d\n\nCir. 1981) (Lame I) (the district court \"should have had an\n\nexplanation by the FBI of why in each case disclosure would\n\nresult in embarrassment or harassment either to the individual\n\ninterviewed or to third parties\" (emphasis added)).    This\n\nprecedent requires that the agency provide the \"connective\n\ntissue\" between the document, the deletion, the exemption and the\n\nexplanation.    It is insufficient for the agency to simply cite\n\ncategorical codes, and then provide a generic explanation of what\n\nthe codes signify.    See King, 830 F.2d at 223-34 (\"A withholding\n\nagency must describe each document or portion thereof withheld,\n\nand for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of\n\ndisclosing the sought-after information. . . . Categorical\n\ndescription of redacted material coupled with categorical\n\nindication of anticipated consequences of disclosure is clearly\n\ninadequate.\" (emphasis in original)(footnote omitted)).\n\n           In the case at hand, the government's references to\n\ncausing \"great harm to the source,\" App. at 88, and to the\n\npossibility that disclosure could \"announce to the world that\n\nthey were of investigative interest to the FBI and therefore\n\npermit derogatory inferences to be made therefrom,\" App. at 79,\n\nare generic explanations broad enough to apply to any FOIA\n\nrequest.   They are not tied to the content of the specific\n\nredactions.    The justification codes and the explanations offered\n\nby the government lack an explanation of how the release of the\n\n                                 15\n\finformation would violate the privacy interests and pose\n\npotential risk to certain individuals.   Moreover, throughout his\n\ntestimony, Agent Moran reiterated the broad categorical\n\nexplanations recited in his declaration; he did not refer to\n\nspecific facts.   Thus, Agent Moran's testimony sheds no new light\n\non the government's reasons for nondisclosure.\n\n          While the use of the categorical method does not per se\n\nrender a Vaughn index inadequate, an agency using justification\n\ncodes must also include specific factual information concerning\n\nthe documents withheld and correlate the claimed exemptions to\n\nthe withheld documents.   Compare Keys v. United States Dep't of\n\nJustice, 830 F.2d 337, 350 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (upholding use of\n\nindexing system where \"the affidavit placed each document into\n\nits historical and investigative context\") with King, 830 F.2d at\n\n221 (similar coding system found wanting \"because we are left\n\nwith no contextual description for documents or substantial\n\nportions of documents withheld in their entirety\") and Wiener v.\n\nFBI, 943 F.2d 972, 978-79 (9th Cir. 1991) (\"boilerplate\"\n\nexplanations of coded index found inadequate since \"[n]o effort\n\nis made to tailor the explanation to the specific document\n\nwithheld\"), cert. denied,     U.S.   , 112 S. Ct. 3013 (1992).   As\n\nthe Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit warned: \"the goal of\n\ndescriptive accuracy is not to be sacrificed to the niceties of a\n\nparticular classification scheme.\"   King, 830 F.2d at 225.    Thus,\n\n\"a coding system might be employed to indicate applicability of a\n\ngiven response to more than one segment of redacted material,\"\n\nbut only \"so long as the information supplied remains responsive\n\n                                16\n\fto each deleted segment without becoming categorical in tenor.\"\n\nId. at 224 (emphasis added).\n\n          The Vaughn index provided by the government affords\n\nDavin little or no meaningful opportunity to argue for release of\n\nparticular documents.   Indeed, the index provides no information\n\nabout particular documents that might be useful in evaluating the\n\npropriety of the decision to withhold.     Because of the paucity of\n\nfactual information related to the district court, the\n\ncategorical justification codes could not provide a sufficient\n\nfactual basis from which the district court could make its\n\ndetermination.   Accordingly, on the record before us, we hold\n\nthat the district court could not fulfill its duty of ruling on\n\nthe applicability of the claimed exemptions on the basis of the\n\ncoded indexing system utilized by the government for its Vaughn\n\nindex.\n\n\n\n                                 B.\n\n          Davin further contends that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to require the FBI to release all reasonably segregable\n\nportions of the sample documents.     Davin also maintains that the\n\nFBI is required under FOIA to provide him with all reasonably\n\nsegregable material of all the 10,000 pages of material, not just\nthe sampled material.   FOIA mandates that \"[a]ny reasonable\n\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person\n\nrequesting such record after deletion of the portions which are\n\nexempt under this subsection.\"   5 U.S.C. § 552(b).    In\n\ndetermining segregability, courts must construe the exemptions\n\n                                 17\n\fnarrowly with the emphasis on disclosure.    Wightman v. Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 755 F.2d 979, 982 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\nThe district court found that the FBI complied with its\n\nobligation.\n\n          It is the agency's burden to prove that the withheld\n\nportions are not segregable from the non-exempt material.      5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B).   In the case at bar, the only evidence\n\nsubmitted by the government in support of its position was Agent\n\nMoran's conclusory statement that \"[e]very effort has been made\n\nto provide the plaintiff with all reasonably segregable portions\n\non [sic] the sampled material.\"    App. at 67.   Nowhere in Moran's\n\ndeclaration did he describe the process by which he determined\n\nthat all reasonably segregable material of each of the withheld\n\ndocuments or portions of documents had been released.    Nor did\n\nthe government provide a factual recitation of why certain\n\nmaterials are not reasonably segregable.\n\n          In its brief the government points, as an example, to\n\nExhibits C-1 through C-7 which Agent Moran explained had been\n\nprovided by a source under the express promise of\n\nconfidentiality.   Government's Brief at 19-20.    According to the\n\ngovernment, these documents contained a narrative in which a\n\nnumber of individuals involved with the WAA were named.       Exhibit\n\nC-1 bore two coded references: \"b7C-6\" and \"b7D-3.\"     The\n\ngovernment explained that category b7C-6 refers to the names of\n\nindividuals who are of investigative interest to the FBI.\n\nAccording to Moran's declaration, the release of this information\n\nwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.    App. at 79-\n\n                                  18\n\f80.   Category b7D-3 indicates that the information was provided\n\nby an individual who had received an express promise of\n\nconfidentiality.   App. at 87.   The government notes that a\n\nportion of C-8 was released because the identity of the\n\nconfidential source could not be ascertained.\n\n          This representative example provided by the government\n\nitself, as an illustration of its proper efforts to provide Davin\n\nwith all reasonably segregable information, in fact reflects the\n\ninadequacy of the government's efforts.    The government fails to\n\nindicate why the privacy interests at stake could not be\n\nprotected simply by redacting particular identifying information.\n\nWithout some further elaboration of the document's contents,\n\nDavin is unable to dispute the FBI's assertion that more\n\ninformation is not segregable.   Cf. Church of Scientology Int'l\n\nv. United States Dep't of Justice, 30 F.3d 224, 232 n.11 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (the government \"needs to provide more than [an]\n\nunsupported conclusion to justify withholding the whole document.\n\nIs the document full of personal anecdotes, whose perspective\n\nwould tend to reveal the declarant, thus supporting this\n\nconclusion?   Or does the document simply give one individual's\n\ndescription of the way the Church generally treats members, and\n\nthus arguably include material that could be segregated from the\n\nidentifying information?\").\n\n          The Moran declaration is comprised of assertions that\n\ndocuments were withheld because they contain the type of\n\ninformation generally protected by a particular exemption.     The\n\nstatements regarding segregability are wholly conclusory,\n\n                                 19\n\fproviding no information that would enable Davin to evaluate the\n\nFBI's decisions to withhold.   On remand, the government must\n\nprovide an adequate factual basis for the district court to\n\ndetermine whether Davin has been afforded all reasonably\n\nsegregable information.2\n\n          Furthermore, the government must provide Davin with all\n\nreasonably segregable non-exempt information, not just the non-\n\nexempt information found in the sampled documents.    The\n\ngovernment maintains that it is only required to produce all\n\nreasonably segregable material from the sampled material.      It\n\nclaims that because Davin agreed to a representative sampling of\n\napproximately 500 pages of the 6,689 documents selected he\n\n\"should abide by his decision.\"    Government's Brief at 19.\n\n\n\n2\nIn addition to making findings without sufficient evidentiary\nsupport, the district court may have also erred in holding that\nmore information was not reasonably segregable. Although our\nscope of review on appeal is limited in this context, see\nMcDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1242, it appears that certain information\ncould be disclosed without jeopardizing possibly exempt\ninformation. We note the colloquy between Agent Moran and\ncounsel for Davin regarding the deletions of certain headings in\nthe table of contents of a 200 page report. Agent Moran\ntestified that the deletions did not contain the name of a\nconfidential source or confidential information, but rather the\nheadings were redacted \"because some of the information would\nindicate possibly a particular area of the country\" from where\nthe informant was operating and might, therefore, lead the\nrequester back to the identity of a particular confidential\nsource. App. at 618. We do not find it likely that a reference\nto a particular \"area of the country\" would lead to the identity\nof individuals who were given promises of confidentiality. On\nremand, if after receiving a sufficient factual basis the court\ndetermines that certain information is exempt from disclosure,\nthe district court should reexamine whether seemingly non-\nidentifying information such as this geographical information\nshould also be withheld.\n\n\n                                  20\n\f          The purpose of the Vaughn index is to help specify in a\n\nlarge document which portions of the document are disclosable and\n\nwhich are allegedly exempt.     Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 827\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1973) (Vaughn I), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 977, 94 S.\n\nCt. 1564 (1974).     The indexing system \"subdivide[s] the document\n\nunder consideration into manageable parts,\" so that once the\n\nissues are focused, the reviewing court will have an easier task\n\n\"rul[ing] on each element of the itemized list\" than it would if\n\nthe \"agency were permitted to make a generalized argument in\n\nfavor of exemption.\"    Id.\n\n          Courts have upheld the use of a representative sample,\n\nsuch as the sample stipulated to in this case.     See, e.g.,\n\nWeisberg v. United States Dep't of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1490\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1984); Vaughn v. Rosen, 523 F.2d 1136, 1140 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1975) (Vaughn II).    Nevertheless, any decision as to those\n\ndocuments is applicable to all of the documents at issue.       See\n\nVaughn II, 523 F.2d at 1140 (noting that parties stipulated that\n\nany decision regarding the representative sample is applicable to\n\nall of the documents).     Accordingly, on remand the district court\n\nshould reexamine the material in the sample, and any rulings it\n\nmakes regarding those materials must then be applied to the\n\nentire body of the requested information.     The government is then\n\nobligated to provide Davin all the reasonably segregable material\n\nof all the 10,000 pages requested, based upon the district\ncourt's ruling.\n\n          These two holdings regarding general deficiencies in\n\nthe government's Vaughn index alone require reversal of the\n\n                                  21\n\fdistrict court's order and remand for further fact finding.\n\nHowever, because on remand the district court may reach\n\ndeterminations of specific exemptions, we find it instructive to\n\nclarify certain contested issues and delineate the proper legal\n\nstandards for future resolution.\n\n\n\n                               IV.\n\n          For the majority of the withheld information, the\n\ngovernment has claimed exemptions under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7),\n\nwhich applies to records or information compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes.   Section 552(b)(7) provides, in relevant\n\npart, that the following is exempt from disclosure:\n          records or information compiled for law\n          enforcement purposes, but only to the extent\n          that the production of such law enforcement\n          records or information . . . (C) could\n          reasonably be expected to constitute an\n          unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D)\n          could reasonably be expected to disclose the\n          identity of a confidential source, . . .\n          which furnished information on a confidential\n          basis, and, in the case of a record or\n          information compiled by a criminal law\n          enforcement authority in the course of a\n          criminal investigation or by an agency\n          conducting a lawful national security\n          intelligence investigation, information\n          furnished by a confidential source, (E) would\n          disclose techniques and procedures for law\n          enforcement investigations or prosecutions .\n          . . if such disclosure could reasonably be\n          expected to risk circumvention of the law . .\n          . .\n\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7) (1988 & Supp. V 1993).   Thus, in order to\n\nprevail on an Exemption 7 claim, the government must bear its\n\nburden of demonstrating for every record that: (1) the\n\n\n                                22\n\finformation the FBI seeks to conceal was \"compiled for law\n\nenforcement purposes,\" and (2) disclosure would produce one of\n\nthe specified harms enumerated in the statute.    United States\n\nDep't of Justice v. Landano,    U.S.   ,   , 113 S. Ct. 2014,\n\n2019 (1993); Federal Bureau of Investigation v. Abramson, 456\n\nU.S. 615, 622, 102 S. Ct. 2054, 2059-60 (1982).\n\n\n\n                               A.\n\n          In reviewing the government's withholding of records\n\nunder any subsection of § 552(b)(7), the district court must\n\nfirst be satisfied that those materials qualify as \"records or\n\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes.\"3   There is\n\ndisagreement among the courts of appeals about how to make this\n\nthreshold determination.\n\n3\nWhile the focus of this case is upon documents compiled for\nputative criminal investigations, we note that \"records or\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes\" are not\nlimited to records or information compiled for criminal\ninvestigations. While criminal investigation is certainly one\nlaw enforcement purpose, there are also additional law\nenforcement purposes which are not necessarily criminal in\nnature. Indeed, the statute itself treats both \"criminal\ninvestigation[s]\" and \"national security intelligence\ninvestigation[s]\" as subsets of law enforcement records in\nExemption 7(D). Thus, other agencies that have some law\nenforcement duties, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission in investigating violations of Title VII, the Internal\nRevenue Service in enforcing the tax laws, and the National Labor\nRelations Board in conducting unfair labor practice proceedings,\nmay also justify withholding information under Exemption 7. Note,\nhowever, that an agency whose principal function is not law\nenforcement bears the burden of proving that \"the records it\nseeks to shelter under Exemption 7 were compiled for adjudicatory\nor enforcement purposes.\" Stern v. FBI, 737 F.2d 84, 88 (D.C.\nCir. 1984); see also infra at    [typescript at 26-28]\n(discussing Committee on Masonic Homes v. NLRB, 556 F.2d 214,\n218-19 (3d Cir. 1977)).\n\n\n                               23\n\f             The government suggests that we follow the courts who\n\nhave adopted a per se rule, under which all records compiled by\n\nlaw enforcement agencies such as the FBI qualify as \"records\n\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes\" pursuant to the (b)(7)\n\nexception.    See Jones v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 41 F.3d\n\n238, 245-46 (6th Cir. 1994) (determining that the per se rule\n\ncomports more fully with the policies Congress enacted in FOIA);\n\nFerguson v. FBI, 957 F.2d 1059, 1070 (2d Cir. 1992) (district\n\ncourt should not engage in factual inquiry as to legitimacy of\n\nlaw enforcement purpose); Curran v. Department of Justice, 813\n\nF.2d 473, 475 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[T]he investigatory records of\n\nlaw enforcement agencies are inherently records compiled for 'law\n\nenforcement purposes' within the meaning of Exemption 7.\"\n\n(citation omitted)); Kuehnert v. FBI, 620 F.2d 662, 666 (8th Cir.\n\n1980) (a showing of law enforcement purpose of a particular\n\ninvestigation is not a precondition to FBI's invocation of\n\nExemption 7).\n\n             In contrast, the Court of Appeals for the District of\n\nColumbia Circuit has rejected a per se rule, and adopted a two-\n\npart test that must be satisfied in order for a law enforcement\n\nagency to pass the Exemption 7 threshold.     See Pratt v. Webster,\n673 F.2d 408 (D.C. Cir. 1982).    In Pratt, the court described the\n\ntwo \"critical conditions\" of what has been named the \"rational\n\nnexus\" rule:\n          First, the agency's investigatory activities\n          that give rise to the documents sought must\n          be related to the enforcement of federal laws\n          or to the maintenance of national security.\n          To satisfy this requirement of a \"nexus,\" the\n\n\n                                  24\n\f          agency should be able to identify a\n          particular individual or a particular\n          incident as the object of its investigation\n          and the connection between that individual or\n          incident and a possible security risk or\n          violation of federal law. The possible\n          violation or security risk is necessary to\n          establish that the agency acted within its\n          principal function of law enforcement, rather\n          than merely engaging in a general monitoring\n          of private individuals' activities. . . .\n\n               Second, the nexus between the\n          investigation and one of the agency's law\n          enforcement duties must be based on\n          information sufficient to support at least \"a\n          colorable claim\" of its rationality. . . .\n          Such an agency, in order to carry out its\n          functions, often must act upon unverified\n          tips and suspicions based upon mere tidbits\n          of information. A court, therefore, should\n          be hesitant to second-guess a law enforcement\n          agency's decision to investigate if there is\n          a plausible basis for its decision. Nor is\n          it necessary for the investigation to lead to\n          a criminal prosecution or other enforcement\n          proceeding in order to satisfy the \"law\n          enforcement purpose\" criterion. . . .\n\n               Thus, . . . [i]n order to pass the FOIA\n          Exemption 7 threshold, such an agency must\n          establish that its investigatory activities\n          are realistically based on a legitimate\n          concern that federal laws have been or may be\n          violated or that national security may be\n          breached. Either of these concerns must have\n          some plausible basis and have a rational\n          connection to the object of the agency's\n          investigation.\n\n\nPratt, 673 F.2d at 420-21 (emphasis in the original) (citations\n\nand footnotes omitted).   See also King, 830 F.2d at 229 (FBI\n\nrecords are not deemed law enforcement records simply by virtue\n\nof the function that the FBI serves, but rather the two-prong\n\nPratt test must be applied to determine the threshold showing\n\n\n\n                                25\n\frequisite).   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also\n\nadopted a \"rational nexus\" standard.     See, e.g., Wiener, 943 F.2d\n\nat 985 (\"No withholding under any of the exemptions listed in\n\nsection 552(b)(7) is valid unless the withholding agency\n\nestablishes a '\"rational nexus\" between its law enforcement\n\nduties and the document for which Exemption 7 is claimed.'\"\n\n(citations omitted)).\n\n          We have not directly ruled on what must be established\n\nin order to meet the threshold requirement.    We find, however,\n\nsome guidance from our prior precedents.    In Committee on Masonic\n\nHomes v. NLRB, 556 F.2d 214 (3d Cir. 1977), an employer had\n\nrequested from the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") all\n\nunion authorization cards that had been submitted by the union as\n\nevidence of support.    The NLRB claimed that the cards were exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under Exemption 7.     The NLRB argued that it had\n\nan enforcement purpose -- enforcing the National Labor Relations\n\nAct -- for which the union authorization cards under question\n\nwere compiled.   We held that under the circumstances of that\n\ncase, there was no \"law enforcement purpose\" pursuant to\n\nExemption 7, because \"'law enforcement purposes' must relate to\n\nsome type of formal proceedings, and one that is pending.\" Id. at\n219; see also Ferri, 645 F.2d at 1223 (\"[T]he 'investigatory\n\nrecords' exemption is to be construed literally.    It contemplates\n\nfiles compiled with a specific, formal proceeding or\n\ninvestigation in mind.\").\n\n          The precedential force of Masonic Homes can be\nquestioned for two reasons.   First, we decided Masonic Homes\n\n\n                                 26\n\fprior to the 1986 Amendment to FOIA that replaced the language\n\n\"investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\"\n\nwith the present language of § 552(b)(7), \"records or information\n\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes.\"   This amended language\n\ncan appear to have been intended to broaden the exemption's\n\nreach.   We learn from the legislative history, however, that\n\nCongress' action was not intended to modify the threshold showing\n\nof law-enforcement purpose.   The report of the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee on S. 774, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), stated that\n\nthe amendment \"does not affect the threshold question of whether\n\n'records or information' withheld under (b)(7) were 'compiled for\n\nlaw enforcement purposes.'    This standard would still have to be\n\nsatisfied in order to claim the protection of the (b)(7)\n\nexemption.\"   S. Rep. No. 221, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1983),\n\nreprinted in relevant part in, 132 Cong. Rec. H9466 (daily ed.\n\nOct. 8, 1986); see King, 830 F.2d at 229 n.141 (providing\n\ndetailed legislative history of the 1986 Amendment to Exemption\n\n7).   Accordingly, we can be assured that our holding in Masonic\n\nHomes has not been undercut by legislative fiat.\n\n           Second, because the withholding agency in Masonic Homes\nwas the NLRB, it is unclear whether our conclusion that \"law\n\nenforcement purposes\" must relate to some type of formal\n\nenforcement proceeding, has an application to an agency whose\n\nprincipal function is criminal law enforcement.    See Pratt, 673\n\nF.2d at 421 n.33 (\"We believe that the Third Circuit's conclusion\n\nthat '\"law enforcement purposes\" must relate to some type of\n\nenforcement proceeding, and one that is pending,' has no\n\n                                 27\n\fapplication to an agency whose principal function is criminal law\n\nenforcement.   Therefore, we also dismiss the First Circuit's\n\nconcern . . . that the need to shield legitimate law enforcement\n\nefforts from harmful FOIA disclosures might lead to frivolous\n\nprosecutions.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n           While we are not bound to extend our holding in Masonic\n\nHomes to a law enforcement agency such as the FBI, at minimum,\n\nour statements in Masonic Homes indicate a rejection of a per se\n\nrule.   Accordingly, we must devise a test to apply to law\n\nenforcement agencies that requires the agency to sustain its\n\nburden of establishing the threshold element of Exemption 7.\n\n           We believe the preferable test is an adaptation of the\n\ntwo-prong \"rational nexus\" test articulated by the Court of\n\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Pratt.   Under\n\nthis test, the government must identify a particular individual\n\nor incident as the object of the investigation and specify the\n\nconnection of the individual or incident to a potential violation\n\nof law or security risk.   The agency must then demonstrate that\n\nthis relationship is based upon information \"sufficient to\n\nsupport at least a 'colorable claim' of its rationality.\"      Pratt,\n673 F.2d at 421.\n\n           The D.C. Circuit has explained that the threshold\n\nshowing required by Pratt is an \"objective\" one, and \"suffices to\n\nestablish the exemption only if it is unrefuted by persuasive\n\nevidence that in fact another, nonqualifying reason prompted the\n\ninvestigation,\" such as where an investigation is conducted \"for\n\n\n\n                                28\n\fpurposes of harassment.\"   Shaw v. FBI, 749 F.2d 58, 63-64 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1984).\n\n           In the present case, the FBI submitted a description of\n\nthe nine files pertaining to Davin's FOIA request in the Moran\n\ndeclaration, as quoted above.    See supra at   [typescript at 3-\n\n5].   The declaration clearly identifies David Lasser and the WAA\n\nas the targets of the investigations, thereby fulfilling the\n\nfirst prong of the Pratt test.    The declaration, however, plainly\n\nfailed to specify the connection between Lasser and the WAA, and\n\nthe possible security risk or violation of federal law.\n\n           As a preliminary matter, the declaration only contained\n\na general description of the files and did not describe the nexus\n\nbetween each document and a particular investigation.   Indeed,\n\nthe government failed even to identify the investigations to\n\nwhich each document in the nine FBI files pertained.\n\n           Furthermore, the declaration does little more than cite\n\nto the criminal statutes, executive orders, and public laws\n\npursuant to which the investigations were undertaken, \"presumably\n\nindicating that somewhere within the parameters of these general\n\nprovisions were criminal acts that the FBI suspected [Lasser and\n\nthe WAA] of committing.\"   King, 830 F.2d at 230.   While the\n\nsecond prong inquiry is \"necessarily deferential\" to the agency,\n\nPratt, 673 F.2d at 421, we believe that the simple recitation of\n\nstatutes, orders and public laws is an insufficient showing of a\n\nrational nexus to a legitimate law enforcement concern.   The FBI\n\nhas failed to meet its burden in the district court because\n\nneither Agent Moran's declaration nor his testimony provide any\n\n                                 29\n\fdetail concerning the supposed law enforcement activities that\n\ngenerated each of the documents in the Vaughn index.      The FBI\n\nmust come forward with additional evidence to support its claim\n\nof a law enforcement purpose.\n\n            In addition, we note that even the skeletal\n\ndescriptions of the files provided by Agent Moran cast doubt on\n\nthe government's assertion that the files were related to a law\n\nenforcement purpose: while the nine files cover investigations\n\nspanning over forty years, the government has not pointed to a\n\nsingle arrest, indictment or conviction.\n\n            We acknowledge that the Supreme Court has indicated\n\nthere is no requirement for the compilation of information to be\n\neffected by a specific time.    See John Doe Agency v. John Doe\n\nCorp., 493 U.S. 146, 153, 110 S. Ct. 471, 476 (1989).     Nor do we\n\nrequire evidence of an actual indictment or conviction in order\n\nfor the government to fulfill its burden of proving that its\n\ninvestigation pertained to a law enforcement purpose.     However,\n\non the record before us, the government must allege additional\n\nspecific facts that demonstrate \"the agency was gathering\n\ninformation with the good faith belief that the subject may\n\nviolate or has violated federal law,\" and was not \"merely\n\nmonitoring the subject for purposes unrelated to enforcement of\n\nthe law.\"   Lamont v. Department of Justice, 475 F. Supp. 761, 773\n(S.D.N.Y. 1979) (citing, inter alia, Masonic Homes, 556 F.2d at\n\n219).   If the government's investigation did not ultimately\n\nresult in any arrests, indictments or other proceedings, then the\n\ngovernment may sustain its burden under § 552(b)(7) by explaining\n\n                                 30\n\fwhy it decided not to follow through with the investigations. The\n\nVaughn index in this case, however, provides Davin with no\n\ninformation whatsoever about the initiation, breadth or results\n\nof the investigations.   The paucity of information about these\n\nlengthy investigations casts doubt on the government's assertion\n\nthat withheld documents pertain to law enforcement\n\ninvestigations, and has made impossible Davin's challenge to the\n\ngovernment's claim.\n\n          The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was faced\n\nwith similar circumstances in Wiener, where the FBI refused to\n\nrelease files to a historian concerning political investigations\n\nof John Lennon.   In that case, the FBI claimed Exemption 7,\n\nalleging that:\n          John Lennon was under investigation for\n          possible violations of the Civil Disobedience\n          Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. § 231 (1988), and the\n          Anti-Riot Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2101 (1988),\n          because of his association with a radical\n          group known as the Election Year Strategy\n          Information Center (EYSIC).\n\n\nWiener, 943 F.2d at 985-96.   The court rejected the FBI's claims,\n\nholding that:\n          The Civil Disobedience Act and the Anti-Riot\n          Act are very broad criminal statutes,\n          prohibiting a wide variety of conduct.\n          Citations to these statues do little to\n          inform Wiener of the claimed law enforcement\n          purpose underlying the investigation of John\n          Lennon. Without providing Wiener with\n          further details of the kinds of criminal\n          activity of which John Lennon was allegedly\n          suspected, Wiener cannot effectively argue\n          that the claimed law enforcement purpose was\n          in effect a pretext.\n\n\n\n\n                                31\n\fId. at 986.\n\n            The statutes that criminalize treason, misprision of\n\ntreason, recruiting for service against the United States, and\n\nthe other criminal activities that the FBI was \"investigating\"\n\nare no less broad than the Civil Disobedience Act or the Anti-\n\nRiot Act.    The FBI's blanket references to these statutes do not\n\nadequately inform Davin of the claimed law enforcement purposes\n\nof the FBI investigation of the WAA and Lasser.     Accordingly, on\n\nremand, the government must provide additional facts regarding\n\nthe law enforcement investigations implicated by each of the\n\ndocuments withheld under any (b)(7) exemption.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\n            If, on remand, the district court concludes that the\n\ngovernment has demonstrated a rational nexus between its law\n\nenforcement duties and the particular document or portions\n\nwithheld, then the district court will reach the specific\n\nexemptions of subsections of § 552(b)(7).      The government asserts\n\nthat information was exempt from disclosure under subsection\n\n(7)(C) Unwarranted Invasion of Personal Privacy, (7)(D)\n\nConfidential Source Material, and (7)(E) Investigative Techniques\n\nand Procedures.    We will address each exemption seriatim.\n\n\n\n                         1.   § 552(b)(7)(C)\n\n            Exemption 7(C) permits withholding of records or\n\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent\n\nthat production \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an\n\n                                  32\n\funwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"   5 U.S.C.\n\n§552(b)(7)(C).   Agent Moran identified nine privacy interests\n\nthat implicated Exemption 7(C): (1) the identities or identifiers\n\nof FBI personnel; (2) the names and identifying data of financial\n\ninstitution or commercial enterprise employees; (3) identities of\n\nnon-FBI federal government employees; (4) names and identifying\n\ndata of non-federal government law enforcement officers; (5)\n\nnames and identifying data of state and local government\n\nemployees; (6) names and identifying data pertaining to third\n\nparties who were of investigative interest; (7) names and\n\nidentifying data for third parties who were merely mentioned; (8)\n\nfile numbers related to third parties; and (9) names and\n\nidentifying information of individuals who provided information\n\nto the FBI.\n\n          We set forth the standards for evaluating a 7(C) claim\n\nin Lame I, where we held:\n          The Section 7(C) privacy exemption does not\n          prohibit all disclosures which invade\n          personal privacy, but only disclosures which\n          entail an unwarranted invasion of personal\n          privacy . . . . \"Exemption 7(C)'s protection\n          of personal privacy is not absolute . . . .\n          [T]he proper approach to [a] request under a\n          privacy based exemption such as 7(C) is a de\n          novo balancing test, weighing the privacy\n          interest and the extent to which it is\n          invaded on the one hand, against the public\n          benefit that would result from disclosure, on\n          the other.\"\n\n\nLame I, 654 F.2d at 922-23 (quoting Ferri, 645 F.2d at 1217). See\n\nalso McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1254.\n\n\n\n\n                                  33\n\f                             a. Privacy Interests\n\n            In United States Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm.\n\nfor Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 109 S. Ct. 1468 (1989),\n\nthe Supreme Court provided guidance on the proper understanding\n\nof \"privacy interest.\"        Quoting from Webster's dictionary, the\n\nCourt stated that information may be classified as \"private\" if\n\nit is \"intended for or restricted to the use of a particular\n\nperson or group or class of persons: not freely available to the\n\npublic.\"    Id. at 763-64, 109 S. Ct. at 1477 (footnote omitted).\n\nWe recognized in Landano v. United States Dep't of Justice, 956\n\nF.2d 422, 426 (3d Cir. 1992), vacated in part on other grounds\n\nand remanded,         U.S.    , 113 S. Ct. 2014 (1993), \"that\n\nindividuals involved in a criminal investigation -- including\n\nsuspects, witnesses, interviewees, and investigators -- possess\n\nprivacy interests, cognizable under Exemption 7(C), in not having\n\ntheir names revealed in connection with disclosure of the fact\n\nand subject matter of the investigation.\"           Id. at 426 (citation\n\nomitted).     Suspects, interviewees and witnesses have a privacy\n\ninterest because disclosure may result in embarrassment or\n\nharassment.     Id.    Law enforcement personnel involved in a\n\ncriminal investigation also have a cognizable privacy interest\n\nunder FOIA.     Id. (citing Patterson, 893 F.2d at 601).\n\n            Accordingly, the individuals involved in the\n\ninvestigations of David Lasser and the WAA have a privacy\n\ninterest in not having their identities disclosed.4          We note that\n\n4\nWe note again the colloquy between Agent Moran and counsel for\nDavin, in which Agent Moran concedes that certain information was\n\n                                      34\n\ffor some, the privacy interest may become diluted by the passage\n\nof time, though under certain circumstances the potential for\n\nembarrassment and harassment may also endure.   Id. at 427.     Thus,\n\nwhen balancing the private and public interests, the district\n\ncourt must determine the relative strength of an individual's\n\nprivacy interest.\n\n          The government and Davin dispute whether death\n\nextinguishes an individual's privacy rights under FOIA, and if\n\nso, whether the government is required to determine if the\n\nindividual is still alive.    The first issue has been settled by\n\nour holding in McDonnell, where we expressly announced that under\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(C), \"[p]ersons who are deceased have no privacy\n\ninterest in nondisclosure of their identities.\"    McDonnell, 4\n\nF.3d at 1257.   Furthermore, with regard to a claimed privacy\n\nexemption under § 552(b)(6), the exemption from disclosure of\n\npersonnel and medical files, we directed the government to\n\ndetermine whether the subject of a FOIA request was deceased or\n\nliving.   Id. at 1254.   While we recognize that the standard for\n\nevaluating privacy interests pursuant to Exemption 7(C) is\n\nsomewhat broader that the standard for Exemption 6, see Reporters\nCommittee, 489 U.S. at 756, 109 S. Ct. at 1473, we nonetheless do\n\n\nredacted pursuant to Exemption 7(C) \"[b]ecause some of the\ninformation would indicate possibly a particular area of the\ncountry\" from where an informant was operating, which might lead\nthe requester to the informant's identity. App. at 618. See\nsupra note 2. While the FBI may assert individuals' privacy\ninterest in not having their identities disclosed, the privacy\ninterest only extends to the individuals' names and street\naddresses, which need not be revealed, but not to cities,\noccupations, or other \"identifiers.\"\n\n\n                                 35\n\fnot perceive legitimate grounds for distinguishing between (b)(6)\n\nand (b)(7)(C) on this issue.\n\n           The government voices a concern, however, that to\n\nrequire the FBI to determine whether all of the hundreds of\n\nindividuals who are named in the files requested by Davin are\n\nalive \"would place a great, if not intolerable burden, on the\n\nFBI.\"   Government Brief at 33.   We are mindful that the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized a congressional intent \"to provide\n\n'\"workable\" rules' of FOIA disclosure.\"   Landano,     U.S. at      ,\n\n113 S. Ct. at 2023 (citations omitted).   Accordingly, we hold\n\nthat it is within the discretion of the district court to require\n\nan agency to demonstrate that the individuals upon whose behalf\n\nit claims the privacy exemption are, in fact, alive.     In\n\nexercising its discretion, the district court should consider\n\nsuch factors as the number of named individuals that must be\n\ninvestigated, and the age of the requested records.     If the\n\nnumber of individuals is not excessive, the agency could be\n\nrequired to determine whether the individuals are alive before\n\nasserting a privacy interest on their behalf.   However, after a\n\nsufficient passage of time -- such as in our case where the\n\npertinent investigations began over sixty years ago (and in\n\nMcDonnell where the investigation began over seventy years before\nthe FOIA request) -- the probability of the named individuals\n\nremaining alive diminishes.    Under such circumstances, it would\n\nbe unreasonable for the district court not to assume that many of\n\nthe individuals named in the requested records have died, thereby\n\nnegating a privacy interest unless proving otherwise.\n\n                                  36\n\f                         b. Public Benefit\n\n          The Reporters Committee decision also guides us in\n\nidentifying the relevant \"public benefits\" to be weighed against\n\nthe asserted privacy interests. The Supreme Court declared that:\n          whether disclosure of a private document\n          under Exemption 7(C) is warranted must turn\n          on the nature of the requested document and\n          its relationship to \"the basic purpose of the\n          Freedom of Information Act 'to open agency\n          action to the light of public scrutiny'\"\n          Department of Air Force v.

Ct.\n\nat 1481 (quoting EPA v. Mink, 410 U.S. 73, 80, 93 S. Ct. 827, 832\n\n(1973) (emphasis in original) (Douglas, J. dissenting)).    The\n\n\n\n                                 37\n\fdistrict court must determine, however, whether that purpose is\n\nfostered by disclosure of the identities of private citizens.\n\n          We are cognizant of the government's stated\n\njustification for withholding: (1) names and identifying data of\n\nnon-federal law enforcement officers because \"disclosure of their\n\nidentities would inhibit the cooperation and exchange of\n\ninformation between law enforcement officials and the FBI, and\n\nwould suppress a vital source of information that the FBI relies\n\nupon in order to pursue investigative interests against alleged\n\ncriminals, suspects or subjects of investigations,\" App. at 78;\n\nand (2) identities of third parties who furnished information to\n\nthe FBI because disclosure \"would seriously impede the FBI's\n\nability to gather future information.\"    App. at 81.   We held in\n\nMcDonnell that \"the Government's asserted interest in assuring\n\nfuture cooperation of witnesses with FBI investigations is not a\n\nvalid reason for refusing to disclose information under Exemption\n\n7(C).\"   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1256.   Accordingly, neither the FBI\n\nnor the district court may consider this factor in considering\n\nthe public benefit of withholding the information.\n\n\n\n            c. Balancing Private and Public Interests\n\n          Davin and the government disagree over how to perform\nthe balancing between private and public interests.     Davin refers\n\nus to our decision in Lame I, where we emphasized that \"[t]here\n\ncan be no question that the 7(C) balancing test must be conducted\n\nwith regard to each document, because the privacy interest and\n\nthe interest of the public in disclosure may vary from document\n\n                                38\n\fto document.   Indeed, these interests may vary from portion to\n\nportion of an individual document.\"   Lame I, 654 F.2d at 923\n\n(footnote omitted).    In that case, we concluded that the FBI's\n\nrefusal to disclose most of the witness interview transcripts\n\ncould not be justified under Exemption 7(C), without explaining\n\nwhy the interviews would result in embarrassment or harassment\n\neither to the individuals interviewed or to third parties.      Id.\n\nat 928.\n\n           The government, in contrast, notes that the Supreme\n\nCourt in Reporters Committee permitted agencies to exempt certain\n\nrecords categorically, as opposed to on a document-by-document\n\nbasis.    In Reporters Committee, the Court stated that\n\n\"categorical decisions may be appropriate and individual\n\ncircumstances disregarded when a case fits into a genus in which\n\nthe balance characteristically tips in one direction,\" 489 U.S.\n\nat 776, 109 S. Ct. at 1483, and concluded that \"rap sheet\"\n\ninformation is categorically exempt under § 522(b)(7)(C) because\n\nthe release of such information always constitutes an unwarranted\n\ninvasion of privacy.   Id. at 780, 109 S. Ct. at 1485.\n\n           While we believe that in the usual circumstance, an\n\nindividual's privacy interest in not having his or her identity\n\nrevealed in the context of a criminal or national security\n\ninvestigation overrides the public benefit, we will refrain from\n\nextending Reporters Committee to require a per se rule.    We\n\nsimilarly did not apply the categorical balancing approach in\n\nLandano, when we determined that FBI informants and agents had a\nprivacy interest in not having their names disclosed in\n\n\n                                 39\n\fconnection with a criminal investigation, which outweighed the\n\nasserted public interest (not recognized by FOIA) in discovering\n\nwrongdoing by a state agency.   Landano, 956 F.2d at 430-31.\n\n          Accordingly, while we do not comment on the proper\n\nresult of the balancing in this matter, we find it important to\n\nnote that the government must conduct a document by document\n\nfact-specific balancing.   Agent Moran dispatched all of the 7(C)\n\nexemptions claimed in the 9,270 pages withheld by stating that in\n\neach instance where information was withheld:\n          it was determined that individual privacy\n          interests were not outweighed by any public\n          interest. When the documents at issue were\n          reviewed . . . the passage of time and any\n          effect on the third party privacy interests\n          were considered. It was determined that the\n          privacy interests are stronger now than they\n          were when the records were created. To\n          reveal names in the context of these records\n          could reasonably be expected, due to the type\n          of the investigation to put the lives of\n          individuals in danger, cause embarrassment\n          and humiliation, and would therefore, be an\n          unwarranted invasion of privacy. The\n          disclosure of this information would not\n          contribute significantly to the public's\n          understanding of the operations or activities\n          of the Government.\n\n\nApp. at 75.   This explanation stands in stark contrast to\n\nMcDonnell, where \"[t]he Government set forth in an affidavit\n\nspecific reasons why these persons have a privacy interest in\n\nnondisclosure of their identities.\"   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1255.\n\nAgent Moran's affidavit and testimony, and consequently, the\n\ndistrict court's findings, did not link the (b)(7)(C) exemption\n\nto any of the individual documents.   On remand, the government\n\n\n\n                                40\n\fmust provide the district court with a more detailed balancing\n\neffort.\n\n\n\n                           2. § 552(b)(7)(D)\n\n           Exemption 7(D) excepts from disclosure records or\n\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to\n\nthe extent that the production:\n          could reasonably be expected to disclose the\n          identity of a confidential source, . . .\n          which furnished information on a confidential\n          basis, and, in the case of a record or\n          information compiled by criminal law\n          enforcement authority in the course of a\n          criminal investigation or by an agency\n          conducting a lawful national security\n          intelligence investigation, information\n          furnished by a confidential source.\n\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D).    See also McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1257.\n\n           The Supreme Court recently set forth the standards for\n\nwithholding a document under Exemption 7(D) in Landano.      The\n\nSupreme Court explained that a source is considered a\n\n\"confidential source\" only \"if the source `provided information\n\nunder an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances\n\nfrom which such an assurance could reasonably be inferred.'\"\n\nLandano,    U.S. at   , 113 S. Ct. at 2019-20 (quoting H.R. Conf.\n\nRep. No. 1200, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1974), reprinted in 1974\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 6285, 6291.\n\n           The government asserts that eight categories of\n\ninformation pertinent to Davin's request fall under Exemption\n\n7(D): (1) internal source symbols and code names assigned to\n\nconfidential informants; (2) internal symbol numbers which\n\n\n                                  41\n\fpertained to informants; (3) information provided by sources\n\nunder an express promise of confidentiality; (4) temporary source\n\nsymbols; (5) names and identifying data of third parties who\n\nprovided information and were interviewed under an implied\n\npromise of confidentiality; (6) information supplied by\n\ninstitutions under an implied promise of confidentiality; (7)\n\nidentities of non-federal law enforcement officers who provided\n\ninformation under an implied promise of confidentiality; and (8)\n\ninformation provided by local or state bureaus or agencies under\n\nan implied promise of confidentiality.\n\n           In Landano, the Supreme Court reemphasized that the\n\ngovernment bears the burden of establishing that Exemption 7(D)\n\napplies.   Landano,   U.S. at   , 113 S. Ct. at 2019.   The Court\n\nembarked on its discussion of implied assurances of\n\nconfidentiality after noting that the FBI in that case could not\n\nattempt to demonstrate that it made explicit promises of\n\nconfidentiality, because \"[t]hat sort of proof apparently often\n\nis not possible: The FBI does not have a policy of discussing\n\nconfidentiality with every source, and when such discussions do\n\noccur, agents do not always document them.\"    Id. at   , 113 S.\n\nCt. at 2020.   We glean from these remarks that if an agency\n\nattempts to withhold information under Exemption 7(D) by express\n\nassurances of confidentiality, the agency is required to come\n\nforward with probative evidence that the source did in fact\n\nreceive an express grant of confidentiality.   Proof could take\n\nthe form of declarations from the agents who extended the express\n\ngrants of confidentiality, contemporaneous documents from the FBI\n\n                                42\n\ffiles reflecting the express grants of confidentiality, evidence\n\nof a consistent policy of expressly granting confidentiality to\n\ncertain designated sources during the relevant time period, or\n\nother such evidence that comports with the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence.\n\n            Rather than provide such proof, the government submits\n\nAgent Moran's declaration that asserts an alleged policy of the\n\nFBI to grant express assurances of confidentiality on a routine\n\nbasis.5   The declaration fails to cite any written policy or\n\n5\nAgent Moran stated in his declaration:\n\n            Exemption (b)(7)(D) was asserted to withhold\n            information received from a source under an\n            express promise that it would be held in\n            confidence, as well as information that could\n            lead to the source's identity. These sources\n            are symbol numbered sources, code name\n            sources, or individuals who specifically\n            requested confidentiality . . . .\n            As a matter of policy and practice, all\n            symbol numbered informants or code names\n            sources are given express assurances of\n            confidentiality. Illustrative of this\n            express assurance of confidentiality is the\n            manner in which such information is treated\n            within the FBI. The identities of such\n            sources are not referred to by the true name\n            in any FBI document which records the\n            information they furnished. The identities\n            of these sources are known to very few FBI\n            employees and are available only on a \"need\n            to know\" basis. These special precautions\n            are needed because of the sensitive nature of\n            the information being provided and harm that\n            may befall these sources if their identities\n            were revealed. The manner in which the FBI\n            actually obtains information from these\n            sources is also demonstrative of the express\n            assurance of confidentiality under which it\n            is received. The information is received\n            only under conditions which guarantee the\n\n\n                                 43\n\fprovide any assurance that the alleged policy has been applied\n\nconsistently over the years, and in this specific case.     There is\n\nno proof that these particular sources received express grants of\n\nconfidentiality.\n\n          The government argues that we indicated in McDonnell\n\nthat courts may rely upon agency declarations in determining\n\nwhether a source has received an express assurance of\n\nconfidentiality.   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1258.   In that case, we\n\nheld that the district court did not err in adopting the\n\nmagistrate judge's conclusion that the identity of and\n\ninformation provided by two specific sources were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under (b)(7)(D) when the declaration stated one source\n\nwas given express assurance of confidentiality and the other\n\nsource was assigned a symbol source number and was never referred\n\nto by name in the file.   Id.   The government also cites Wiener,\n\n943 F.2d at 986, where the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n\nheld that the FBI \"need only establish the informant was told his\n\nname would be held in confidence.\"\n\n          These holdings do not support the government's\n\nassertion that it has sufficiently established that sources\n\nreceived express grants of confidentiality.     In McDonnell, the\nagent provided information regarding the circumstances\n\n\n          contact will not be jeopardized. Derivative\n          ensuing investigations attributable to a\n          symbol numbered source have also been denied\n          as disclosure of such would reveal the\n          identity of the source.\n\nApp. at 87-88.\n\n\n                                 44\n\fsurrounding the interviews in which express grants of\n\nconfidentiality were given to the two specific sources in\n\nquestion.   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1257-58.6   No such specifics are\n\nprovided in the Moran declaration in this case.    Furthermore,\n\nwhile the Wiener court required the FBI to \"establish the\n\ninformant was told his name would be held in confidence,\" the FBI\n\nhas failed to do so in this case since the government did not\n\npresent any evidence of its alleged policy or any evidence that\n\nan express grant of confidentiality was in fact given to any\n\nparticular source.\n\n            On remand, the government, if it pursues an exception\n\nfor express promises of confidentiality, must produce evidence of\n\n6\nIn McDonnell, we held that the district court did not err in\nadopting the magistrate judge's conclusion that the identity of a\ncertain source was exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(D),\nwhen, based on Agent Llewellyn's declaration, the magistrate\njudge \"determined that the Government gave an express assurance\nof confidentiality to an informant named in the files . . . . The\nidentity of this source was considered so sensitive that he or\nshe was assigned a symbol source number and was never referred to\nby name in the file.\" McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1258. While these\nstatements may appear to imply that the FBI only pointed to its\nsymbol source number policy to show that the sources received\nexpress grants of confidentiality, it is clear from reading\nMcDonnell that the agent's declaration in fact provided detailed\ninformation regarding the circumstances of the express grants of\nconfidentiality to the two specific sources involved in the\ninvestigation. We wrote: \"At oral argument on the parties'\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the magistrate judge ordered\nthe FBI to submit a declaration regarding the circumstances\nsurrounding the interviews of third parties who were members of\nthe public. This order was in response to two letters McDonnell\nhas submitted from interviewees stating that they had not\nreceived either express or implied assurances of confidentiality\nwhen the FBI interviewed them.\" Id. at 1257 (emphasis added). In\nresponse to this directive, the FBI submitted Agent Llewellyn's\ndeclaration, which presumably, fulfilled the magistrate judge's\norder.\n\n\n                                 45\n\fits alleged policy and practice of giving all symbol numbered\n\ninformants or code name sources express assurances of\n\nconfidentiality, evidence that the policy was in force throughout\n\nthe forty years spanned by the documents at issue, and evidence\n\nthat the policy was applied to each of the separate\n\ninvestigations and in each case in which a document or portion\n\nhas been withheld.\n\n           In addition to claiming that sources were given express\n\npromises of confidentiality, the government also asserts that\n\nsome sources gave the FBI information under \"an implied promise\n\nof confidentiality.\"    App. at 89.   In Landano, the Supreme Court\n\nexplained that:\n          the Government is not entitled to a\n          presumption that a source is confidential\n          within the meaning of Exemption 7(D) whenever\n          the source provides information to the FBI in\n          the course of a criminal investigation.\n\n                More narrowly defined circumstances\n           however, can provide a basis for inferring\n           confidentiality. For example, when\n           circumstances such as the nature of the crime\n           investigated and the witness' relation to it\n           support an inference of confidentiality, the\n           Government is entitled to a presumption.\n\n\nLandano,    U.S. at     , 113 S. Ct. at 2024.    In that case, the\n\nCourt noted, but did not decide, that the sources at issue who\n\nwere witnesses to a gang-related shooting of a police officer,\n\nmight well be presumed to have spoken to the FBI on condition of\n\nanonymity based on the circumstances under which they gave their\n\ninformation.   Id. at    , 113 S. Ct. at 2023.\n\n\n\n\n                                 46\n\f           Moran indicated that all the persons who provided\n\ninformation under an implied promise of confidentiality were\n\nindividuals who \"were past or present members of the WAA;\n\nindividuals who, through their employment, were in a position to\n\nprovide detailed information; or private citizens who attended\n\nWAA meetings.\"   App. at 90.   In its brief, the government\n\nasserts:\n           [T]he Alliance was suspected of being a\n           Communist front and engaging in seditious\n           activities. Given the nature of the\n           activities alleged, it could be presumed that\n           the Alliance would take measures to shield\n           them from law enforcement. Under these\n           circumstances, sources of insider information\n           operated under an implied assurance of\n           confidentiality. The same holds true for\n           individuals who reported matters discussed at\n           Workers Alliance meetings. The Alliance had\n           various chapters or branches located\n           throughout the country. Individuals who\n           attended meetings and then reported to the\n           FBI also did so under an implicit grant of\n           confidentiality. These individuals were\n           exposed to the risk of retaliation by\n           reporting on Alliance business to the FBI,\n           particularly if they were known to other\n           members of the local branch. In short,\n           sources providing detailed information\n           concerning the extent of Communist control of\n           labor organization and possible treasonous\n           activities of that organization would have\n           been concerned \"that exposure would bring\n           harassment, ridicule or retaliation.\" Keys\n           v. Dep't of Justice, 830 F.2d [337,] 345-46\n           [(D.C. Cir. 1987)].\n\n\nGovernment's Brief at 41-42.\n\n           We do not believe that this recitation sufficiently\n\ndescribes circumstances that can provide a basis for inferring\n\nconfidentiality.   The FBI has not offered evidence that any\n\n\n                                 47\n\fmember of the WAA engaged in acts of violence or harassment, or\n\nthreatened to do so.    In light of the fact the government has\n\naccess to documents concerning the WAA spanning a period of forty\n\nyears, we assume that the government would be able to provide\n\nexamples illustrating its contention that the sources allegedly\n\nwere afraid of other WAA members.     The government's citation to\n\nKeys for the proposition that the sources sought implied\n\nassurances of confidentiality actually emphasizes the distinction\n\nbetween the circumstances of the two cases:      Keys involved a\n\nmurder investigation by a foreign operative in which a source\n\nwould have good reason to be afraid \"lest he meet the same fate.\"\n\nKeys, 830 F.2d at 346.\n\n           The government has provided the court with generalized\n\nallegations that the WAA was suspected of \"being a Communist\n\nfront\" and \"engaging in seditious activities.\"     In attempting to\n\nprove that the sources received an implied promise of\n\nconfidentiality, the FBI relies heavily on the presumption that\n\npeople who speak to the FBI necessarily require confidentiality.\n\nApp. at 90-91.   The Supreme Court rejected such a presumption in\n\nLandano.     U.S. at     , 113 S. Ct. at 2022.\n\n           Recently in McDonnell, we were faced with a requester\n\nseeking documents concerning information supplied by an alleged\n\nconfidential source regarding involvement of \"a suspicious or\n\nradical\" member of the crew of a ship, who the FBI suspected was\n\ninvolved with a suspicious fire aboard the ship.     McDonnell, 4\n\nF.3d at 1258.    The government asserted that the information was\n\nexempt because these circumstances established that the source\n\n                                 48\n\fgave his information under an implied promise of confidentiality.\n\nId.   We held that the government did not meet it burden under\n\nLandano and remanded for further proceedings consistent with\n\nprinciples articulated by the Supreme Court.   In the case at\n\nhand, the FBI has not even shown that the persons being\n\ninvestigated were suspected of involvement in violent acts.\n\nAccordingly, as we held in McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1262, on remand,\n\nthe government must provide a further detailed factual recitation\n\nin order to sustain its burden of showing circumstances that\n\nprovide a basis for inferring confidentiality.\n\n          As an added note, we mention the last clause of\n\n§552(b)(7)(D), which exempts from disclosure the information that\n\na confidential source provides in a criminal or national security\n\ninvestigation.   While not directly before us on this appeal, we\n\ndo not foreclose the possibility that the FBI could withhold more\n\ninformation than is justified to protect the identity of\n\nconfidential sources, assuming, of course, the government\n\nadequately demonstrates that the information relates to a\n\ncriminal or national security investigation.\n\n\n\n                         3. § 552(b)(7)(E)\n\n          The FBI has withheld documents and portions of\n\ndocuments under Exemption 7(E), which allows an agency to\n\nwithhold records and information for law enforcement purposes\n\nthat \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions.\"   5 U.S.C.\n\n§552(b)(7)(E).   Exemption 7(E) applies to law enforcement records\n\n                                49\n\fwhich, if disclosed, would risk circumvention of the law.      PHE,\n\nInc. v. Department of Justice, 983 F.2d 248, 249-50 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1993).   This exemption, however, may not be asserted to withhold\n\n\"routine techniques and procedures already well-known to the\n\npublic, such as ballistic tests, fingerprinting, and other\n\nscientific tests commonly known.\"    Ferri, 645 F.2d at 1224\n\n(citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1200, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1974),\n\nreprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6285, 6291).\n\n          The government asserted this exemption, claiming the\n\ntechniques utilized yielded valuable information, and the\n\ndisclosure of certain information \"would reveal the type of\n\neffective investigative techniques and the relative utility of\n\nthese techniques could be diminished.\"   App. at 95.   The\n\ngovernment argues that despite the fact that certain law\n\nenforcement techniques, such as the use of informants, may be\n\nwell known to the public, disclosure is nevertheless not\n\nwarranted where the circumstances surrounding the usefulness of\n\nthese techniques is not well known.    According to the government,\n\n\"the manner in which informants are identified, recruited,\n\ncultivated and handled by the FBI is not well-known,\" which is\n\nespecially true where, as here, \"the FBI is investigating an\n\norganization which is believed to be engaging in illegal\n\nactivities and has taken measures to shield such subversive\n\nactivities from law enforcement.\"    Government Brief at 43.   The\n\ngovernment maintains that groups who are suspected of criminal\n\nwrongdoing today may be provided with information as to how the\n\nFBI recruits internal informants, which may aid the groups in\n\n                                50\n\fdetecting informants currently operating within their ranks.         Id.\n\nat 43-44.\n\n            The government has not offered any proof of these\n\nassertions.    If the government wishes to argue that the\n\ninformation concerning the use of informants in the 1930's is of\n\nsuch a specialized nature that it is still unknown to the public,\n\nthe government must introduce evidence of that fact.    Moreover,\n\nif the government submits evidence that specific documents it has\n\nwithheld contain secret information about techniques for\n\nrecruiting informants, it will have to establish that the release\n\nof this information would risk circumvention of the law.       The\n\nspeculation provided in the government's brief of political\n\ngroups' increased ability to detect informants within their ranks\n\nis not supported by evidence.    Accordingly, on remand, the\n\ngovernment must provide the district court with additional facts\n\nto support exempted documents and portions of documents under\n\nExemption 7(E).\n\n\n\n                                  V.\n\n            Last, the government asserts that information was\n\nexempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(2), which applies\n\nto matters pertaining solely to the internal personnel rules and\n\npractices of an agency.    This exemption pertains to \"routine\n\nmatters\" of \"merely internal significance\" in which the public\n\nlacks any substantial interest.    Department of the Air Force v.\nRose, 425 U.S. 352, 369-70, 96 S. Ct. 1592, 1603 (1976).       The\n\nmaterials claimed to fall within the (b)(2) exemption include the\n\n\n                                  51\n\ffollowing categories of information: (1) permanent source symbols\n\nor code names assigned to confidential informants; (2) the file\n\nnumbers of permanent symbol numbered sources, (3) temporary\n\nsource symbols; and (4) administrative data, practices and\n\nprocedures.   App. at 71-74.\n\n          Agent Moran claimed in his declaration that:\n          Information relative to matters of purely\n          internal, bureaucratic significance has been\n          withheld in certain documents as it pertains\n          to the administrative handling of purely\n          internal functions and policies of the FBI.\n          The information is not of obvious importance\n          in itself; but, if it were released to\n          plaintiff and combines with other known data,\n          in a \"mosaic\" analysis, it could lead to\n          identification of substantive information in\n          the file which has been withheld pursuant to\n          other 5 U.S.C. 552 exemptions. Disclosure of\n          this type of information would not add to the\n          public's understanding of the inner workings\n          of the Government.\n\n          Information has also been deleted from a\n          sample document which relates to FBIHQ\n          instructions to a field office concerning\n          agency business. This material relates to\n          procedures and practices to be followed to\n          effectively support investigative efforts.\n\n\nApp. at 74.\n\n          The government argues that informant codes fall within\n\nthe ambit of Exemption (b)(2).    We agree.   As the Court of\n\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has noted, \"[t]he\n\nmeans by which the FBI refers to informants in its investigative\n\nfiles is a matter of internal significance in which the public\n\nhas no substantial interest.\"    Lesar v. United States Dep't of\n\n\n\n\n                                 52\n\fJustice, 636 F.2d 472, 485-86 (D.C. Cir. 1980);    see also Massey\n\nv. FBI, 3 F.3d 620, 622 (2d Cir. 1993).\n\n          However, the description given by the Moran declaration\n\nprovided the district court with no information as to the content\n\nof any of the withheld documents or portions of documents.\n\nAccordingly, on remand, the government may assert exemptions\n\nunder (b)(2) if the district court is provided with sufficient\n\nfactual support for the withholdings.\n\n\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n          Because the Vaughn affidavit submitted by the\n\ngovernment did not include a specific factual recitation linking\n\nthe documents or portions of documents in question with the\n\nclaimed FOIA exemptions, the district court was not provided with\n\nan adequate factual basis for its determination.   The order of\n\nthe district court granting summary judgment to the government\n\nwas inappropriate because the government did not sufficiently\n\n\"describe the withheld information and the justification for\n\nwithholding with reasonable specificity, demonstrating a logical\n\nconnection between the information and the claimed exemption[s].\"\n\nAmerican Friends, 831 F.2d at 444 (quoting Abbotts, 766 F.2d at\n606).   Accordingly, we will remand this matter to the district\n\ncourt for further fact finding7 and conclusions consistent with\n\nthe principles articulated in this opinion.\n\n7\nFact finding may take the form of ordering a more detailed\nsupplemental Vaughn index and public affidavits. See, e.g.,\nWiener, 943 F.2d at 979; King, 830 F.3d at 225; Ferri, 645 F.2d\nat 1225. If the district court is still concerned that it is\n\n\n                                53\n\funable to make a responsible de novo determination, it may\nproceed with in camera review. 5 U.S.C. § 552 (a)(4)(B). We\nhave discussed elsewhere the factors to be considered in deciding\nwhether in camera review is appropriate. See, e.g., Ferri, 645\nF.2d at 1225-26; Lame I, 654 F.2d at 921-22.\n\n\n                               54\n\f",

In response to a FOIA request by Davin, the FBI\n\nsubmitted to the district court a Vaughn index that set forth\n\ncoded justifications and corresponding explanations for its\n\nwithholding of approximately 7,400 pages of information.     Because\n\nthe Vaughn index submitted by the government did not sufficiently\n\ndescribe the information withheld, the district court did not\n\nhave an adequate factual basis for determining whether the\n\nclaimed exemptions applied to the individual documents.\n\nAccordingly, we will reverse the order of the district court and\n\nremand this matter for further determinations consistent with\n\nprinciples articulated in this opinion.\n\n\n\n                                I.\n\n           Davin is a graduate history student at the University\n\nof Pittsburgh in the field of labor history.   In order to\n\ncomplete his doctoral dissertation, in April 1986 Davin filed a\n\nFOIA request with the FBI seeking \"a complete and thorough search\n\nof all filing systems and locations for all records . . .\n\npertaining to David Lasser and The Workers Alliance of America.\"\n\nApp. at 99 (emphasis in original).   The Workers Alliance of\n\n\n\n                                2\n\fAmerica (\"WAA\") was a nationwide organization representing the\n\ninterests of thousands of unemployed individuals during the\n\n1930's and 1940's.   For a time, the WAA was headed by David\n\nLasser.   Because the WAA did not keep minutes of its meetings,\n\nthere are no other archives of information on its activities.\n\nLasser, who is now in his nineties, has provided the FBI with a\n\nletter authorizing release of his files.\n\n          The WAA was investigated by the FBI during the 1930's\n\nafter the FBI received information that the organization was a\n\nfront for the Communist Party of America.   The purpose of the\n\ninvestigation was to determine the extent of Communist influence,\n\nand the identity of WAA members who were members of the Communist\n\nParty at the time.   The FBI also investigated Lasser.   According\n\nto the FBI, Communists had captured positions of control within\n\nthe WAA by 1936.   In 1940, Lasser resigned, claiming the WAA was\n\na front organization for the Communist Party.\n\n          In response to Davin's request, the FBI located nine\n\nrelevant files at either national headquarters or at the New York\n\nfield office. The FBI described the files as follows:\n          FBIHQ main file, 61-7586, (45 sections)\n          corresponds to NYFO main file, 100-3638, (6\n          sections). Both files pertain to an internal\n          security investigation and were compiled for\n          law enforcement purposes. A 61\n          classification is entitled \"Treason or\n          Misprision of Treason\" and involves\n          violations of Title 18, U.S.C., Sections\n          2381, 2382, 2389, 2390, 756 and 757. A 100\n          classification is entitled \"Domestic\n          Security\" and covers investigations by the\n          FBI in the domestic security field; e.g.,\n          Smith Act violations. The Attorney General\n          declared WAA to be within the purview of\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fExecutive Order 9835, and later Executive\nOrder 10450. The first serial is dated March\n5, 1936, and the last serial is dated October\n21, 1960. . . .\nFBIHQ main file, 124-2592 is a loyalty\ninvestigation of David Lasser consisting of\ntwo sections. This classification covers\nsecurity and loyalty investigations of\npersonnel employed by or under consideration\nof employment with the European Recovery\nProgram. Investigation was conducted under\nPublic Law 472, 80th Congress. The first\nserial in this file is dated January 25,\n1949, and the last serial is dated October\n29, 1951.\n\nFBIHQ main file 121-413, (Loyalty of\nGovernment Employees) consisting of one\nsection, pertains to a preliminary inquiry to\nascertain if David Lasser was associated with\nthe Communist Party or its front\norganizations. Investigation of David Lasser\nunder the provision of Executive Order 9835 .\n. . was instituted by the FBI on April 22,\n1948. The first serial of this file is dated\nOctober 24, 1947, and the last serial is\ndated October 30, 1963.\n\nFBIHQ main file, 151-748 involves one\nsection. This classification covers\nreferrals from the Office of Personnel\nManagement where an allegation has been\nreceived regarding an applicant's loyalty to\nthe U.S. Government. The Agency for\nInternational Development had requested the\nFBI to conduct a full field investigation\nunder the provisions of Public Law 298, The\nForeign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.\nDavid Lasser was interviewed by the FBI in\n1963 under the provisions of Executive Order\n10450 . . . . The first serial is dated\nDecember 12, 1963, and the last serial in\nthis file is dated January 29, 1976.\n\nFBIHQ main file, 126-706 consists of one\nsection concerning a name check request on\nDavid Lasser for clearance for access to\nhighly classified material by National\nSecurity Resources Board. This\nclassification covers background\n\n\n                     4\n\f          investigation conducted on individuals who\n          are to be assigned to duties under the\n          International Development Program. The first\n          and last serials are dated November 14, 1950,\n          and November 15, 1950, respectively.\n\n          FBIHQ main file 65-66314, (Espionage)\n          consisting of one section which contains\n          documentation based on information received\n          concerning the possibility that David Lasser\n          could be some individual who could divert\n          information to the detriment of the defense\n          of the United States. No investigation was\n          conducted. This file was opened on September\n          22, 1960 and closed on September 27, 1960.\n\n          FBIHQ main file, 47-13920 is a two-page file\n          which contains information that a\n          representative of WAA had made a claim that\n          he had authority from the Federal Government\n          to represent individuals in claims of various\n          municipalities. This file was opened and\n          closed on February 19, 1938. This\n          classification is entitled \"Impersonation\"\n          and covers violations of Title 18, U.S.C.,\n          Sections 912, 913, 915, and 916.\n\n          FBIHQ main file, 61-10652 (two sections) was\n          initially compiled to determine if David\n          Lasser might act as an informant for the FBI\n          or if he would be willing to supply details\n          concerning Communist Party activities in WAA.\n          The first serial of this file is dated June\n          20, 1940, and the last document in the file\n          is dated February 8, 1951.\n\nDeclaration of Special Agent Robert A. Moran, App. at 60-63\n(footnotes omitted) [hereinafter all citations to the Appendix\nrefer to the Moran declaration].\n\n\n          The FBI asserts that its records relating to the WAA\n\ntotal approximately 9,200 pages and its records on David Lasser\n\ncontain approximately 1,200 pages.   As of May 18, 1991, the FBI\n\nhad released to Davin only 113 pages regarding the WAA and 150\n\npages on Lasser.\n\n\n\n                               5\n\f           In April 1992, Davin filed a complaint for injunctive\n\nrelief demanding the production of the documents.     Subsequently,\n\npursuant to an agreement between the parties, Davin and the\n\ngovernment submitted a joint motion to stay the case for 130 days\n\nto permit the government to submit a Vaughn index.1    This motion\n\nstipulated that the FBI had reviewed 6,889 documents pursuant to\n\nDavin's FOIA request, had released 2,970 pages to Davin, and\n\nclaimed exemptions to the remaining 3,919 pages.    The joint\n\nmotion further provided that the government would select\n\napproximately 500 documents (roughly every fourteenth or\n\nfifteenth page), compile a Vaughn index and submit it to the\n\ncourt with a motion for summary judgment.\n\n           Included in the government's subsequent motion for\n\nsummary judgment was a declaration by FBI Special Agent Robert\n\nMoran.   The purpose of Moran's declaration was to provide the\n\ncourt and Davin with a description of the material being withheld\n\nand justifications for the government's assertions of FOIA\n\nexemptions to withhold certain information contained in the\n\nrecords.   The declaration consisted of correspondences concerning\n\nDavin's request, an explanation of the FBI's central records\n\nsystem and electronic surveillance index, a list of records\n\npertaining to Davin's request, a sampling and definition of\n\n\n1\nA Vaughn index is an index correlating each withheld document,\nor a portion thereof, with a specific exemption and relevant part\nof an agency's justification for nondisclosure. The Vaughn index\nis a tool designed to aid the court in determining whether the\nagency has properly withheld the information requested. See\nVaughn v.

An explanation of the types of\n\ndocuments in the sampling was also supplied.   Portions of the\n\ndocuments were redacted.   Located in proximity to the redacted\n\nmaterial was a series of letters and numbers which corresponded\n\nto specific FOIA exemptions.   In those instances where an entire\n\npage was redacted, justification code numbers for the withholding\n\nwere substituted for the deleted page.\n\n          To determine the pertinent justification for deleted\n\nmaterial on each processed document, the reader would refer to\n\nthe document in question, note the code number adjacent to the\n\ndeleted material and refer to the corresponding code categories.\n\nThe memorandum then listed twenty-seven justification categories\n\nfor withholding information, along with an explanation of the\n\nvarious categories.\n\n          Moran's declaration listed the FBI Main Files regarding\n\nLasser and the WAA, but did not contain any factual description\n\nof the specific documents and portions of the documents withheld.\n\nInstead, Special Agent Moran offered generic explanations of the\n\n\"justification categories\" used to encode the Vaughn index.    No\n\nspecific index was created to factually link the generic\n\ndescriptions with the encoded deletions, and the explanations\n\nthemselves did not refer to Lasser or the WAA or any other fact\n\n                                7\n\fconnected with this action.    No attempt was made to provide an\n\nindividual rationale for the withholding of specific information.\n\n\n\n          The government asserted that of the 10,400 pages\n\nidentified (9,200 on the WAA and 1,200 on Lasser), 2,970 had been\n\nreleased to Davin and that the remaining pages were being\n\nwithheld under the following FOIA exemptions: (1) Category\n\n(b)(7)(C) Unwarranted Invasion of Personal Privacy; (2) Category\n\n(b)(7)(D) Confidential Source Material; (3) Category (b)(7)(E)\n\nInvestigative Techniques and Procedures; and (4) Category (b)(2)\n\nInformation related Solely to the Internal Personnel Rules and\n\nPractices of an Agency.\n\n          Following receipt of the declaration and exhibits,\n\nDavin filed a motion to compel production of documents for in\n\ncamera review, arguing that the district court could not make an\n\naccurate determination of the validity of the redactions based\n\nupon the government's Vaughn index without review of the\n\ndocuments.    Davin asserted that the government had failed to\n\nprovide any factual information describing the individual\n\ndocuments withheld and thus failed to demonstrate the\n\napplicability of the exemptions it claimed.\n\n             The district court ordered an evidentiary hearing in\n\nwhich Agent Moran testified about twenty-five of the\n\napproximately 7,400 documents that had been withheld.    These\n\ndocuments were selected by Davin from the \"Treason or Misprision\n\nof Treason\" file.    Twenty-two of these pages were blackened out\n\nin their entirety.    Agent Moran described the various categories\n\n                                  8\n\funder which the documents were withheld, although he did not\n\ntestify to the contents of the withheld documents themselves.\n\n           The district court held that Agent Moran's testimony,\n\ntogether with the Vaughn index, demonstrated with \"reasonable\n\nspecificity\" why the documents were exempt from disclosure.\n\nAccordingly, the district court granted the government's motion\n\nfor summary judgment and denied Davin's motion to compel in\n\ncamera examination.

The government offered the\n\ndeclaration of Agent Moran as its Vaughn index.    The Moran\n\ndeclaration described the FBI's generalized FOIA procedures,\n\nincluding a summary of exemption \"justification categories.\"           It\n\nset forth a detailed explanation of the justification categories\n\nused to redact the material included in the declaration.        Each\n\njustification category was denoted by a three or four letter\n\ncode.   These codes appeared next to the redacted portions of the\n\nexhibits.    The government maintains that this declaration, in\n\nconjunction with Agent Moran's testimony, was a sufficiently\n\nadequate Vaughn index that permitted the district court to review\n\nall of the exemption claims advanced.\n\n            In its brief the government provided representative\n\nexamples of the categorical indexing method it used.      For\n\ninstance, the declaration explained that code \"b7D-3\" appearing\n\nnext to the first redacted paragraph means that the information\n\n\n                                 13\n\fwas withheld because it was provided to the FBI by a source who\n\nhad \"received an express promise that it would be held in\n\nconfidence\" and contained information that could lead to the\n\nsource's identity.    App. at 87.    The declaration further\n\nexplained that disclosure had the potential of causing \"great\n\nharm to the source,\" and of harming the FBI because of the\n\n\"chilling effect on the activities and cooperation of other\n\nsources.\"    App. at 88.   As a second example, the government\n\ndemonstrated that the list of names and addresses provided by the\n\nconfidential source were withheld under category \"b7C-6.\"        The\n\ndeclaration explained that this category means that the\n\ninformation was withheld to prevent an unwarranted invasion of\n\nprivacy of the individuals named, since disclosure could\n\n\"announce to the world that they were of investigative interest\n\nto the FBI and therefore permit derogatory inferences to be made\n\ntherefrom.\"    App. at 79.\n\n            The government asserts that the use of a coded index\n\nsystem sufficiently fulfills the functions served by the classic\n\nVaughn index, but in a more efficient and clear manner.        Davin\n\nargues that such a categorical approach, without the inclusion of\n\nspecific factual information that correlates the claimed\n\nexemptions to the withheld documents, is not a sufficient Vaughn\nindex.   We agree with Davin.\n\n            In McDonnell we held that in order for the FBI to\n\nfulfill its burden to establish that materials withheld are\n\nexempt from FOIA, \"[t]he agency may meet this burden by filing\n\naffidavits describing the material withheld and detailing why it\n\n                                    14\n\ffits within the claimed exemption.\"   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1241\n\n(emphasis added) (citing King, 830 F.2d at 217-18).

This\n\nprecedent requires that the agency provide the \"connective\n\ntissue\" between the document, the deletion, the exemption and the\n\nexplanation.    It is insufficient for the agency to simply cite\n\ncategorical codes, and then provide a generic explanation of what\n\nthe codes signify.    See King, 830 F.2d at 223-34 (\"A withholding\n\nagency must describe each document or portion thereof withheld,\n\nand for each withholding it must discuss the consequences of\n\ndisclosing the sought-after information. . . . Categorical\n\ndescription of redacted material coupled with categorical\n\nindication of anticipated consequences of disclosure is clearly\n\ninadequate.\" (emphasis in original)(footnote omitted)).\n\n           In the case at hand, the government's references to\n\ncausing \"great harm to the source,\" App. at 88, and to the\n\npossibility that disclosure could \"announce to the world that\n\nthey were of investigative interest to the FBI and therefore\n\npermit derogatory inferences to be made therefrom,\" App. at 79,\n\nare generic explanations broad enough to apply to any FOIA\n\nrequest.   They are not tied to the content of the specific\n\nredactions.    The justification codes and the explanations offered\n\nby the government lack an explanation of how the release of the\n\n                                 15\n\finformation would violate the privacy interests and pose\n\npotential risk to certain individuals.   Moreover, throughout his\n\ntestimony, Agent Moran reiterated the broad categorical\n\nexplanations recited in his declaration; he did not refer to\n\nspecific facts.   Thus, Agent Moran's testimony sheds no new light\n\non the government's reasons for nondisclosure.\n\n          While the use of the categorical method does not per se\n\nrender a Vaughn index inadequate, an agency using justification\n\ncodes must also include specific factual information concerning\n\nthe documents withheld and correlate the claimed exemptions to\n\nthe withheld documents.

Thus,\n\n\"a coding system might be employed to indicate applicability of a\n\ngiven response to more than one segment of redacted material,\"\n\nbut only \"so long as the information supplied remains responsive\n\n                                16\n\fto each deleted segment without becoming categorical in tenor.\"\n\nId. at 224 (emphasis added).\n\n          The Vaughn index provided by the government affords\n\nDavin little or no meaningful opportunity to argue for release of\n\nparticular documents.   Indeed, the index provides no information\n\nabout particular documents that might be useful in evaluating the\n\npropriety of the decision to withhold.     Because of the paucity of\n\nfactual information related to the district court, the\n\ncategorical justification codes could not provide a sufficient\n\nfactual basis from which the district court could make its\n\ndetermination.   Accordingly, on the record before us, we hold\n\nthat the district court could not fulfill its duty of ruling on\n\nthe applicability of the claimed exemptions on the basis of the\n\ncoded indexing system utilized by the government for its Vaughn\n\nindex.\n\n\n\n                                 B.\n\n          Davin further contends that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to require the FBI to release all reasonably segregable\n\nportions of the sample documents.     Davin also maintains that the\n\nFBI is required under FOIA to provide him with all reasonably\n\nsegregable material of all the 10,000 pages of material, not just\nthe sampled material.   FOIA mandates that \"[a]ny reasonable\n\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person\n\nrequesting such record after deletion of the portions which are\n\nexempt under this subsection.\"   5 U.S.C. § 552(b).

In the case at bar, the only evidence\n\nsubmitted by the government in support of its position was Agent\n\nMoran's conclusory statement that \"[e]very effort has been made\n\nto provide the plaintiff with all reasonably segregable portions\n\non [sic] the sampled material.\"    App. at 67.   Nowhere in Moran's\n\ndeclaration did he describe the process by which he determined\n\nthat all reasonably segregable material of each of the withheld\n\ndocuments or portions of documents had been released.    Nor did\n\nthe government provide a factual recitation of why certain\n\nmaterials are not reasonably segregable.\n\n          In its brief the government points, as an example, to\n\nExhibits C-1 through C-7 which Agent Moran explained had been\n\nprovided by a source under the express promise of\n\nconfidentiality.   Government's Brief at 19-20.    According to the\n\ngovernment, these documents contained a narrative in which a\n\nnumber of individuals involved with the WAA were named.       Exhibit\n\nC-1 bore two coded references: \"b7C-6\" and \"b7D-3.\"     The\n\ngovernment explained that category b7C-6 refers to the names of\n\nindividuals who are of investigative interest to the FBI.\n\nAccording to Moran's declaration, the release of this information\n\nwould constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.    App. at 79-\n\n                                  18\n\f80.   Category b7D-3 indicates that the information was provided\n\nby an individual who had received an express promise of\n\nconfidentiality.   App. at 87.   The government notes that a\n\nportion of C-8 was released because the identity of the\n\nconfidential source could not be ascertained.\n\n          This representative example provided by the government\n\nitself, as an illustration of its proper efforts to provide Davin\n\nwith all reasonably segregable information, in fact reflects the\n\ninadequacy of the government's efforts.    The government fails to\n\nindicate why the privacy interests at stake could not be\n\nprotected simply by redacting particular identifying information.\n\nWithout some further elaboration of the document's contents,\n\nDavin is unable to dispute the FBI's assertion that more\n\ninformation is not segregable.

On remand, the government must\n\nprovide an adequate factual basis for the district court to\n\ndetermine whether Davin has been afforded all reasonably\n\nsegregable information.2\n\n          Furthermore, the government must provide Davin with all\n\nreasonably segregable non-exempt information, not just the non-\n\nexempt information found in the sampled documents.    The\n\ngovernment maintains that it is only required to produce all\n\nreasonably segregable material from the sampled material.      It\n\nclaims that because Davin agreed to a representative sampling of\n\napproximately 500 pages of the 6,689 documents selected he\n\n\"should abide by his decision.\"    Government's Brief at 19.\n\n\n\n2\nIn addition to making findings without sufficient evidentiary\nsupport, the district court may have also erred in holding that\nmore information was not reasonably segregable. Although our\nscope of review on appeal is limited in this context, see\nMcDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1242, it appears that certain information\ncould be disclosed without jeopardizing possibly exempt\ninformation. We note the colloquy between Agent Moran and\ncounsel for Davin regarding the deletions of certain headings in\nthe table of contents of a 200 page report. Agent Moran\ntestified that the deletions did not contain the name of a\nconfidential source or confidential information, but rather the\nheadings were redacted \"because some of the information would\nindicate possibly a particular area of the country\" from where\nthe informant was operating and might, therefore, lead the\nrequester back to the identity of a particular confidential\nsource. App. at 618. We do not find it likely that a reference\nto a particular \"area of the country\" would lead to the identity\nof individuals who were given promises of confidentiality. On\nremand, if after receiving a sufficient factual basis the court\ndetermines that certain information is exempt from disclosure,\nthe district court should reexamine whether seemingly non-\nidentifying information such as this geographical information\nshould also be withheld.\n\n\n                                  20\n\f          The purpose of the Vaughn index is to help specify in a\n\nlarge document which portions of the document are disclosable and\n\nwhich are allegedly exempt.

Section 552(b)(7) provides, in relevant\n\npart, that the following is exempt from disclosure:\n          records or information compiled for law\n          enforcement purposes, but only to the extent\n          that the production of such law enforcement\n          records or information . . .

Indeed, the statute itself treats both \"criminal\ninvestigation[s]\" and \"national security intelligence\ninvestigation[s]\" as subsets of law enforcement records in\nExemption 7(D). Thus, other agencies that have some law\nenforcement duties, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission in investigating violations of Title VII, the Internal\nRevenue Service in enforcing the tax laws, and the National Labor\nRelations Board in conducting unfair labor practice proceedings,\nmay also justify withholding information under Exemption 7.

See Pratt v. Webster,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1982).    In Pratt, the court described the\n\ntwo \"critical conditions\" of what has been named the \"rational\n\nnexus\" rule:\n          First, the agency's investigatory activities\n          that give rise to the documents sought must\n          be related to the enforcement of federal laws\n          or to the maintenance of national security.\n          To satisfy this requirement of a \"nexus,\" the\n\n\n                                  24\n\f          agency should be able to identify a\n          particular individual or a particular\n          incident as the object of its investigation\n          and the connection between that individual or\n          incident and a possible security risk or\n          violation of federal law. The possible\n          violation or security risk is necessary to\n          establish that the agency acted within its\n          principal function of law enforcement, rather\n          than merely engaging in a general monitoring\n          of private individuals' activities. . . .\n\n               Second, the nexus between the\n          investigation and one of the agency's law\n          enforcement duties must be based on\n          information sufficient to support at least \"a\n          colorable claim\" of its rationality. . . .\n          Such an agency, in order to carry out its\n          functions, often must act upon unverified\n          tips and suspicions based upon mere tidbits\n          of information. A court, therefore, should\n          be hesitant to second-guess a law enforcement\n          agency's decision to investigate if there is\n          a plausible basis for its decision. Nor is\n          it necessary for the investigation to lead to\n          a criminal prosecution or other enforcement\n          proceeding in order to satisfy the \"law\n          enforcement purpose\" criterion. . . .\n\n               Thus, . . . [i]n order to pass the FOIA\n          Exemption 7 threshold, such an agency must\n          establish that its investigatory activities\n          are realistically based on a legitimate\n          concern that federal laws have been or may be\n          violated or that national security may be\n          breached. Either of these concerns must have\n          some plausible basis and have a rational\n          connection to the object of the agency's\n          investigation.\n\n\nPratt, 673 F.2d at 420-21 (emphasis in the original) (citations\n\nand footnotes omitted).   See also King, 830 F.2d at 229 (FBI\n\nrecords are not deemed law enforcement records simply by virtue\n\nof the function that the FBI serves, but rather the two-prong\n\nPratt test must be applied to determine the threshold showing\n\n\n\n                                25\n\frequisite).   The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has also\n\nadopted a \"rational nexus\" standard.     See, e.g., Wiener, 943 F.2d\n\nat 985 (\"No withholding under any of the exemptions listed in\n\nsection 552(b)(7) is valid unless the withholding agency\n\nestablishes a '\"rational nexus\" between its law enforcement\n\nduties and the document for which Exemption 7 is claimed.'\"\n\n(citations omitted)).\n\n          We have not directly ruled on what must be established\n\nin order to meet the threshold requirement.    We find, however,\n\nsome guidance from our prior precedents.    In Committee on Masonic\n\nHomes v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"345726\"><a href=\"/opinion/345726/the-committee-on-masonic-homes-of-the-r-w-grand-lodge-f-a-m-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1977), an employer had\n\nrequested from the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") all\n\nunion authorization cards that had been submitted by the union as\n\nevidence of support.    The NLRB claimed that the cards were exempt\n\nfrom disclosure under Exemption 7.     The NLRB argued that it had\n\nan enforcement purpose -- enforcing the National Labor Relations\n\nAct -- for which the union authorization cards under question\n\nwere compiled.   We held that under the circumstances of that\n\ncase, there was no \"law enforcement purpose\" pursuant to\n\nExemption 7, because \"'law enforcement purposes' must relate to\n\nsome type of formal proceedings, and one that is pending.\" Id. at\n219; see also Ferri, 645 F.2d at 1223 (\"[T]he 'investigatory\n\nrecords' exemption is to be construed literally.    It contemplates\n\nfiles compiled with a specific, formal proceeding or\n\ninvestigation in mind.\").\n\n          The precedential force of Masonic Homes can be\nquestioned for two reasons.   First, we decided Masonic Homes\n\n\n                                 26\n\fprior to the 1986 Amendment to FOIA that replaced the language\n\n\"investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\"\n\nwith the present language of § 552(b)(7), \"records or information\n\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes.\"   This amended language\n\ncan appear to have been intended to broaden the exemption's\n\nreach.   We learn from the legislative history, however, that\n\nCongress' action was not intended to modify the threshold showing\n\nof law-enforcement purpose.   The report of the Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee on S. 774, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), stated that\n\nthe amendment \"does not affect the threshold question of whether\n\n'records or information' withheld under (b)(7) were 'compiled for\n\nlaw enforcement purposes.'    This standard would still have to be\n\nsatisfied in order to claim the protection of the (b)(7)\n\nexemption.\"   S. Rep. No. 221, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1983),\n\nreprinted in relevant part in, 132 Cong. Rec. H9466 (daily ed.\n\nOct. 8, 1986); see King, 830 F.2d at 229 n.141 (providing\n\ndetailed legislative history of the 1986 Amendment to Exemption\n\n7).   Accordingly, we can be assured that our holding in Masonic\n\nHomes has not been undercut by legislative fiat.\n\n           Second, because the withholding agency in Masonic Homes\nwas the NLRB, it is unclear whether our conclusion that \"law\n\nenforcement purposes\" must relate to some type of formal\n\nenforcement proceeding, has an application to an agency whose\n\nprincipal function is criminal law enforcement.    See Pratt, 673\n\nF.2d at 421 n.33 (\"We believe that the Third Circuit's conclusion\n\nthat '\"law enforcement purposes\" must relate to some type of\n\nenforcement proceeding, and one that is pending,' has no\n\n                                 27\n\fapplication to an agency whose principal function is criminal law\n\nenforcement.   Therefore, we also dismiss the First Circuit's\n\nconcern . . . that the need to shield legitimate law enforcement\n\nefforts from harmful FOIA disclosures might lead to frivolous\n\nprosecutions.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n           While we are not bound to extend our holding in Masonic\n\nHomes to a law enforcement agency such as the FBI, at minimum,\n\nour statements in Masonic Homes indicate a rejection of a per se\n\nrule.   Accordingly, we must devise a test to apply to law\n\nenforcement agencies that requires the agency to sustain its\n\nburden of establishing the threshold element of Exemption 7.\n\n           We believe the preferable test is an adaptation of the\n\ntwo-prong \"rational nexus\" test articulated by the Court of\n\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Pratt.   Under\n\nthis test, the government must identify a particular individual\n\nor incident as the object of the investigation and specify the\n\nconnection of the individual or incident to a potential violation\n\nof law or security risk.   The agency must then demonstrate that\n\nthis relationship is based upon information \"sufficient to\n\nsupport at least a 'colorable claim' of its rationality.\"      Pratt,\n673 F.2d at 421.\n\n           The D.C. Circuit has explained that the threshold\n\nshowing required by Pratt is an \"objective\" one, and \"suffices to\n\nestablish the exemption only if it is unrefuted by persuasive\n\nevidence that in fact another, nonqualifying reason prompted the\n\ninvestigation,\" such as where an investigation is conducted \"for\n\n\n\n                                28\n\fpurposes of harassment.\"   Shaw v.

See supra at   [typescript at 3-\n\n5].   The declaration clearly identifies David Lasser and the WAA\n\nas the targets of the investigations, thereby fulfilling the\n\nfirst prong of the Pratt test.    The declaration, however, plainly\n\nfailed to specify the connection between Lasser and the WAA, and\n\nthe possible security risk or violation of federal law.\n\n           As a preliminary matter, the declaration only contained\n\na general description of the files and did not describe the nexus\n\nbetween each document and a particular investigation.   Indeed,\n\nthe government failed even to identify the investigations to\n\nwhich each document in the nine FBI files pertained.\n\n           Furthermore, the declaration does little more than cite\n\nto the criminal statutes, executive orders, and public laws\n\npursuant to which the investigations were undertaken, \"presumably\n\nindicating that somewhere within the parameters of these general\n\nprovisions were criminal acts that the FBI suspected [Lasser and\n\nthe WAA] of committing.\"   King, 830 F.2d at 230.   While the\n\nsecond prong inquiry is \"necessarily deferential\" to the agency,\n\nPratt, 673 F.2d at 421, we believe that the simple recitation of\n\nstatutes, orders and public laws is an insufficient showing of a\n\nrational nexus to a legitimate law enforcement concern.   The FBI\n\nhas failed to meet its burden in the district court because\n\nneither Agent Moran's declaration nor his testimony provide any\n\n                                 29\n\fdetail concerning the supposed law enforcement activities that\n\ngenerated each of the documents in the Vaughn index.      The FBI\n\nmust come forward with additional evidence to support its claim\n\nof a law enforcement purpose.\n\n            In addition, we note that even the skeletal\n\ndescriptions of the files provided by Agent Moran cast doubt on\n\nthe government's assertion that the files were related to a law\n\nenforcement purpose: while the nine files cover investigations\n\nspanning over forty years, the government has not pointed to a\n\nsingle arrest, indictment or conviction.\n\n            We acknowledge that the Supreme Court has indicated\n\nthere is no requirement for the compilation of information to be\n\neffected by a specific time.

Nor do we\n\nrequire evidence of an actual indictment or conviction in order\n\nfor the government to fulfill its burden of proving that its\n\ninvestigation pertained to a law enforcement purpose.     However,\n\non the record before us, the government must allege additional\n\nspecific facts that demonstrate \"the agency was gathering\n\ninformation with the good faith belief that the subject may\n\nviolate or has violated federal law,\" and was not \"merely\n\nmonitoring the subject for purposes unrelated to enforcement of\n\nthe law.\"   Lamont v. Department of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1688134\"><a href=\"/opinion/1688134/lamont-v-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

If the government's investigation did not ultimately\n\nresult in any arrests, indictments or other proceedings, then the\n\ngovernment may sustain its burden under § 552(b)(7) by explaining\n\n                                 30\n\fwhy it decided not to follow through with the investigations. The\n\nVaughn index in this case, however, provides Davin with no\n\ninformation whatsoever about the initiation, breadth or results\n\nof the investigations.   The paucity of information about these\n\nlengthy investigations casts doubt on the government's assertion\n\nthat withheld documents pertain to law enforcement\n\ninvestigations, and has made impossible Davin's challenge to the\n\ngovernment's claim.\n\n          The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was faced\n\nwith similar circumstances in Wiener, where the FBI refused to\n\nrelease files to a historian concerning political investigations\n\nof John Lennon.   In that case, the FBI claimed Exemption 7,\n\nalleging that:\n          John Lennon was under investigation for\n          possible violations of the Civil Disobedience\n          Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. § 231 (1988), and the\n          Anti-Riot Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2101 (1988),\n          because of his association with a radical\n          group known as the Election Year Strategy\n          Information Center (EYSIC).\n\n\nWiener, 943 F.2d at 985-96.   The court rejected the FBI's claims,\n\nholding that:\n          The Civil Disobedience Act and the Anti-Riot\n          Act are very broad criminal statutes,\n          prohibiting a wide variety of conduct.\n          Citations to these statues do little to\n          inform Wiener of the claimed law enforcement\n          purpose underlying the investigation of John\n          Lennon. Without providing Wiener with\n          further details of the kinds of criminal\n          activity of which John Lennon was allegedly\n          suspected, Wiener cannot effectively argue\n          that the claimed law enforcement purpose was\n          in effect a pretext.\n\n\n\n\n                                31\n\fId. at 986.\n\n            The statutes that criminalize treason, misprision of\n\ntreason, recruiting for service against the United States, and\n\nthe other criminal activities that the FBI was \"investigating\"\n\nare no less broad than the Civil Disobedience Act or the Anti-\n\nRiot Act.    The FBI's blanket references to these statutes do not\n\nadequately inform Davin of the claimed law enforcement purposes\n\nof the FBI investigation of the WAA and Lasser.     Accordingly, on\n\nremand, the government must provide additional facts regarding\n\nthe law enforcement investigations implicated by each of the\n\ndocuments withheld under any (b)(7) exemption.\n\n\n\n                                  B.\n\n            If, on remand, the district court concludes that the\n\ngovernment has demonstrated a rational nexus between its law\n\nenforcement duties and the particular document or portions\n\nwithheld, then the district court will reach the specific\n\nexemptions of subsections of § 552(b)(7).      The government asserts\n\nthat information was exempt from disclosure under subsection\n\n(7)(C) Unwarranted Invasion of Personal Privacy, (7)(D)\n\nConfidential Source Material, and (7)(E) Investigative Techniques\n\nand Procedures.    We will address each exemption seriatim.\n\n\n\n                         1.   § 552(b)(7)(C)\n\n            Exemption 7(C) permits withholding of records or\n\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes to the extent\n\nthat production \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an\n\n                                  32\n\funwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\"   5 U.S.C.\n\n§552(b)(7)(C).   Agent Moran identified nine privacy interests\n\nthat implicated Exemption 7(C): (1) the identities or identifiers\n\nof FBI personnel; (2) the names and identifying data of financial\n\ninstitution or commercial enterprise employees; (3) identities of\n\nnon-FBI federal government employees; (4) names and identifying\n\ndata of non-federal government law enforcement officers; (5)\n\nnames and identifying data of state and local government\n\nemployees; (6) names and identifying data pertaining to third\n\nparties who were of investigative interest; (7) names and\n\nidentifying data for third parties who were merely mentioned; (8)\n\nfile numbers related to third parties; and (9) names and\n\nidentifying information of individuals who provided information\n\nto the FBI.\n\n          We set forth the standards for evaluating a 7(C) claim\n\nin Lame I, where we held:\n          The Section 7(C) privacy exemption does not\n          prohibit all disclosures which invade\n          personal privacy, but only disclosures which\n          entail an unwarranted invasion of personal\n          privacy . . . . \"Exemption 7(C)'s protection\n          of personal privacy is not absolute . . . .\n          [T]he proper approach to [a] request under a\n          privacy based exemption such as 7(C) is a de\n          novo balancing test, weighing the privacy\n          interest and the extent to which it is\n          invaded on the one hand, against the public\n          benefit that would result from disclosure, on\n          the other.\"\n\n\nLame I, 654 F.2d at 922-23 (quoting Ferri, 645 F.2d at 1217).

Suspects, interviewees and witnesses have a privacy\n\ninterest because disclosure may result in embarrassment or\n\nharassment.     Id.    Law enforcement personnel involved in a\n\ncriminal investigation also have a cognizable privacy interest\n\nunder FOIA.     Id. (citing Patterson, 893 F.2d at 601).\n\n            Accordingly, the individuals involved in the\n\ninvestigations of David Lasser and the WAA have a privacy\n\ninterest in not having their identities disclosed.4          We note that\n\n4\nWe note again the colloquy between Agent Moran and counsel for\nDavin, in which Agent Moran concedes that certain information was\n\n                                      34\n\ffor some, the privacy interest may become diluted by the passage\n\nof time, though under certain circumstances the potential for\n\nembarrassment and harassment may also endure.   Id. at 427.     Thus,\n\nwhen balancing the private and public interests, the district\n\ncourt must determine the relative strength of an individual's\n\nprivacy interest.\n\n          The government and Davin dispute whether death\n\nextinguishes an individual's privacy rights under FOIA, and if\n\nso, whether the government is required to determine if the\n\nindividual is still alive.    The first issue has been settled by\n\nour holding in McDonnell, where we expressly announced that under\n\n§ 552(b)(7)(C), \"[p]ersons who are deceased have no privacy\n\ninterest in nondisclosure of their identities.\"    McDonnell, 4\n\nF.3d at 1257.   Furthermore, with regard to a claimed privacy\n\nexemption under § 552(b)(6), the exemption from disclosure of\n\npersonnel and medical files, we directed the government to\n\ndetermine whether the subject of a FOIA request was deceased or\n\nliving.   Id. at 1254.   While we recognize that the standard for\n\nevaluating privacy interests pursuant to Exemption 7(C) is\n\nsomewhat broader that the standard for Exemption 6, see Reporters\nCommittee, 489 U.S. at 756, 109 S. Ct. at 1473, we nonetheless do\n\n\nredacted pursuant to Exemption 7(C) \"[b]ecause some of the\ninformation would indicate possibly a particular area of the\ncountry\" from where an informant was operating, which might lead\nthe requester to the informant's identity. App. at 618. See\nsupra note 2. While the FBI may assert individuals' privacy\ninterest in not having their identities disclosed, the privacy\ninterest only extends to the individuals' names and street\naddresses, which need not be revealed, but not to cities,\noccupations, or other \"identifiers.\"\n\n\n                                 35\n\fnot perceive legitimate grounds for distinguishing between (b)(6)\n\nand (b)(7)(C) on this issue.\n\n           The government voices a concern, however, that to\n\nrequire the FBI to determine whether all of the hundreds of\n\nindividuals who are named in the files requested by Davin are\n\nalive \"would place a great, if not intolerable burden, on the\n\nFBI.\"   Government Brief at 33.   We are mindful that the Supreme\n\nCourt has recognized a congressional intent \"to provide\n\n'\"workable\" rules' of FOIA disclosure.\"   Landano,     U.S. at      ,\n\n113 S. Ct. at 2023 (citations omitted).   Accordingly, we hold\n\nthat it is within the discretion of the district court to require\n\nan agency to demonstrate that the individuals upon whose behalf\n\nit claims the privacy exemption are, in fact, alive.     In\n\nexercising its discretion, the district court should consider\n\nsuch factors as the number of named individuals that must be\n\ninvestigated, and the age of the requested records.     If the\n\nnumber of individuals is not excessive, the agency could be\n\nrequired to determine whether the individuals are alive before\n\nasserting a privacy interest on their behalf.   However, after a\n\nsufficient passage of time -- such as in our case where the\n\npertinent investigations began over sixty years ago (and in\n\nMcDonnell where the investigation began over seventy years before\nthe FOIA request) -- the probability of the named individuals\n\nremaining alive diminishes.    Under such circumstances, it would\n\nbe unreasonable for the district court not to assume that many of\n\nthe individuals named in the requested records have died, thereby\n\nnegating a privacy interest unless proving otherwise.\n\n                                  36\n\f                         b. Public Benefit\n\n          The Reporters Committee decision also guides us in\n\nidentifying the relevant \"public benefits\" to be weighed against\n\nthe asserted privacy interests. The Supreme Court declared that:\n          whether disclosure of a private document\n          under Exemption 7(C) is warranted must turn\n          on the nature of the requested document and\n          its relationship to \"the basic purpose of the\n          Freedom of Information Act 'to open agency\n          action to the light of public scrutiny'\"\n          Department of Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S.\n          [352], 372, 96 S. Ct.

Ct. at 1481.\nAccordingly, \"[o]fficial information that sheds light on an\n\nagency's performance of its statutory duties falls squarely\n\nwithin that statutory purpose.   That purpose, however, is not\n\nfostered by disclosure of information about private citizens that\n\nis accumulated in various government files but that reveals\n\nlittle or nothing about an agency's own conduct.\"   Id. at 773,\n\n109 S.

The\n\n\n\n                                 37\n\fdistrict court must determine, however, whether that purpose is\n\nfostered by disclosure of the identities of private citizens.\n\n          We are cognizant of the government's stated\n\njustification for withholding: (1) names and identifying data of\n\nnon-federal law enforcement officers because \"disclosure of their\n\nidentities would inhibit the cooperation and exchange of\n\ninformation between law enforcement officials and the FBI, and\n\nwould suppress a vital source of information that the FBI relies\n\nupon in order to pursue investigative interests against alleged\n\ncriminals, suspects or subjects of investigations,\" App. at 78;\n\nand (2) identities of third parties who furnished information to\n\nthe FBI because disclosure \"would seriously impede the FBI's\n\nability to gather future information.\"    App. at 81.   We held in\n\nMcDonnell that \"the Government's asserted interest in assuring\n\nfuture cooperation of witnesses with FBI investigations is not a\n\nvalid reason for refusing to disclose information under Exemption\n\n7(C).\"   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1256.   Accordingly, neither the FBI\n\nnor the district court may consider this factor in considering\n\nthe public benefit of withholding the information.\n\n\n\n            c. Balancing Private and Public Interests\n\n          Davin and the government disagree over how to perform\nthe balancing between private and public interests.     Davin refers\n\nus to our decision in Lame I, where we emphasized that \"[t]here\n\ncan be no question that the 7(C) balancing test must be conducted\n\nwith regard to each document, because the privacy interest and\n\nthe interest of the public in disclosure may vary from document\n\n                                38\n\fto document.   Indeed, these interests may vary from portion to\n\nportion of an individual document.\"   Lame I, 654 F.2d at 923\n\n(footnote omitted).    In that case, we concluded that the FBI's\n\nrefusal to disclose most of the witness interview transcripts\n\ncould not be justified under Exemption 7(C), without explaining\n\nwhy the interviews would result in embarrassment or harassment\n\neither to the individuals interviewed or to third parties.      Id.\n\nat 928.\n\n           The government, in contrast, notes that the Supreme\n\nCourt in Reporters Committee permitted agencies to exempt certain\n\nrecords categorically, as opposed to on a document-by-document\n\nbasis.    In Reporters Committee, the Court stated that\n\n\"categorical decisions may be appropriate and individual\n\ncircumstances disregarded when a case fits into a genus in which\n\nthe balance characteristically tips in one direction,\" 489 U.S.\n\nat 776, 109 S. Ct. at 1483, and concluded that \"rap sheet\"\n\ninformation is categorically exempt under § 522(b)(7)(C) because\n\nthe release of such information always constitutes an unwarranted\n\ninvasion of privacy.   Id. at 780, 109 S. Ct. at 1485.\n\n           While we believe that in the usual circumstance, an\n\nindividual's privacy interest in not having his or her identity\n\nrevealed in the context of a criminal or national security\n\ninvestigation overrides the public benefit, we will refrain from\n\nextending Reporters Committee to require a per se rule.    We\n\nsimilarly did not apply the categorical balancing approach in\n\nLandano, when we determined that FBI informants and agents had a\nprivacy interest in not having their names disclosed in\n\n\n                                 39\n\fconnection with a criminal investigation, which outweighed the\n\nasserted public interest (not recognized by FOIA) in discovering\n\nwrongdoing by a state agency.   Landano, 956 F.2d at 430-31.\n\n          Accordingly, while we do not comment on the proper\n\nresult of the balancing in this matter, we find it important to\n\nnote that the government must conduct a document by document\n\nfact-specific balancing.   Agent Moran dispatched all of the 7(C)\n\nexemptions claimed in the 9,270 pages withheld by stating that in\n\neach instance where information was withheld:\n          it was determined that individual privacy\n          interests were not outweighed by any public\n          interest. When the documents at issue were\n          reviewed . . . the passage of time and any\n          effect on the third party privacy interests\n          were considered. It was determined that the\n          privacy interests are stronger now than they\n          were when the records were created. To\n          reveal names in the context of these records\n          could reasonably be expected, due to the type\n          of the investigation to put the lives of\n          individuals in danger, cause embarrassment\n          and humiliation, and would therefore, be an\n          unwarranted invasion of privacy. The\n          disclosure of this information would not\n          contribute significantly to the public's\n          understanding of the operations or activities\n          of the Government.\n\n\nApp. at 75.   This explanation stands in stark contrast to\n\nMcDonnell, where \"[t]he Government set forth in an affidavit\n\nspecific reasons why these persons have a privacy interest in\n\nnondisclosure of their identities.\"   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1255.\n\nAgent Moran's affidavit and testimony, and consequently, the\n\ndistrict court's findings, did not link the (b)(7)(C) exemption\n\nto any of the individual documents.   On remand, the government\n\n\n\n                                40\n\fmust provide the district court with a more detailed balancing\n\neffort.\n\n\n\n                           2. § 552(b)(7)(D)\n\n           Exemption 7(D) excepts from disclosure records or\n\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to\n\nthe extent that the production:\n          could reasonably be expected to disclose the\n          identity of a confidential source, . . .\n          which furnished information on a confidential\n          basis, and, in the case of a record or\n          information compiled by criminal law\n          enforcement authority in the course of a\n          criminal investigation or by an agency\n          conducting a lawful national security\n          intelligence investigation, information\n          furnished by a confidential source.\n\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D).    See also McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1257.\n\n           The Supreme Court recently set forth the standards for\n\nwithholding a document under Exemption 7(D) in Landano.      The\n\nSupreme Court explained that a source is considered a\n\n\"confidential source\" only \"if the source `provided information\n\nunder an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances\n\nfrom which such an assurance could reasonably be inferred.'\"\n\nLandano,    U.S. at   , 113 S. Ct. at 2019-20 (quoting H.R. Conf.\n\nRep.

Landano,   U.S. at   , 113 S. Ct. at 2019.   The Court\n\nembarked on its discussion of implied assurances of\n\nconfidentiality after noting that the FBI in that case could not\n\nattempt to demonstrate that it made explicit promises of\n\nconfidentiality, because \"[t]hat sort of proof apparently often\n\nis not possible: The FBI does not have a policy of discussing\n\nconfidentiality with every source, and when such discussions do\n\noccur, agents do not always document them.\"    Id. at   , 113 S.\n\nCt. at 2020.   We glean from these remarks that if an agency\n\nattempts to withhold information under Exemption 7(D) by express\n\nassurances of confidentiality, the agency is required to come\n\nforward with probative evidence that the source did in fact\n\nreceive an express grant of confidentiality.   Proof could take\n\nthe form of declarations from the agents who extended the express\n\ngrants of confidentiality, contemporaneous documents from the FBI\n\n                                42\n\ffiles reflecting the express grants of confidentiality, evidence\n\nof a consistent policy of expressly granting confidentiality to\n\ncertain designated sources during the relevant time period, or\n\nother such evidence that comports with the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence.\n\n            Rather than provide such proof, the government submits\n\nAgent Moran's declaration that asserts an alleged policy of the\n\nFBI to grant express assurances of confidentiality on a routine\n\nbasis.5   The declaration fails to cite any written policy or\n\n5\nAgent Moran stated in his declaration:\n\n            Exemption (b)(7)(D) was asserted to withhold\n            information received from a source under an\n            express promise that it would be held in\n            confidence, as well as information that could\n            lead to the source's identity. These sources\n            are symbol numbered sources, code name\n            sources, or individuals who specifically\n            requested confidentiality . . . .\n            As a matter of policy and practice, all\n            symbol numbered informants or code names\n            sources are given express assurances of\n            confidentiality. Illustrative of this\n            express assurance of confidentiality is the\n            manner in which such information is treated\n            within the FBI. The identities of such\n            sources are not referred to by the true name\n            in any FBI document which records the\n            information they furnished. The identities\n            of these sources are known to very few FBI\n            employees and are available only on a \"need\n            to know\" basis. These special precautions\n            are needed because of the sensitive nature of\n            the information being provided and harm that\n            may befall these sources if their identities\n            were revealed. The manner in which the FBI\n            actually obtains information from these\n            sources is also demonstrative of the express\n            assurance of confidentiality under which it\n            is received. The information is received\n            only under conditions which guarantee the\n\n\n                                 43\n\fprovide any assurance that the alleged policy has been applied\n\nconsistently over the years, and in this specific case.     There is\n\nno proof that these particular sources received express grants of\n\nconfidentiality.\n\n          The government argues that we indicated in McDonnell\n\nthat courts may rely upon agency declarations in determining\n\nwhether a source has received an express assurance of\n\nconfidentiality.   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1258.   In that case, we\n\nheld that the district court did not err in adopting the\n\nmagistrate judge's conclusion that the identity of and\n\ninformation provided by two specific sources were exempt from\n\ndisclosure under (b)(7)(D) when the declaration stated one source\n\nwas given express assurance of confidentiality and the other\n\nsource was assigned a symbol source number and was never referred\n\nto by name in the file.   Id.   The government also cites Wiener,\n\n943 F.2d at 986, where the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\n\nheld that the FBI \"need only establish the informant was told his\n\nname would be held in confidence.\"\n\n          These holdings do not support the government's\n\nassertion that it has sufficiently established that sources\n\nreceived express grants of confidentiality.     In McDonnell, the\nagent provided information regarding the circumstances\n\n\n          contact will not be jeopardized. Derivative\n          ensuing investigations attributable to a\n          symbol numbered source have also been denied\n          as disclosure of such would reveal the\n          identity of the source.\n\nApp. at 87-88.\n\n\n                                 44\n\fsurrounding the interviews in which express grants of\n\nconfidentiality were given to the two specific sources in\n\nquestion.   McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1257-58.6   No such specifics are\n\nprovided in the Moran declaration in this case.    Furthermore,\n\nwhile the Wiener court required the FBI to \"establish the\n\ninformant was told his name would be held in confidence,\" the FBI\n\nhas failed to do so in this case since the government did not\n\npresent any evidence of its alleged policy or any evidence that\n\nan express grant of confidentiality was in fact given to any\n\nparticular source.\n\n            On remand, the government, if it pursues an exception\n\nfor express promises of confidentiality, must produce evidence of\n\n6\nIn McDonnell, we held that the district court did not err in\nadopting the magistrate judge's conclusion that the identity of a\ncertain source was exempt from disclosure under Exemption 7(D),\nwhen, based on Agent Llewellyn's declaration, the magistrate\njudge \"determined that the Government gave an express assurance\nof confidentiality to an informant named in the files . . . . The\nidentity of this source was considered so sensitive that he or\nshe was assigned a symbol source number and was never referred to\nby name in the file.\" McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1258. While these\nstatements may appear to imply that the FBI only pointed to its\nsymbol source number policy to show that the sources received\nexpress grants of confidentiality, it is clear from reading\nMcDonnell that the agent's declaration in fact provided detailed\ninformation regarding the circumstances of the express grants of\nconfidentiality to the two specific sources involved in the\ninvestigation. We wrote: \"At oral argument on the parties'\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the magistrate judge ordered\nthe FBI to submit a declaration regarding the circumstances\nsurrounding the interviews of third parties who were members of\nthe public. This order was in response to two letters McDonnell\nhas submitted from interviewees stating that they had not\nreceived either express or implied assurances of confidentiality\nwhen the FBI interviewed them.\" Id. at 1257 (emphasis added). In\nresponse to this directive, the FBI submitted Agent Llewellyn's\ndeclaration, which presumably, fulfilled the magistrate judge's\norder.\n\n\n                                 45\n\fits alleged policy and practice of giving all symbol numbered\n\ninformants or code name sources express assurances of\n\nconfidentiality, evidence that the policy was in force throughout\n\nthe forty years spanned by the documents at issue, and evidence\n\nthat the policy was applied to each of the separate\n\ninvestigations and in each case in which a document or portion\n\nhas been withheld.\n\n           In addition to claiming that sources were given express\n\npromises of confidentiality, the government also asserts that\n\nsome sources gave the FBI information under \"an implied promise\n\nof confidentiality.\"    App. at 89.   In Landano, the Supreme Court\n\nexplained that:\n          the Government is not entitled to a\n          presumption that a source is confidential\n          within the meaning of Exemption 7(D) whenever\n          the source provides information to the FBI in\n          the course of a criminal investigation.\n\n                More narrowly defined circumstances\n           however, can provide a basis for inferring\n           confidentiality. For example, when\n           circumstances such as the nature of the crime\n           investigated and the witness' relation to it\n           support an inference of confidentiality, the\n           Government is entitled to a presumption.\n\n\nLandano,    U.S. at     , 113 S. Ct. at 2024.    In that case, the\n\nCourt noted, but did not decide, that the sources at issue who\n\nwere witnesses to a gang-related shooting of a police officer,\n\nmight well be presumed to have spoken to the FBI on condition of\n\nanonymity based on the circumstances under which they gave their\n\ninformation.   Id. at    , 113 S. Ct. at 2023.\n\n\n\n\n                                 46\n\f           Moran indicated that all the persons who provided\n\ninformation under an implied promise of confidentiality were\n\nindividuals who \"were past or present members of the WAA;\n\nindividuals who, through their employment, were in a position to\n\nprovide detailed information; or private citizens who attended\n\nWAA meetings.\"   App. at 90.   In its brief, the government\n\nasserts:\n           [T]he Alliance was suspected of being a\n           Communist front and engaging in seditious\n           activities. Given the nature of the\n           activities alleged, it could be presumed that\n           the Alliance would take measures to shield\n           them from law enforcement. Under these\n           circumstances, sources of insider information\n           operated under an implied assurance of\n           confidentiality. The same holds true for\n           individuals who reported matters discussed at\n           Workers Alliance meetings. The Alliance had\n           various chapters or branches located\n           throughout the country. Individuals who\n           attended meetings and then reported to the\n           FBI also did so under an implicit grant of\n           confidentiality. These individuals were\n           exposed to the risk of retaliation by\n           reporting on Alliance business to the FBI,\n           particularly if they were known to other\n           members of the local branch. In short,\n           sources providing detailed information\n           concerning the extent of Communist control of\n           labor organization and possible treasonous\n           activities of that organization would have\n           been concerned \"that exposure would bring\n           harassment, ridicule or retaliation.\" Keys\n           v. Dep't of Justice, 830 F.2d [337,] 345-46\n           [(D.C. Cir. 1987)].\n\n\nGovernment's Brief at 41-42.\n\n           We do not believe that this recitation sufficiently\n\ndescribes circumstances that can provide a basis for inferring\n\nconfidentiality.   The FBI has not offered evidence that any\n\n\n                                 47\n\fmember of the WAA engaged in acts of violence or harassment, or\n\nthreatened to do so.    In light of the fact the government has\n\naccess to documents concerning the WAA spanning a period of forty\n\nyears, we assume that the government would be able to provide\n\nexamples illustrating its contention that the sources allegedly\n\nwere afraid of other WAA members.     The government's citation to\n\nKeys for the proposition that the sources sought implied\n\nassurances of confidentiality actually emphasizes the distinction\n\nbetween the circumstances of the two cases:      Keys involved a\n\nmurder investigation by a foreign operative in which a source\n\nwould have good reason to be afraid \"lest he meet the same fate.\"\n\nKeys, 830 F.2d at 346.\n\n           The government has provided the court with generalized\n\nallegations that the WAA was suspected of \"being a Communist\n\nfront\" and \"engaging in seditious activities.\"     In attempting to\n\nprove that the sources received an implied promise of\n\nconfidentiality, the FBI relies heavily on the presumption that\n\npeople who speak to the FBI necessarily require confidentiality.\n\nApp. at 90-91.   The Supreme Court rejected such a presumption in\n\nLandano.     U.S. at     , 113 S. Ct. at 2022.\n\n           Recently in McDonnell, we were faced with a requester\n\nseeking documents concerning information supplied by an alleged\n\nconfidential source regarding involvement of \"a suspicious or\n\nradical\" member of the crew of a ship, who the FBI suspected was\n\ninvolved with a suspicious fire aboard the ship.     McDonnell, 4\n\nF.3d at 1258.    The government asserted that the information was\n\nexempt because these circumstances established that the source\n\n                                 48\n\fgave his information under an implied promise of confidentiality.\n\nId.   We held that the government did not meet it burden under\n\nLandano and remanded for further proceedings consistent with\n\nprinciples articulated by the Supreme Court.   In the case at\n\nhand, the FBI has not even shown that the persons being\n\ninvestigated were suspected of involvement in violent acts.\n\nAccordingly, as we held in McDonnell, 4 F.3d at 1262, on remand,\n\nthe government must provide a further detailed factual recitation\n\nin order to sustain its burden of showing circumstances that\n\nprovide a basis for inferring confidentiality.\n\n          As an added note, we mention the last clause of\n\n§552(b)(7)(D), which exempts from disclosure the information that\n\na confidential source provides in a criminal or national security\n\ninvestigation.   While not directly before us on this appeal, we\n\ndo not foreclose the possibility that the FBI could withhold more\n\ninformation than is justified to protect the identity of\n\nconfidential sources, assuming, of course, the government\n\nadequately demonstrates that the information relates to a\n\ncriminal or national security investigation.\n\n\n\n                         3. § 552(b)(7)(E)\n\n          The FBI has withheld documents and portions of\n\ndocuments under Exemption 7(E), which allows an agency to\n\nwithhold records and information for law enforcement purposes\n\nthat \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law\n\nenforcement investigations or prosecutions.\"   5 U.S.C.\n\n§552(b)(7)(E).   Exemption 7(E) applies to law enforcement records\n\n                                49\n\fwhich, if disclosed, would risk circumvention of the law.      PHE,\n\nInc. v.

No. 1200, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1974),\n\nreprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6285, 6291).\n\n          The government asserted this exemption, claiming the\n\ntechniques utilized yielded valuable information, and the\n\ndisclosure of certain information \"would reveal the type of\n\neffective investigative techniques and the relative utility of\n\nthese techniques could be diminished.\"   App. at 95.   The\n\ngovernment argues that despite the fact that certain law\n\nenforcement techniques, such as the use of informants, may be\n\nwell known to the public, disclosure is nevertheless not\n\nwarranted where the circumstances surrounding the usefulness of\n\nthese techniques is not well known.    According to the government,\n\n\"the manner in which informants are identified, recruited,\n\ncultivated and handled by the FBI is not well-known,\" which is\n\nespecially true where, as here, \"the FBI is investigating an\n\norganization which is believed to be engaging in illegal\n\nactivities and has taken measures to shield such subversive\n\nactivities from law enforcement.\"    Government Brief at 43.   The\n\ngovernment maintains that groups who are suspected of criminal\n\nwrongdoing today may be provided with information as to how the\n\nFBI recruits internal informants, which may aid the groups in\n\n                                50\n\fdetecting informants currently operating within their ranks.         Id.\n\nat 43-44.\n\n            The government has not offered any proof of these\n\nassertions.    If the government wishes to argue that the\n\ninformation concerning the use of informants in the 1930's is of\n\nsuch a specialized nature that it is still unknown to the public,\n\nthe government must introduce evidence of that fact.    Moreover,\n\nif the government submits evidence that specific documents it has\n\nwithheld contain secret information about techniques for\n\nrecruiting informants, it will have to establish that the release\n\nof this information would risk circumvention of the law.       The\n\nspeculation provided in the government's brief of political\n\ngroups' increased ability to detect informants within their ranks\n\nis not supported by evidence.    Accordingly, on remand, the\n\ngovernment must provide the district court with additional facts\n\nto support exempted documents and portions of documents under\n\nExemption 7(E).\n\n\n\n                                  V.\n\n            Last, the government asserts that information was\n\nexempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(2), which applies\n\nto matters pertaining solely to the internal personnel rules and\n\npractices of an agency.    This exemption pertains to \"routine\n\nmatters\" of \"merely internal significance\" in which the public\n\nlacks any substantial interest.
