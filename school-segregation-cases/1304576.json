Haniffa Cassim, and nurses Rosendo Florentin and Patricia Kim,\nafter the trial court granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment. We reverse\nthe judgment in favor of the County, affirm the judgment in favor of Wallace, Cassim,\nFlorentin, and Kim, and remand with directions.\n\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       A.     The Incident\n       On January 6, 2009 Chiaramonte was detained at the North County Correctional\nFacility, which the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department supervises. At\napproximately 5:00 p.m. another inmate observed Chiaramonte “on the floor, face up,”\nand not moving. A group of inmates picked up Chiaramonte and placed him back in his\nbunk, but Chiaramonte “began shaking violently [and] he fell out of the bunk [and] struck\nthe side of his head against the concrete floor.” Chiaramonte continued shaking, and\n“blood was oozing out of his mouth . . . .”\n       Nursing staff and sheriff’s deputies responded. Although how long it took the jail\nstaff to respond was disputed, at some point the nurses were able to bring Chiaramonte to\nthe infirmary, where the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital.\n\n\n       B.     The Lawsuit\n       In October 2009 Chiaramonte, through his guardian ad litem, filed this action\nagainst the County and various employees of the jail as Doe defendants. Chiaramonte\nasserted causes of action for (1) violation of his civil rights under 42 United States Code\nsection 1983 (section 1983); (2) assault and battery; (3) intentional infliction of emotional\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fdistress; and (4) violation of Government Code section 845.6.1 Chiaramonte alleged that\ndefendants violated his constitutional rights by “failing to provide protection . . . from\nassaults and or other conditions that would in all probability result in injury to persons in\na similar situation . . . or failing to provide medical services when there was knowledge\nor should been knowledge that immediate medical services were necessary.”\nChiaramonte also alleged that “once it was known that [he] sustained serious head\ninjuries, . . . [d]efendants with deliberate indifference failed to provide immediate\nmedical attention even though it was known that said medical care and treatment would\nbe necessary to prevent serious and permanent injuries.” Chiaramonte further alleged\nthat he “had obvious signs of physical trauma” but that defendants “failed to summon or\nprovide medical care to [Chiaramonte], who was in need of immediate medical care.”\nFinally, Chiaramonte alleged that defendants “had reason to know that the administration\nof medical and custodial care at [the] jail facility was such that as structured it could not\nrespond to inmates in the position of [Chiaramonte], who had immediate medical needs\ncaused by known serious and obvious medical conditions.”\n       The trial court sustained demurrers to the second cause of action for assault and\nbattery and the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nwithout leave to amend. The court also denied the County’s motion to strike the punitive\ndamages allegations. Neither Chiaramonte nor the County challenges these rulings.\n\n\n       C.     The County’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n       In July 2010 the County moved for summary judgment, or in the alternative,\nsummary adjudication. The County argued that it was immune from liability for\nChiaramonte’s section 1983 claim under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States\n\n\n1       Government Code section 845.6 provides that “[n]either a public entity nor a\npublic employee is liable for injury proximately caused by the failure of the employee to\nfurnish or obtain medical care for a prisoner in his custody . . . except . . . if the employee\nknows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need of immediate medical care and\nhe fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical care. . . .”\n\n\n                                               3\n\fConstitution because the county sheriff had final policymaking authority over the county\njails and acted as a state officer in setting and implementing jail policies and procedures.\nThe County also argued that it was not liable under Government Code section 845.6\nbecause Chiaramonte could not establish that the jail employees failed to summon\nimmediate medical care for Chiaramonte despite knowing or having reason to know that\nhe needed such care. The County submitted the declarations of Custody Assistant\nChristian Young, Nurse Patricia Kim, and Deputy Luis Torres, all of whom were working\nthe afternoon shift at North County Correctional Facility on January 6, 2009, as well as\nDr. Julian Wallace, acting Chief Physician of the Medical Services Bureau.2\n       In opposition to the motion, Chiaramonte argued that the County, not the state, is\nresponsible for providing medical care to the inmate population and that the sheriff does\nnot act as a state official in providing medical care to inmates. Chiaramonte argued that,\nalthough the county sheriff might be immune from section 1983 claims for law\nenforcement activities, the sheriff was not immune from section 1983 claims based on the\nprovision of medical care and prison safety, and that the sheriff “is a county official with\nregard to his responsibility to provide medical care to jail inmates.” Chiaramonte argued\nthat the delay in treatment violated his federal constitutional rights and his state rights\nunder Government Code section 845.6.\n       In November 2010 the trial court granted the County’s motion for summary\nadjudication on the first cause of action for violation of section 1983. The court ruled:\n“The County is not subject to suit for [Chiaramonte’s] claims because the Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff is protected by Eleventh Amendment immunity under the particular facts\nof the case. [¶] . . . [¶] . . . In this case, the Court finds that the functions being\nperformed by the Sheriff that are the basis of [Chiaramonte’s] claims (i.e., the alleged\n\n\n\n2      Young and Torres stated that they had no recollection of Chiaramonte or the\nJanuary 6, 2009 incident. Their declarations repeated statements contained in an Incident\nReport and an Inmate Injury Report. Chiaramonte did not object to the admission of\nthese statements submitted in support of the County’s motion for summary adjudication.\n\n\n                                                4\n\ffailure to provide protection and/or medical services to prisoners) are performed in the\ncontext of the Sheriff’s role as an official of the State of California, and not the County of\nLos Angeles. [Citations.] As a result, the Sheriff is immune from liability under . . .\n[s]ection 1983—as is the named Defendant, the County of Los Angeles. [Citations.]\n[¶] The Court recognizes that some federal courts have concluded in other cases that the\nSheriff is a ‘local policymaker’ when he performs certain activities relating to county\njails and jail inmates. [Citations.] The Court is however obligated to base its decision on\nwell-reasoned California precedent; and after much consideration and research, it\nconcludes in this case that the California decisions mentioned above are controlling.”\nThe court denied the County’s motion for summary adjudication on the fourth cause of\naction for violation of Government Code section 845.6, finding “that triable issues of\nmaterial fact exists as to when Custody Assistant Christian Young knew (or had reason to\nknow) that [Chiaramonte] was in need of medical care; and whether Young and the jail’s\nnursing staff thereafter took reasonable action to summon such medical care.”\n\n\n       D.     The Second Amended Complaint\n       In June 2011, after several rounds of and challenges to amended pleadings,\nChiaramonte filed a second amended complaint asserting causes of action for: (1) civil\nrights violations against Wallace, Cassim, Florentin, and Kim; (2) assault and battery\nagainst Doe defendants; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress against Doe\ndefendants; (4) violation of Government Code section 845.6 against the County, Cassim,\nFlorentin, and Kim; and (5) medical negligence against Cassim, Florentin, and Kim.\nChiaramonte alleged that, at the time of his medical emergency, Cassim was the medical\nofficer on duty and “the only medical doctor on duty . . . in the entire Los Angeles\nCounty Jail System,” and had the responsibility for “providing medical care and\ntreatment to up to 150 inmates in the Twin Towers Jail Facility Medical Clinic and\n[being] available for medical consultation and the provision of orders regarding [the] care\nand treatment to all other jail inmates in the Los Angeles County Jail System including\nbut not limited to in excess of three thousand inmates in the North County Correctional\n\n                                              5\n\fFacility.” Chiaramonte alleged that “Cassim knew that he could not provide appropriate\nmedical care to inmates who required medical treatment nor could he be available to\nprovide medical orders and treatment to inmates who had a need for and required\nimmediate medical treatment.” With respect to Wallace, Chiaramonte alleged that, “[a]s\nActing Chief Physician,” he “was personally responsible for supervising the professional\nmedical staff” at the jails, and “had responsibility for promulgating, amending, reviewing\nand approving the policies and procedures . . . relating to the provision of medical care to\ninmates in the Los Angeles County Jail System.” Chiaramonte claimed that Wallace had\ncreated “a system of medical care” that failed to provide adequate emergency care at the\njails, and allowed Cassim to serve as the medical officer of the day despite knowing that\nCassim had a history of ignoring patients with medical needs in the jails.\n       Chiaramonte alleged in his fourth cause of action that nurses Kim and Florentin\nknew he needed immediate medical care but “failed to take reasonable action to summon\nsuch care” and “failed to timely respond to notification that [Chiaramonte] was in need of\nmedical care . . . .” Chiaramonte also alleged that Cassim knew “he could not adequately\nrespond to calls from non-doctor medical personnel in the case of inmates who required\nimmediate medical attention at facilities other than where he was situated, and in all\nprobability inmates in [Chiaramonte’s] position . . . would sustain further injury through\nhis known inability to act and respond.” Finally, Chiaramonte alleged in his fifth cause\nof action for medical negligence that Kim and Florentin did not comply with the\napplicable standard of care “in diagnosing, treating and caring” for Chiaramonte, and that\nCassim breached his standard of care by “failing to either be available or not being timely\nin performing his duties as ‘Medical Officer of the Day’ in providing medical orders and\nadvice for health care staff at County Jail facilities where there would be no other\nmedical physician staff.”\n\n\n       E.     The Individual Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n       In February 2012 the individual defendants (Wallace, Cassim, Kim, and Florentin)\nmoved for summary judgment, or in the alternative for summary adjudication, on\n\n                                             6\n\fChiaramonte’s first, fourth and fifth causes of action, arguing that they were entitled to\nqualified immunity as government employees and that there was no evidence of\ndeliberate indifference to Chiaramonte’s medical needs.3 They also argued that\nChiaramonte’s claim for medical negligence was barred as untimely because\nChiaramonte had not filed his malpractice action in court within six months of the\nCounty’s notice of rejection of the claim.\n       In support of the motion, nurses Kim and Florentin submitted declarations\ndetailing their version of the chronology of events. Kim first explained that upon\nreceiving a call of “man down” indicating a medical emergency, “it is necessary to first\nobtain an emergency medical cart, obtain a gurney and gather an inmate trustee to assist\nwith pushing the gurney, before proceeding to the site of the call. Also, a deputy escort is\nrequired because of the use of [the] inmate trustee. In some cases, where there [is] only\none deputy in the clinic at the time of the call, that deputy will need to secure in a cell, all\nof the remaining inmates who are waiting to be seen in the clinic for medical care or\ntreatment.”\n       Kim stated that she received that “man down” call for Chiaramonte “at roughly\n4:50 p.m.,” and that Chiaramonte’s dorm “is roughly a five minute walk from the clinic.”\nWhen she arrived, she found Chiaramonte “on the floor on his left side, near his bunk,\nverbally non-responsive and combative,” with “blood coming from his mouth and his\nface was flush.” She “was unable to check his vital signs or oxygen status because of his\ncombative behavior,” but observed that he was moaning and “was non-responsive to\npainful stimuli.” According to Kim, at 5:03 p.m. she told the deputies to call the\nparamedics, and at approximately 5:05 p.m. Chiaramonte “was transferred to a gurney,\nwith the assistance of six deputies and he was brought to the clinic for further evaluation\nand care.” Florentin then applied an oxygen mask and an intravenous line. Kim then\nattempted to contact Cassim, the medical officer on duty, but was unable to reach him.\n\n\n3      Wallace moved for summary adjudication only on the first cause of action, the\nonly one in which he was named.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fThe paramedics arrived at 5:14 (according to the deputy clock) or 5:18 p.m. (according to\nthe clinic clock) and transported Chiaramonte to the hospital at 5:29 p.m.\n       The individual defendants also submitted the declaration of Dr. Nickolay\nTeophilov, Chief Physician of the Sheriff’s Department Medical Services Bureau, who\nstated he had reviewed the jail medical records. Dr. Teophilov stated that “[p]romptly\nupon assessing Mr. Chiaramonte in his housing module, the nurses recognized correctly\nthat his medical condition required treatment that could not be provided in the infirmary\nclinic and instructed custody staff to summon paramedics for the patient’s transport to the\nhospital for treatment. Mr. Chiaramonte was then transported to the infirmary clinic\nwhere further assessments were made. Mr. Chiaramonte was given oxygen and an\n[intravenous line] with normal saline was started. The treatment Mr. Chiaramonte\nreceived in the clinic was timely and appropriate.” He stated his opinion that “the\nnursing staff, in the care and treatment they provided to Mr. Chiaramonte, conformed\nwith the community standard of care,” and that they properly called the paramedics to\ntake Chiaramonte to the hospital.\n       In opposition to the motion, Chiaramonte argued that there were issues of material\nfact regarding the timing and extent of the medical care he received and whether the jail’s\nsystem of medical care violated his civil rights. Chiaramonte argued that section 1200 of\ntitle 15 of the California Code of Regulations required a jail to have at least one physician\navailable, Cassim was not available, and Wallace knew it. Chiaramonte also argued that\nthe individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because “the\nconstitutional right to adequate medical care while incarcerated is clearly established,”\nand that the malpractice claim was not untimely because the County had delayed in\nproducing Chiaramonte’s prison medical records.\n       On May 23, 2012 the court granted the individual defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. With respect to Chiaramonte’s first cause of action for civil rights\nviolations under section 1983, the court ruled that Chiaramonte had failed “to show that\ndefendants are not entitled to qualified immunity or show that [his] civil rights were\nviolated,” and that Chiaramonte had failed “to show that there was a denial of medical\n\n                                             8\n\fcare that is manifested by defendants’ deliberate indifference to [his] needs.” The court\nnoted that Kim and Florentin summoned the paramedics, and that, although Cassim did\nnot respond to Kim’s telephone calls, there was no evidence that he “deliberately\nabsented himself from the nurses to prevent any calls or deliberately did not take calls\nfrom the nurses.” In addition, there was no evidence that Wallace “was involved in the\nspecifics of this case.” The court also noted that Chiaramonte had cited to section 1200\nof title 15 of the California Code of Regulations, but had “not established what is meant\nby this statute, whether it means that the physician must be present for 24 hours a day and\nwhether the physician must be physically present.”\n       With respect to the fifth cause of action for medical malpractice, the court stated\nthat Chiaramonte had not submitted “an opposing physician declaration that disputes the\nconclusion of Dr. Teophilov that the care and treatment provided by the nursing staff to\n[Chiaramonte] conformed to the standard of care.” The court also found that\nChiaramonte had not submitted sufficient evidence of delayed discovery.4\n       Chiaramonte subsequently dismissed his remaining cause of action against the\nCounty for violation of Government Code section 845.6. The trial court entered\njudgment on July 3, 2012. Chiaramonte filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Chiaramonte argues that the trial court made three errors. First, the court\nerroneously granted summary adjudication in favor of the County on his section 1983\nclaim because the sheriff, in maintaining the jails and providing medical services to\ninmates, acts on behalf of the County, not the state, and therefore is not entitled to\n\n\n4      Chiaramonte conceded that the individual defendants were entitled to summary\nadjudication on his fourth cause of action for violation of Government Code\nsection 845.6. The second cause of action for assault and battery and the third cause of\naction for intentional infliction of emotion distress were against Doe defendants only, and\nwere not the subject of the summary judgment motion.\n\n\n                                              9\n\fEleventh Amendment immunity. Second, the trial court erroneously granted summary\nadjudication in favor of the individual defendants on his section 1983 claim because these\ndefendants are not entitled to qualified immunity. Finally, the trial court erroneously\ngranted summary adjudication in favor of Cassim, Florentin, and Kim because, contrary\nto the trial court’s ruling, the six-month deadline did not bar the claim and there were\ntriable issues of material fact regarding whether Cassim, Florentin, and Kim breached the\napplicable standards of care.\n\n\n       A. Standard of Review\n       “‘On appeal after a motion for summary judgment has been granted, we review the\nrecord de novo, considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition\npapers except that to which objections have been made and sustained. [Citation.]’\n[Citation.] A motion for summary judgment is properly granted ‘if all the papers\nsubmitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.’ [Citation.]” (Biancalana v. T.D.\nService Co. (2013) 56 Cal.4th 807, 813; see Rhea v. General Atomics (2014) 227\nCal.App.4th 1560, 1566, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Sep. 2, 2014.) “‘A\ndefendant moving for summary judgment has the burden of producing evidence showing\nthat one or more elements of the plaintiff’s cause of action cannot be established, or that\nthere is a complete defense to that cause of action. [Citations.] The burden then shifts to\nthe plaintiff to produce specific facts showing a triable issue as to the cause of action or\nthe defense. [Citations.] Despite the shifting burdens of production, the defendant, as the\nmoving party, always bears the ultimate burden of persuasion as to whether summary\njudgment is warranted. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Hypertouch, Inc. v. ValueClick, Inc.\n(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 805, 817.) “Appellate courts (1) take the facts from the record\nthat was before the superior court when it ruled on the motion; (2) consider all the\nevidence set forth in the moving and opposing papers, unless the superior court sustained\nobjections to that evidence; and (3) resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fthe party opposing the motion. [Citation.]” (Robinson v. City of Chowchilla (2011) 202\nCal.App.4th 368, 374.)\n\n\n       B.     The County Is Not Entitled to Summary Adjudication on Chiaramonte’s\n              Section 1983 Claim on the Ground of Eleventh Amendment Immunity\n       “Because the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution sets\nstandards of conduct for state and local governments, but does not provide for redress,\nindividuals whose federal rights are violated by a state or local official may seek the\nprotection of this statute, title 42 United States Code section 1983.”5 (Donovan v. Poway\nUnified School Dist. (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 567, 584, fn. 4.) Section 1983 “of the\nfederal Civil Rights Act, provides remedies for violations of federal rights committed by\npersons acting under color of state law.” (Shoemaker v. Harris (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th\n1210, 1219.) As the California Supreme Court has explained, “‘[l]ocal governing bodies\n. . . can be sued directly under [section] 1983 for monetary . . . relief where . . . the action\nthat is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement,\nordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body’s\nofficers.’ [Citation.] Section 1983 was enacted to provide compensation ‘to those\ndeprived of their federal rights by state actors,’ a category that includes cities and other\nlocal governments.” (Manta Management Corp. v. City of San Bernardino (2008) 43\nCal.4th 400, 406.)\n       States and state officers acting in their official capacity are absolutely immune\nunder the Eleventh Amendment from tort liability under section 1983. (See Buckhannon\nHome v. West Va. Dept. (2001) 532 U.S. 598, 609, fn. 10 [121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d\n\n\n5      Section 1983 provides in part: “Every person who, under color of any statute,\nordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory . . . , subjects, or causes\nto be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction\nthereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in\nequity, or other proper proceeding for redress . . . .”\n\n\n                                               11\n\f855]; Flint v. Dennison (9th Cir. 2007) 488 F.3d 816, 824-825; Bougere v. County of Los\nAngeles (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 237, 241-242.) “‘[S]tates and state officers sued in their\nofficial capacity are not considered “persons” for purposes of section 1983 and are\nimmune from liability under that statute by virtue of the Eleventh Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution and the doctrine of sovereign immunity. [Citation.]’\n[Citations.]” (Catsouras v. Department of California Highway Patrol (2010) 181\nCal.App.4th 856, 892.) Eleventh Amendment immunity, however, does not apply to\nlocal government and officials. (See Venegas v. County of Los Angeles (2004) 32 Cal.4th\n820, 829, italics omitted [“cities, counties and local officers sued in their official\ncapacity” are considered “‘persons’” under section 1983 and may be sued directly “for\nconstitutional violations carried out under their own regulations, policies, customs, or\nusages by persons having ‘final policymaking authority’”].) The determination of\nwhether the particular government official is acting as a policymaker for the state or for\nthe county is a matter of state law. (McMillian v. Monroe County (1997) 520 U.S. 781,\n786 [117 S.Ct. 1734, 138 L.Ed.2d 1]; see Pitts v. County of Kern (1998) 17 Cal.4th 340,\n352-353; County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (2009) 181 Cal.App.4th 218, 233-\n234.)\n        A number of California cases have addressed the issue whether a local government\nofficial is acting on behalf of the state or a county for purposes of Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity. In Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th 340 a group of plaintiffs whose\nconvictions for sex offenses against children had been reversed for prosecutorial\nmisconduct, and whose alleged victims recanted, sued the district attorney and other\ncounty officials involved in the prosecution. (Id. at pp. 345-346.) The plaintiffs claimed\n“civil rights violations based on alleged misconduct during the criminal prosecution.”\n(Id. at p. 346.) The California Supreme Court held that “a district attorney is a state\nofficial when preparing to prosecute and when prosecuting criminal violations of state\nlaw,” as well as when he or she is “training and developing policy in these areas.” (Id. at\npp. 360, 362.) The Supreme Court noted, however, that its “conclusion as to which entity\nthe district attorney represents might differ were plaintiffs challenging a district\n\n                                              12\n\fattorney’s alleged action or inaction related to hiring or firing an employee, workplace\nsafety conditions, procuring office equipment, or some other administrative function\narguably unrelated to the prosecution of state criminal law violations. Those\nconsiderations are not presented here.” (Id. at p. 363.)\n       In County of Los Angeles v. Superior Court (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 1166 (Peters)\nthe plaintiff alleged that after she “posted bail, the Sheriff of Los Angeles County and his\ndeputies nevertheless detained [her] in the Los Angeles County jail for an additional 10\ndays, in reliance on a warrant which they reasonably should have known did not relate to\nher.” (Id. at p. 1168.) The plaintiff sued the County of Los Angeles under section 1983,\nalleging that the sheriff had an “official policy of detaining, arresting, imprisoning,\nsearching and harassing persons based on warrants for the arrest of other people; of\nfailing to properly investigate claims of persons that they are not the person named in the\nwarrant; and of failing to properly train, supervise, control, and discipline officers to\nprevent violations of the rights of persons wrongly arrested.” (Peters, supra, at p. 1169.)\nThe court, applying McMillian and Pitts, held that “in establishing policies for the release\nof persons from a county jail, a sheriff acts as a state official, not a policymaker for the\ncounty.” (Peters, supra, at p. 1174.) The court noted that article V, section 13 of the\nCalifornia Constitution, and Government Code section 12560, gave the Attorney General\nsupervisory authority over the county sheriffs, and Government Code section 26605\nrequired the sheriff to “‘take charge of and . . . keep the county jail and the prisoners in\nit.’” (Peters, supra, at pp. 1174-1175.) The court stated that, in contrast, Government\nCode section 25303 prohibited the county board of supervisors from “obstruct[ing] the\ninvestigative function of the sheriff of the county . . . .” (Peters, supra, at p. 1175, italics\nomitted.) The court concluded that “the sheriff operates the jail pursuant to the sheriff’s\nconstitutional and statutory law enforcement powers, and not as a policymaker for the\nboard of supervisors, which has no direct control over the sheriff in this regard.” (Id. at\np. 1177.) The court emphasized that “[t]he function involved in this case is determining\nwhether to release a person who may be subject to arrest on an outstanding warrant. This\nis a law enforcement function.” (Ibid.)\n\n                                               13\n\f       In Venegas v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 32 Cal.4th 820, a husband and wife\nfiled an action under section 1983 against Los Angeles County and its sheriff’s\ndepartment for unreasonable search and seizure during a criminal investigation. The\ncounty and the sheriff’s department claimed “California sheriffs conducting criminal\ninvestigations are acting on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement\nactivities,” and that therefore, “as a state agent, the sheriff enjoys the state’s immunity\nfrom prosecution for the asserted violations of section 1983 . . . .” (Venegas, supra, at\np. 828.) The California Supreme Court “conclude[d] that, following the analysis\nprescribed in McMillian, Pitts and Peters, California sheriffs act as state officers while\nperforming state law enforcement duties such as investigating possible criminal activity.”\n(Id. at p. 839.)\n       And in Bougere v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th 237 the plaintiff\nwas an inmate in the county jail who claimed that the denial by jail employees of his\nrepeated requests for a transfer to another facility after he had received threats against his\nlife allowed other inmates to inflict injuries on him. (Id. at p. 240.) Applying Pitts,\nPeters, and Venegas, the court held that “[t]he sheriff’s duties to preserve the peace (Gov.\nCode, § 26600) and to ‘prevent and suppress any affrays, breaches of the peace, riots, and\ninsurrections’ (Gov. Code, § 26602) are law enforcement functions and do not lose this\nstatus simply because they are carried out within the confines of a jail, which the sheriff\nis charged with operating (Gov. Code, § 26605). Inmates at the county jail typically\nconsist of those persons who have been arrested for committing state crimes and are\nawaiting trial, persons who have already been sentenced, and those detained as witnesses\nor under civil process or contempt orders. We cannot find that a sheriff’s policies\nrelating to the safekeeping of such persons is merely an ‘administrative function arguably\nunrelated to the prosecution of state criminal law violations.’” (Bougere, supra, at\np. 247, quoting Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 363.) The court concluded\n“that in setting and implementing policies and procedures concerning the assignment of\ninmates in the county jail, the sheriff acts as a state officer performing state law\nenforcement duties, and not as a policymaker on behalf of the county,” and that therefore\n\n                                              14\n\fthe County was entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. (Bougere, supra,\nat pp. 247-248.)\n       Thus, California case law has made it clear that county sheriffs and their deputies\nact on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement activities, whether those\nactivities are performed out in the field or “within the confines of a jail.” (Bougere v.\nCounty of Los Angeles, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 247.) Similarly, sheriffs and their\ndeputies act on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement activities (Venegas\nv. County of Los Angeles, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 828), such as searching houses and cars\nand seizing evidence “when conducting a criminal investigation” (id. at p. 826). In the\ncontext of operating the jails, California sheriffs are acting on behalf of the state when\nimplementing policies regarding where and how to house inmates and when to release\nthem. (See Bougere, supra, at pp. 247-248; Peters, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1174.)\nAnd, although not directly relevant to the issue in this case, prosecutors act on behalf of\nthe state when they prosecute crimes and train other prosecutors to do so. (Pitts v.\nCounty of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 345, 362, 366.)\n       No California case, however, has held that the sheriff acts on behalf of the state in\nthe provision of medical care to inmates of the county jail. Unlike assigning inmates to\ncells or buildings in the jail, segregating them for security reasons, or determining\nwhether to release them, providing medical care to inmates does not necessarily involve a\nlaw enforcement function. (See Venegas v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 32 Cal.4th at\np. 834; Bougere v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 247; Peters,\nsupra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1175.) No case has held that everything the sheriff does in\noperating the jails qualifies as conduct on behalf of the state. To the contrary, the\ndetermination of whether a particular government official acts for the state or the county\n“‘does not require an “all-or-nothing” categorization applying to every type of conduct in\nwhich the official may engage. Rather, the issue is whether the official is a local\npolicymaker with regard to the particular action alleged to have deprived the plaintiff of\ncivil rights.’ [Citation.]” (Bougere, supra, at p. 242; accord, Peters, supra, at p. 1172;\nsee Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 353, italics added [under McMillian,\n\n                                             15\n\fwe resolve the issue of immunity by deciding “the question of which entity a government\nofficial represents when performing a certain function”].)6\n       Chiaramonte claims that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department performed\nthree particular functions or actions, pursuant to policies, that violated section 1983.\nChiaramonte alleges that the sheriff’s department (1) failed to respond promptly to a\nmedical emergency, (2) did not have a doctor or emergency medical care professional at\nor near the jail in which he was incarcerated, and (3) employed a (far away) “Medical\nOfficer of the Day” who had a history of abandoning and ignoring inmates who needed\nmedical attention. We agree with the County that the first claim, regarding the timeliness\nof the response to Chiaramonte’s medical condition, involves law enforcement activity\nsimilar to Bougere and Peters, because the County submitted evidence that the response\ntime is related to jail, inmate, and staff security. For example, Young, a custody assistant\non duty during Chiaramonte’s medical emergency, stated that he needs to “call for deputy\nback-up, before entering the dorm . . . for safety and security reasons,” and that he must\nwait until “sufficient custody personnel arrive[s]” before it is safe to enter the dorm. Kim\nstated that the jail must provide her with a security escort and also secure the infirmary\nbefore she can respond to a “man down” emergency in the dormitory. Deputy Torres,\nwho was working the evening shift, stated that if it is necessary to enter a cell containing\nother inmates to reach a “man down,” he must wait for back-up deputies to arrive before\nentering the cell “for safety and security reasons.” Thus, policies like the one in this case\nthat affect the time it takes to respond to a medical emergency unquestionably relate to\nlaw enforcement activities of the sheriff, and under Venegas, Bougere, and Peters\ngovernment officials implementing and executing those policies are entitled to immunity.\n       In contrast, Chiaramonte’s second claim, the decision whether and when to have a\ndoctor on the jail premises, does not involve the kind of law enforcement activities that\n\n\n6      Thus, although the County “strenuously maintain[s] the Sheriff acts on behalf of\nthe State in all aspect[s] of running the jails and the keeping of the prisoners therein,”\nCalifornia law is contrary to the County’s position.\n\n\n                                             16\n\fthe Venegas, Bougere, and Peters courts found were actions taken on behalf of the state.\nIn the “particular action” at issue in this case, the sheriff’s department was not\ninvestigating criminal activity (Venegas), assisting in the prosecution of crimes (Pitts),\nmaintaining security in the jail (Bougere), or ensuring the safety of the public (Peters).\nThe sheriff’s department was performing the administrative function of scheduling\ndoctors. The only evidence the County submitted in its motion for summary judgment of\nwhy there was no doctor at the jail when Chiaramonte required medical attention was the\nstatement by Dr. Julian Wallace, the Chief Physician of the Sheriff’s Department’s\nMedical Services Bureau, that the jail where Chiaramonte was incarcerated had doctors at\nthe facility clinic Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. but not after that.\nSuch a scheduling decision seems reasonable, but it is a scheduling decision, not a law\nenforcement one. Indeed, the scheduling of doctor shifts at the jail is closer to the\nemployment decision or “administrative function arguably unrelated to the prosecution of\nstate criminal law violations” that the Supreme Court in Pitts suggested was not an action\non behalf of the state. (Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 363.)7\n       The County asserts that “[t]here is no authority whatsoever for the County Board\nof Supervisors to dictate the policies within the jail regarding medical care, including\nstaffing of medical personnel, for the prisoners or to otherwise control the operation of\nthe jail in this regard.” Penal Code section 4015, subdivision (a), however, provides:\n“The board of supervisors shall provide the sheriff with necessary food, clothing, and\nbedding, for those prisoners, which shall be of a quality and quantity at least equal to the\nminimum standards and requirements prescribed by the Board of Corrections for the\nfeeding, clothing, and care of prisoners in all county, city and other local jails and\n\n\n7       Chiaramonte’s third claim, employment of a doctor who had a history of ignoring\nthe medical needs of inmates, also does not appear to implicate state law enforcement\nactivities. Chiaramonte, however, did not submit admissible evidence in support of this\nclaim in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court sustained the\nCounty’s evidentiary objections to the evidence relating to this claim, and Chiaramonte\nhas not challenged those rulings on appeal.\n\n\n                                              17\n\fdetention facilities.” Chiaramonte also cites to Government Code sections 29602 [“[t]he\nexpenses necessarily incurred in the support of persons charged with or convicted of a\ncrime and committed to the county jail . . . are county charges”] and 25351 [board of\nsupervisors has the power to construct, expand, and repair jails]. As the court recognized\nin Board of Supervisors v. Superior Court (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1724, Penal Code\nsection 4015, subdivision (a), and Government Code section 29602, as well as “other\nstatutes[,] establish the duty of the board of supervisors to provide the sheriff with\nnecessities for prisoners.” (Id. at p. 1738.)\n       Although this is a close case, the facts and circumstances here do not justify an\nextension of Eleventh Amendment immunity to all of Chiaramonte’s claims. Because on\nthis record at least one of Chiaramonte’s claims is not subject to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, the County was not entitled to summary adjudication of his cause of action\nunder section 1983. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1) [“[a] motion for summary\nadjudication shall be granted only if it completely disposes of a cause of action”]; Chavez\nv. Glock, Inc. (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1312 [although moving party is not entitled\nto summary adjudication on less than the entire cause of action, such a party is “not\nwithout procedural devices, including, for example, a motion in limine”]; McCaskey v.\nCalifornia State Automobile Assn. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 947, 975 [“there can be no\nsummary adjudication of less than an entire cause of action”].)\n\n\n       C.     The Individual Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment on\n              Chiaramonte’s Section 1983 Claim Based on Qualified Immunity\n       In Saucier v. Katz (2001) 533 U.S. 194 [121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272] the\nUnited States Supreme Court “established a two-step procedure for determining whether\na defendant’s conduct was entitled to qualified immunity. First, ‘[t]aken in the light most\nfavorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer’s conduct\nviolated a constitutional right?’ [Citation.] ‘If no constitutional right would have been\nviolated were the allegations established,’ then the qualified immunity inquiry ends.\n[Citation.] However, ‘if a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties’\n\n                                                18\n\fsubmissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\nThis inquiry, it is vital to note, must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the\ncase, not as a broad, general proposition . . . .’ [Citation.]” (Mendoza v. City of West\nCovina (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 702, 711, fn. omitted; see Tolan v. Cotton (2014) ___\nU.S. ___, ___ [134 S.Ct. 1861, 1865-1866, 188 L.Ed.2d 895].)8 “The issue of whether\nqualified immunity exists is ultimately one of law for the trial court. [Citation.] Disputes\nof historical fact relevant to the issue, however, must be decided by a jury.” (Wood v.\nEmmerson (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1515.)\n       Considering “the specific context” of this case (Saucier v. Katz, supra, 533 U.S.\nat p. 201), the evidence submitted in connection with the motion for summary judgment\ndoes not show that Wallace, Cassim, Florentin, or Kim violated Chiaramonte’s\nconstitutional rights. Chiaramonte’s claim is that the medical care he received violated\nthe Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because the individual defendants did not\nrespond in time and, in Wallace’s case, knew that they could not respond in time.\n       As Chiaramonte recognizes, in order for this conduct to constitute a constitutional\nviolation, it must amount to deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. “In\norder to prevail on an Eighth Amendment claim for inadequate medical care, a plaintiff\nmust show ‘deliberate indifference’ to his ‘serious medical needs.’ [Citation.] This\nincludes ‘both an objective standard—that the deprivation was serious enough to\nconstitute cruel and unusual punishment—and a subjective standard—deliberate\nindifference.’ [Citation.]” (Colwell v. Bannister (9th Cir. 2014) ___ F.3d ___, ___ [2014\nWL3953769 at p. 3]; see Estelle v. Gamble (1976) 429 U.S. 97, 104-105, fns. omitted [97\n\n\n\n8       In Pearson v. Callahan (2009) 555 U.S. 223 [129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565], the\nUnited States Supreme Court changed the order of the two-step procedure of Saucier\nfrom mandatory to discretionary, so that individual trial courts could “determine which\nprong of the inquiry should be tackled first.” (Mendoza v. City of West Covina, supra,\n206 Cal.App.4th at p. 711, fn. 9; see Tolan v. Cotton, supra, ___ U.S. at p. ___ [134 S.Ct.\nat p. 1866] [“[c]ourts have discretion to decide the order in which to engage these two\nprongs”].)\n\n\n                                              19\n\fS.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251] [“deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners\nconstitutes the ‘unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain’ [citation] proscribed by the\nEighth Amendment,” which includes “indifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in\ntheir response to the prisoner’s needs or by prison guards in intentionally denying or\ndelaying access to medical care or intentionally interfering with the treatment once\nprescribed”]; Peralta v. Dillard (9th Cir. 2014) 744 F.3d 1076, 1082 [“[a] prison official\nis deliberately indifferent to [a serious medical] need if he ‘knows of and disregards an\nexcessive risk to inmate health’”].) “[S]ubjective recklessness as used in the criminal law\nis . . . the test for ‘deliberate indifference’ under the Eighth Amendment.” (Farmer v.\nBrennan (1994) 511 U.S. 825, 839-840.)\n       Nothing in the evidence suggests that any of the individual defendants acted with\ndeliberate indifference to Chiaramonte’s medical needs. Nurses Kim and Florentin\nresponded responsibly and with alacrity to the challenging medical and security issues\nthat suddenly arose on January 6, 2009. Although there may have been some\ndiscrepancies regarding the precise minute each stage of the response occurred, the\nundisputed evidence is that the nurses were able to reach Chiaramonte, transport him to\nthe infirmary, begin providing treatment, call the paramedics, and get him to the hospital,\nall within a relatively short amount of time. Even if the timing of their actions were not\nperfect, no reasonable person could conclude from the evidence that they acted with\nintentional or reckless indifference to Chiaramonte’s medical needs.\n       As for doctors Wallace and Cassim, there is also no admissible evidence that they\nacted with deliberate indifference. Although there was evidence that Cassim was absent\nand, at least for some period of time, unreachable, that evidence did not support a\nconclusion that Cassim’s absence or unavailability was deliberate indifference.\nChiaramonte’s citation to section 1200 of title 15 of the California Code of Regulations,\neven if it says what he contends it says, is a reference to a “regulatory” right, not a\nconstitutional right. (See Ove v. Gwinn (9th Cir. 2001) 264 F.3d 817, 824 [“‘[t]o the\nextent that the violation of a state law amounts to the deprivation of a state-created\ninterest that reaches beyond that guaranteed by the federal Constitution, Section 1983\n\n                                              20\n\foffers no redress’”]; Anderson v. City (E.D.Cal. 2014) 2014 WL 2442592 at p. 3 [“[t]here\nis no independent claim under [section] 1983 for violation of prison regulations”];\nHutchison v. Marshall (C.D.Cal. 2011) 2011 WL 862118 at p. 10 [“[s]ection 1983\nprovides a cause of action only for violation of the United States Constitution and federal\nlaws and statutes”].)9\n       Therefore, because the evidence showed no violation of Chiaramonte’s\nconstitutional rights by Wallace, Cassim, Kim, or Florentin, they are entitled to qualified\nimmunity from Chiaramonte’s section 1983 claim against them. (See Jimenez v. County\nof Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 133, 144 [“qualified immunity applies only to\nindividuals . . . and not to municipalities”].)\n\n\n       D.     The Individual Defendants Are Entitled to Summary Judgment on\n              Chiaramonte’s Medical Malpractice Claim\n              1.      Chiaramonte’s Malpractice Claim Is Barred by Government Code\n                      Section 945.6\n       Government Code section 945.6, subdivision (a), provides, in pertinent part, that\n“any suit brought against a public entity on a cause of action for which a claim is required\nto be presented . . . must be commenced: [¶] (1) If written notice is given in accordance\nwith Section 913, not later than six months after the date such notice is personally\ndelivered or deposited in the mail.” Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, a\nperson with a claim against a public entity must “initiate a lawsuit against the public\nentity or public employee not later than six months after the date notice of the claim’s\nrejection was personally delivered to the person or deposited in the mail,” and [f]ailure to\ncomply with this six-month time limitation mandates dismissal of the lawsuit.” (Apollo\n\n\n9       Chiaramonte relies on Jensen v. Lane County (9th Cir. 2000) 222 F.3d 570, which\nheld that a physician who treated an inmate at a county health facility was not entitled to\nqualified immunity. The doctor in Jensen, however, was “a contract psychiatrist\naffiliated with a private group,” not a government employee. (Id. at p. 573.) All of the\nindividual defendants in this case were government employees.\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fv. Gyaami (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1486, fn. 14.) Government Code section 945.6\n“is a true statute of limitations defining the time in which, after a claim presented to the\ngovernment has been rejected or deemed rejected, the plaintiff must file a complaint\nalleging a cause of action based on the facts set out in the denied claim.” (Shirk v. Vista\nUnified School Dist. (2007) 42 Cal.4th 201, 209.)\n       The trial court found that Chiaramonte’s medical malpractice claim against the\nindividual defendants was untimely and that Chiaramonte had not met his burden of\nproving delayed discovery. Chiaramonte argues that the delay in filing was justified and\ndelayed accrual of his claim because the County “intentionally postponed production of\nany information concerning [Chiaramonte’s] medical care and the identities of those\nemployees” of the County who treated him. Chiaramonte asserts that he filed his\namended claim, which included a malpractice claim, within six months of the County’s\ndisclosure of the information.\n       The chronology does not support Chiaramonte’s argument. Chiaramonte filed his\ngovernment claim on May 6, 2009. By the time the County rejected his claim on October\n14, 2009, Chiaramonte had already filed his complaint in this action on October 8, 2009.\nAlthough Chiaramonte’s tort claim submitted to the County included a claim for medical\nmalpractice, his original complaint filed in this action did not. Under Government Code\nsection 945.6, Chiaramonte had six months from the denial of his claim, or until April 22,\n2010, to file a cause of action for medical practice. Chiaramonte did not attempt to bring\na medical malpractice claim until October 29, 2010, when he filed a motion for leave to\nfile a first amended complaint (which included a medical malpractice cause of action),\nlong after the six-month period had expired.10 Under Government Code section 950.2 a\ncause of action against a public employee acting within the course and scope of\nemployment is barred if the cause of action against the public entity is barred. (Del Real\nv. City of Riverside (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 761, 767; see C.A. Magistretti Co. v. Merced\n\n\n\n10     The trial court granted the motion on January 31, 2011.\n\n\n                                              22\n\fIrrigation Dist. (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 270, 274-275 [“‘[s]ection 950.2 applies to all\npublic employees’” and “‘makes it clear that when such an employee is sued for an act or\nomission in the scope of employment, said action is barred by the failure to present a\nclaim to the employing public entity,’” and “‘[t]his is true even where the public entity\nitself is immune from liability’”].) Therefore, Chiaramonte’s medical malpractice claim\nagainst the individual defendants was untimely because his medical malpractice claim\nagainst the County was untimely.11\n       Nor was there any basis for delaying accrual of the medical malpractice cause of\naction. “The government claims statutes do not contain a unique definition of accrual.\nRather, accrual of the cause of action for purposes of the claims statute is the date of\naccrual that would pertain under the statute of limitations applicable to a dispute between\nprivate litigants. [Citations.]” (K.J. v. Arcadia Unified School Dist. (2009) 172\nCal.App.4th 1229, 1238.) A medical malpractice claim “accrues and the statute of\nlimitations begins to run when the plaintiff has reason to suspect an injury and some\nwrongful cause, unless the plaintiff pleads and proves that a reasonable investigation at\nthat time would not have revealed a factual basis for that particular cause of action,” in\nwhich case “the statute of limitations for that cause of action will be tolled until such time\nas a reasonable investigation would have revealed its factual basis.” (Fox v. Ethicon\nEndo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 803.) Chiaramonte not only suspected in May\n2009 he had an injury caused by the medical negligence of the County and its employees,\nhe actually and timely submitted a tort claim to the County claiming medical malpractice.\n\n\n\n\n11      Chiaramonte did not argue in the trial court, and does not argue on appeal, that the\nmedical malpractice cause of action against Cassim, Kim, and Florentin related back to\nthe original complaint. (Cf. Roe v. County of Lake (N.D.Cal. 2000) 107 F.Supp.2d 1146,\n1154 [first amended complaint filed more than six months after notice of rejection of\ngovernment tort claim was not untimely under Government Code section 945.6 because\n“the original complaint details almost verbatim the same factual allegations that are found\nin the amended complaint”].)\n\n\n                                             23\n\fTherefore, his medical malpractice claim accrued no later than May 2009, and\nGovernment Code section 945.6 bars Chiaramonte’s claim.\n\n\n              2.     Chiaramonte’s Malpractice Claim Is Barred Because He Did Not\n                     Create a Triable Issue of Fact on the Standard of Care\n       Under Government Code section 845.6, “a public employee, and the public entity\nwhere the employee is acting within the scope of his employment, is liable if the\nemployee knows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need of immediate medical\ncare and he fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical care.” Nurses Kim\nand Florentine admittedly knew that Chiaramonte needed immediate medical care. They\nsubmitted the expert declaration of Dr. Teophilov, who gave his opinion, after reviewing\nthe medical records, that the nurses followed the proper procedures, summoned the\nparamedics, and “initiated all other appropriate life saving interventions . . . .” Dr.\nTeophilov opined that “the nursing staff, in the care and treatment they provided to Mr.\nChiaramonte, conformed with the community standard of care.” Dr. Teophilov stated\nthat “[t]here was no further treatment the nurses could have provided to Mr. Chiaramonte\nin the setting of an outpatient clinic,” and that the nurses “appropriately called the\nparamedics to transfer the patient to a hospital for further evaluation and treatment.” This\nevidence satisfied the individual defendants’ initial burden on summary judgment. (See\nAvivi v. Centro Medico Urgente Medical Center (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 463, 468\n[medical expert’s declaration that the defendants “acted reasonably and appropriately and\nthat [their] actions were within the community’s standard of care” was sufficient to shift\nburden on summary judgment to the plaintiff]; Zavala v. Arce (1997) 58 Cal.App.4th\n915, 934-935 [defendant in medical malpractice action met his initial “statutory burden of\nproof” on summary judgment by submitted declaration of medical expert on standard of\ncare].) Chiaramonte in his opening brief does not argue otherwise.12\n\n\n\n12      Chiaramonte argues in his reply brief that the individual defendants did not meet\ntheir initial burden on summary adjudication because Dr. Teophilov’s declaration lacked\n\n                                              24\n\f       Chiaramonte argues that “there are questions of material fact that precluded\nsummary judgment on the cause of action for medical negligence.” In opposition to the\nmotion, however, Chiaramonte did not submit a declaration from an expert that could\ncreate a triable issue of fact. Therefore, the individual defendants were entitled to\njudgment on Chiaramonte’s medical malpractice claim as a matter of law. (See Powell v.\nKleinman (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 112, 123 [“‘“[w]hen a defendant [in a medical\nmalpractice case] moves for summary judgment and supports his motion with expert\ndeclarations that his conduct fell within the community standard of care, he is entitled to\nsummary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert\nevidence”’”]; Selden v. Dinner (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 166, 173 [“a medical standard of\ncare can only be established by way of expert medical testimony”]; Munro v. Regents of\nUniversity of California (1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 977, 984 [because plaintiffs “failed to\nsubmit the declaration of an expert in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,”\nthere was no triable issue of fact “regarding defendants’ compliance with the relevant\nmedical standard of care”].)\n\n\n\n\nfoundation. Chiaramonte points to Dr. Teophilov’s deposition testimony that his\nopinions regarding Chiaramonte’s medical condition and diagnosis “would be all\nspeculation” because he had not seen all of Chiaramonte’s medical records. By raising\nthis argument for the first time on reply, however, Chiaramonte has forfeited it. (See\nVarjabedian v. City of Madera (1977) 20 Cal.3d 285, 295, fn. 11; Holmes v. Petrovich\nDevelopment Co., LLC (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 1047, 1064, fn. 2.) On the merits, Dr.\nTeophilov did provide foundation for his opinions, including identifying the medical\nrecords and testimony he reviewed, and he explained the bases for his opinions. Because\nhis opinion concerned the actions and timing of the nurses in responding to the “man\ndown” call, he did not need to know or have an opinion about the specifics of\nChiaramonte’s medical condition. Indeed, he was evaluating the conduct of the nurses in\nresponding to the emergency without knowing what Chiaramonte’s precise medical\ncondition was, and in getting Chiaramonte to a facility where he could receive\nappropriate diagnostic treatment.\n\n\n                                             25\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n\n\n       The judgment is reversed as to the County. The trial court is directed to vacate its\nNovember 2010 order granting the County’s motion for summary adjudication on\nChiaramonte’s first cause of action for violation of his civil rights under section 1983 and\nto enter a different order denying the motion. In all other respects, the judgment is\naffirmed. The parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                 SEGAL, J.*\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n              WOODS, Acting P.

Haniffa Cassim, and nurses Rosendo Florentin and Patricia Kim,\nafter the trial court granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment. We reverse\nthe judgment in favor of the County, affirm the judgment in favor of Wallace, Cassim,\nFlorentin, and Kim, and remand with directions.\n\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n       A.     The Incident\n       On January 6, 2009 Chiaramonte was detained at the North County Correctional\nFacility, which the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department supervises. At\napproximately 5:00 p.m. another inmate observed Chiaramonte “on the floor, face up,”\nand not moving. A group of inmates picked up Chiaramonte and placed him back in his\nbunk, but Chiaramonte “began shaking violently [and] he fell out of the bunk [and] struck\nthe side of his head against the concrete floor.” Chiaramonte continued shaking, and\n“blood was oozing out of his mouth . . . .”\n       Nursing staff and sheriff’s deputies responded. Although how long it took the jail\nstaff to respond was disputed, at some point the nurses were able to bring Chiaramonte to\nthe infirmary, where the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital.\n\n\n       B.     The Lawsuit\n       In October 2009 Chiaramonte, through his guardian ad litem, filed this action\nagainst the County and various employees of the jail as Doe defendants. Chiaramonte\nasserted causes of action for (1) violation of his civil rights under 42 United States Code\nsection 1983 (section 1983); (2) assault and battery; (3) intentional infliction of emotional\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fdistress; and (4) violation of Government Code section 845.6.1 Chiaramonte alleged that\ndefendants violated his constitutional rights by “failing to provide protection . . . from\nassaults and or other conditions that would in all probability result in injury to persons in\na similar situation . . . or failing to provide medical services when there was knowledge\nor should been knowledge that immediate medical services were necessary.”\nChiaramonte also alleged that “once it was known that [he] sustained serious head\ninjuries, . . . [d]efendants with deliberate indifference failed to provide immediate\nmedical attention even though it was known that said medical care and treatment would\nbe necessary to prevent serious and permanent injuries.” Chiaramonte further alleged\nthat he “had obvious signs of physical trauma” but that defendants “failed to summon or\nprovide medical care to [Chiaramonte], who was in need of immediate medical care.”\nFinally, Chiaramonte alleged that defendants “had reason to know that the administration\nof medical and custodial care at [the] jail facility was such that as structured it could not\nrespond to inmates in the position of [Chiaramonte], who had immediate medical needs\ncaused by known serious and obvious medical conditions.”\n       The trial court sustained demurrers to the second cause of action for assault and\nbattery and the third cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress\nwithout leave to amend. The court also denied the County’s motion to strike the punitive\ndamages allegations. Neither Chiaramonte nor the County challenges these rulings.\n\n\n       C.     The County’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n       In July 2010 the County moved for summary judgment, or in the alternative,\nsummary adjudication. The County argued that it was immune from liability for\nChiaramonte’s section 1983 claim under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States\n\n\n1       Government Code section 845.6 provides that “[n]either a public entity nor a\npublic employee is liable for injury proximately caused by the failure of the employee to\nfurnish or obtain medical care for a prisoner in his custody . . . except . . . if the employee\nknows or has reason to know that the prisoner is in need of immediate medical care and\nhe fails to take reasonable action to summon such medical care. . . .”\n\n\n                                               3\n\fConstitution because the county sheriff had final policymaking authority over the county\njails and acted as a state officer in setting and implementing jail policies and procedures.\nThe County also argued that it was not liable under Government Code section 845.6\nbecause Chiaramonte could not establish that the jail employees failed to summon\nimmediate medical care for Chiaramonte despite knowing or having reason to know that\nhe needed such care. The County submitted the declarations of Custody Assistant\nChristian Young, Nurse Patricia Kim, and Deputy Luis Torres, all of whom were working\nthe afternoon shift at North County Correctional Facility on January 6, 2009, as well as\nDr. Julian Wallace, acting Chief Physician of the Medical Services Bureau.2\n       In opposition to the motion, Chiaramonte argued that the County, not the state, is\nresponsible for providing medical care to the inmate population and that the sheriff does\nnot act as a state official in providing medical care to inmates. Chiaramonte argued that,\nalthough the county sheriff might be immune from section 1983 claims for law\nenforcement activities, the sheriff was not immune from section 1983 claims based on the\nprovision of medical care and prison safety, and that the sheriff “is a county official with\nregard to his responsibility to provide medical care to jail inmates.” Chiaramonte argued\nthat the delay in treatment violated his federal constitutional rights and his state rights\nunder Government Code section 845.6.\n       In November 2010 the trial court granted the County’s motion for summary\nadjudication on the first cause of action for violation of section 1983. The court ruled:\n“The County is not subject to suit for [Chiaramonte’s] claims because the Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff is protected by Eleventh Amendment immunity under the particular facts\nof the case. [¶] . . . [¶] . . . In this case, the Court finds that the functions being\nperformed by the Sheriff that are the basis of [Chiaramonte’s] claims (i.e., the alleged\n\n\n\n2      Young and Torres stated that they had no recollection of Chiaramonte or the\nJanuary 6, 2009 incident. Their declarations repeated statements contained in an Incident\nReport and an Inmate Injury Report. Chiaramonte did not object to the admission of\nthese statements submitted in support of the County’s motion for summary adjudication.\n\n\n                                                4\n\ffailure to provide protection and/or medical services to prisoners) are performed in the\ncontext of the Sheriff’s role as an official of the State of California, and not the County of\nLos Angeles. [Citations.] As a result, the Sheriff is immune from liability under . . .\n[s]ection 1983—as is the named Defendant, the County of Los Angeles. [Citations.]\n[¶] The Court recognizes that some federal courts have concluded in other cases that the\nSheriff is a ‘local policymaker’ when he performs certain activities relating to county\njails and jail inmates. [Citations.] The Court is however obligated to base its decision on\nwell-reasoned California precedent; and after much consideration and research, it\nconcludes in this case that the California decisions mentioned above are controlling.”\nThe court denied the County’s motion for summary adjudication on the fourth cause of\naction for violation of Government Code section 845.6, finding “that triable issues of\nmaterial fact exists as to when Custody Assistant Christian Young knew (or had reason to\nknow) that [Chiaramonte] was in need of medical care; and whether Young and the jail’s\nnursing staff thereafter took reasonable action to summon such medical care.”\n\n\n       D.     The Second Amended Complaint\n       In June 2011, after several rounds of and challenges to amended pleadings,\nChiaramonte filed a second amended complaint asserting causes of action for: (1) civil\nrights violations against Wallace, Cassim, Florentin, and Kim; (2) assault and battery\nagainst Doe defendants; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress against Doe\ndefendants; (4) violation of Government Code section 845.6 against the County, Cassim,\nFlorentin, and Kim; and (5) medical negligence against Cassim, Florentin, and Kim.\nChiaramonte alleged that, at the time of his medical emergency, Cassim was the medical\nofficer on duty and “the only medical doctor on duty . . . in the entire Los Angeles\nCounty Jail System,” and had the responsibility for “providing medical care and\ntreatment to up to 150 inmates in the Twin Towers Jail Facility Medical Clinic and\n[being] available for medical consultation and the provision of orders regarding [the] care\nand treatment to all other jail inmates in the Los Angeles County Jail System including\nbut not limited to in excess of three thousand inmates in the North County Correctional\n\n                                              5\n\fFacility.” Chiaramonte alleged that “Cassim knew that he could not provide appropriate\nmedical care to inmates who required medical treatment nor could he be available to\nprovide medical orders and treatment to inmates who had a need for and required\nimmediate medical treatment.” With respect to Wallace, Chiaramonte alleged that, “[a]s\nActing Chief Physician,” he “was personally responsible for supervising the professional\nmedical staff” at the jails, and “had responsibility for promulgating, amending, reviewing\nand approving the policies and procedures . . . relating to the provision of medical care to\ninmates in the Los Angeles County Jail System.” Chiaramonte claimed that Wallace had\ncreated “a system of medical care” that failed to provide adequate emergency care at the\njails, and allowed Cassim to serve as the medical officer of the day despite knowing that\nCassim had a history of ignoring patients with medical needs in the jails.\n       Chiaramonte alleged in his fourth cause of action that nurses Kim and Florentin\nknew he needed immediate medical care but “failed to take reasonable action to summon\nsuch care” and “failed to timely respond to notification that [Chiaramonte] was in need of\nmedical care . . . .” Chiaramonte also alleged that Cassim knew “he could not adequately\nrespond to calls from non-doctor medical personnel in the case of inmates who required\nimmediate medical attention at facilities other than where he was situated, and in all\nprobability inmates in [Chiaramonte’s] position . . . would sustain further injury through\nhis known inability to act and respond.” Finally, Chiaramonte alleged in his fifth cause\nof action for medical negligence that Kim and Florentin did not comply with the\napplicable standard of care “in diagnosing, treating and caring” for Chiaramonte, and that\nCassim breached his standard of care by “failing to either be available or not being timely\nin performing his duties as ‘Medical Officer of the Day’ in providing medical orders and\nadvice for health care staff at County Jail facilities where there would be no other\nmedical physician staff.”\n\n\n       E.     The Individual Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n       In February 2012 the individual defendants (Wallace, Cassim, Kim, and Florentin)\nmoved for summary judgment, or in the alternative for summary adjudication, on\n\n                                             6\n\fChiaramonte’s first, fourth and fifth causes of action, arguing that they were entitled to\nqualified immunity as government employees and that there was no evidence of\ndeliberate indifference to Chiaramonte’s medical needs.3 They also argued that\nChiaramonte’s claim for medical negligence was barred as untimely because\nChiaramonte had not filed his malpractice action in court within six months of the\nCounty’s notice of rejection of the claim.\n       In support of the motion, nurses Kim and Florentin submitted declarations\ndetailing their version of the chronology of events. Kim first explained that upon\nreceiving a call of “man down” indicating a medical emergency, “it is necessary to first\nobtain an emergency medical cart, obtain a gurney and gather an inmate trustee to assist\nwith pushing the gurney, before proceeding to the site of the call. Also, a deputy escort is\nrequired because of the use of [the] inmate trustee. In some cases, where there [is] only\none deputy in the clinic at the time of the call, that deputy will need to secure in a cell, all\nof the remaining inmates who are waiting to be seen in the clinic for medical care or\ntreatment.”\n       Kim stated that she received that “man down” call for Chiaramonte “at roughly\n4:50 p.m.,” and that Chiaramonte’s dorm “is roughly a five minute walk from the clinic.”\nWhen she arrived, she found Chiaramonte “on the floor on his left side, near his bunk,\nverbally non-responsive and combative,” with “blood coming from his mouth and his\nface was flush.” She “was unable to check his vital signs or oxygen status because of his\ncombative behavior,” but observed that he was moaning and “was non-responsive to\npainful stimuli.” According to Kim, at 5:03 p.m. she told the deputies to call the\nparamedics, and at approximately 5:05 p.m. Chiaramonte “was transferred to a gurney,\nwith the assistance of six deputies and he was brought to the clinic for further evaluation\nand care.” Florentin then applied an oxygen mask and an intravenous line. Kim then\nattempted to contact Cassim, the medical officer on duty, but was unable to reach him.\n\n\n3      Wallace moved for summary adjudication only on the first cause of action, the\nonly one in which he was named.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fThe paramedics arrived at 5:14 (according to the deputy clock) or 5:18 p.m. (according to\nthe clinic clock) and transported Chiaramonte to the hospital at 5:29 p.m.\n       The individual defendants also submitted the declaration of Dr. Nickolay\nTeophilov, Chief Physician of the Sheriff’s Department Medical Services Bureau, who\nstated he had reviewed the jail medical records. Dr. Teophilov stated that “[p]romptly\nupon assessing Mr. Chiaramonte in his housing module, the nurses recognized correctly\nthat his medical condition required treatment that could not be provided in the infirmary\nclinic and instructed custody staff to summon paramedics for the patient’s transport to the\nhospital for treatment. Mr. Chiaramonte was then transported to the infirmary clinic\nwhere further assessments were made. Mr. Chiaramonte was given oxygen and an\n[intravenous line] with normal saline was started. The treatment Mr. Chiaramonte\nreceived in the clinic was timely and appropriate.” He stated his opinion that “the\nnursing staff, in the care and treatment they provided to Mr. Chiaramonte, conformed\nwith the community standard of care,” and that they properly called the paramedics to\ntake Chiaramonte to the hospital.\n       In opposition to the motion, Chiaramonte argued that there were issues of material\nfact regarding the timing and extent of the medical care he received and whether the jail’s\nsystem of medical care violated his civil rights. Chiaramonte argued that section 1200 of\ntitle 15 of the California Code of Regulations required a jail to have at least one physician\navailable, Cassim was not available, and Wallace knew it. Chiaramonte also argued that\nthe individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because “the\nconstitutional right to adequate medical care while incarcerated is clearly established,”\nand that the malpractice claim was not untimely because the County had delayed in\nproducing Chiaramonte’s prison medical records.\n       On May 23, 2012 the court granted the individual defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. With respect to Chiaramonte’s first cause of action for civil rights\nviolations under section 1983, the court ruled that Chiaramonte had failed “to show that\ndefendants are not entitled to qualified immunity or show that [his] civil rights were\nviolated,” and that Chiaramonte had failed “to show that there was a denial of medical\n\n                                             8\n\fcare that is manifested by defendants’ deliberate indifference to [his] needs.” The court\nnoted that Kim and Florentin summoned the paramedics, and that, although Cassim did\nnot respond to Kim’s telephone calls, there was no evidence that he “deliberately\nabsented himself from the nurses to prevent any calls or deliberately did not take calls\nfrom the nurses.” In addition, there was no evidence that Wallace “was involved in the\nspecifics of this case.” The court also noted that Chiaramonte had cited to section 1200\nof title 15 of the California Code of Regulations, but had “not established what is meant\nby this statute, whether it means that the physician must be present for 24 hours a day and\nwhether the physician must be physically present.”\n       With respect to the fifth cause of action for medical malpractice, the court stated\nthat Chiaramonte had not submitted “an opposing physician declaration that disputes the\nconclusion of Dr. Teophilov that the care and treatment provided by the nursing staff to\n[Chiaramonte] conformed to the standard of care.” The court also found that\nChiaramonte had not submitted sufficient evidence of delayed discovery.4\n       Chiaramonte subsequently dismissed his remaining cause of action against the\nCounty for violation of Government Code section 845.6. The trial court entered\njudgment on July 3, 2012. Chiaramonte filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n\n       Chiaramonte argues that the trial court made three errors. First, the court\nerroneously granted summary adjudication in favor of the County on his section 1983\nclaim because the sheriff, in maintaining the jails and providing medical services to\ninmates, acts on behalf of the County, not the state, and therefore is not entitled to\n\n\n4      Chiaramonte conceded that the individual defendants were entitled to summary\nadjudication on his fourth cause of action for violation of Government Code\nsection 845.6.

(Id. at pp. 345-346.) The plaintiffs claimed\n“civil rights violations based on alleged misconduct during the criminal prosecution.”\n(Id. at p. 346.) The California Supreme Court held that “a district attorney is a state\nofficial when preparing to prosecute and when prosecuting criminal violations of state\nlaw,” as well as when he or she is “training and developing policy in these areas.” (Id. at\npp. 360, 362.) The Supreme Court noted, however, that its “conclusion as to which entity\nthe district attorney represents might differ were plaintiffs challenging a district\n\n                                              12\n\fattorney’s alleged action or inaction related to hiring or firing an employee, workplace\nsafety conditions, procuring office equipment, or some other administrative function\narguably unrelated to the prosecution of state criminal law violations.

The plaintiff sued the County of Los Angeles under section 1983,\nalleging that the sheriff had an “official policy of detaining, arresting, imprisoning,\nsearching and harassing persons based on warrants for the arrest of other people; of\nfailing to properly investigate claims of persons that they are not the person named in the\nwarrant; and of failing to properly train, supervise, control, and discipline officers to\nprevent violations of the rights of persons wrongly arrested.” (Peters, supra, at p. 1169.)\nThe court, applying McMillian and Pitts, held that “in establishing policies for the release\nof persons from a county jail, a sheriff acts as a state official, not a policymaker for the\ncounty.” (Peters, supra, at p. 1174.) The court noted that article V, section 13 of the\nCalifornia Constitution, and Government Code section 12560, gave the Attorney General\nsupervisory authority over the county sheriffs, and Government Code section 26605\nrequired the sheriff to “‘take charge of and . . . keep the county jail and the prisoners in\nit.’” (Peters, supra, at pp. 1174-1175.) The court stated that, in contrast, Government\nCode section 25303 prohibited the county board of supervisors from “obstruct[ing] the\ninvestigative function of the sheriff of the county . . . .” (Peters, supra, at p. 1175, italics\nomitted.) The court concluded that “the sheriff operates the jail pursuant to the sheriff’s\nconstitutional and statutory law enforcement powers, and not as a policymaker for the\nboard of supervisors, which has no direct control over the sheriff in this regard.” (Id. at\np. 1177.) The court emphasized that “[t]he function involved in this case is determining\nwhether to release a person who may be subject to arrest on an outstanding warrant. This\nis a law enforcement function.” (Ibid.)\n\n                                               13\n\f       In Venegas v.

The\ncounty and the sheriff’s department claimed “California sheriffs conducting criminal\ninvestigations are acting on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement\nactivities,” and that therefore, “as a state agent, the sheriff enjoys the state’s immunity\nfrom prosecution for the asserted violations of section 1983 . . . .” (Venegas, supra, at\np. 828.) The California Supreme Court “conclude[d] that, following the analysis\nprescribed in McMillian, Pitts and Peters, California sheriffs act as state officers while\nperforming state law enforcement duties such as investigating possible criminal activity.”\n(Id. at p. 839.)\n       And in Bougere v. County of Los Angeles, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255771\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255771/bougere-v-county-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> the plaintiff\nwas an inmate in the county jail who claimed that the denial by jail employees of his\nrepeated requests for a transfer to another facility after he had received threats against his\nlife allowed other inmates to inflict injuries on him. (Id. at p. 240.) Applying Pitts,\nPeters, and Venegas, the court held that “[t]he sheriff’s duties to preserve the peace (Gov.\nCode, § 26600) and to ‘prevent and suppress any affrays, breaches of the peace, riots, and\ninsurrections’ (Gov. Code, § 26602) are law enforcement functions and do not lose this\nstatus simply because they are carried out within the confines of a jail, which the sheriff\nis charged with operating (Gov. Code, § 26605). Inmates at the county jail typically\nconsist of those persons who have been arrested for committing state crimes and are\nawaiting trial, persons who have already been sentenced, and those detained as witnesses\nor under civil process or contempt orders. We cannot find that a sheriff’s policies\nrelating to the safekeeping of such persons is merely an ‘administrative function arguably\nunrelated to the prosecution of state criminal law violations.’” (Bougere, supra, at\np. 247, quoting Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 363.) The court concluded\n“that in setting and implementing policies and procedures concerning the assignment of\ninmates in the county jail, the sheriff acts as a state officer performing state law\nenforcement duties, and not as a policymaker on behalf of the county,” and that therefore\n\n                                              14\n\fthe County was entitled to immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. (Bougere, supra,\nat pp. 247-248.)\n       Thus, California case law has made it clear that county sheriffs and their deputies\nact on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement activities, whether those\nactivities are performed out in the field or “within the confines of a jail.” (Bougere v.\nCounty of Los Angeles, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 247.) Similarly, sheriffs and their\ndeputies act on behalf of the state when performing law enforcement activities (Venegas\nv. County of Los Angeles, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 828), such as searching houses and cars\nand seizing evidence “when conducting a criminal investigation” (id. at p. 826). In the\ncontext of operating the jails, California sheriffs are acting on behalf of the state when\nimplementing policies regarding where and how to house inmates and when to release\nthem. (See Bougere, supra, at pp. 247-248; Peters, supra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1174.)\nAnd, although not directly relevant to the issue in this case, prosecutors act on behalf of\nthe state when they prosecute crimes and train other prosecutors to do so. (Pitts v.\nCounty of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 345, 362, 366.)\n       No California case, however, has held that the sheriff acts on behalf of the state in\nthe provision of medical care to inmates of the county jail. Unlike assigning inmates to\ncells or buildings in the jail, segregating them for security reasons, or determining\nwhether to release them, providing medical care to inmates does not necessarily involve a\nlaw enforcement function. (See Venegas v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 32 Cal.4th at\np. 834; Bougere v. County of Los Angeles, supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at p. 247; Peters,\nsupra, 68 Cal.App.4th at p. 1175.) No case has held that everything the sheriff does in\noperating the jails qualifies as conduct on behalf of the state. To the contrary, the\ndetermination of whether a particular government official acts for the state or the county\n“‘does not require an “all-or-nothing” categorization applying to every type of conduct in\nwhich the official may engage. Rather, the issue is whether the official is a local\npolicymaker with regard to the particular action alleged to have deprived the plaintiff of\ncivil rights.’ [Citation.]” (Bougere, supra, at p. 242; accord, Peters, supra, at p. 1172;\nsee Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 353, italics added [under McMillian,\n\n                                             15\n\fwe resolve the issue of immunity by deciding “the question of which entity a government\nofficial represents when performing a certain function”].)6\n       Chiaramonte claims that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department performed\nthree particular functions or actions, pursuant to policies, that violated section 1983.\nChiaramonte alleges that the sheriff’s department (1) failed to respond promptly to a\nmedical emergency, (2) did not have a doctor or emergency medical care professional at\nor near the jail in which he was incarcerated, and (3) employed a (far away) “Medical\nOfficer of the Day” who had a history of abandoning and ignoring inmates who needed\nmedical attention. We agree with the County that the first claim, regarding the timeliness\nof the response to Chiaramonte’s medical condition, involves law enforcement activity\nsimilar to Bougere and Peters, because the County submitted evidence that the response\ntime is related to jail, inmate, and staff security. For example, Young, a custody assistant\non duty during Chiaramonte’s medical emergency, stated that he needs to “call for deputy\nback-up, before entering the dorm . . . for safety and security reasons,” and that he must\nwait until “sufficient custody personnel arrive[s]” before it is safe to enter the dorm. Kim\nstated that the jail must provide her with a security escort and also secure the infirmary\nbefore she can respond to a “man down” emergency in the dormitory. Deputy Torres,\nwho was working the evening shift, stated that if it is necessary to enter a cell containing\nother inmates to reach a “man down,” he must wait for back-up deputies to arrive before\nentering the cell “for safety and security reasons.” Thus, policies like the one in this case\nthat affect the time it takes to respond to a medical emergency unquestionably relate to\nlaw enforcement activities of the sheriff, and under Venegas, Bougere, and Peters\ngovernment officials implementing and executing those policies are entitled to immunity.\n       In contrast, Chiaramonte’s second claim, the decision whether and when to have a\ndoctor on the jail premises, does not involve the kind of law enforcement activities that\n\n\n6      Thus, although the County “strenuously maintain[s] the Sheriff acts on behalf of\nthe State in all aspect[s] of running the jails and the keeping of the prisoners therein,”\nCalifornia law is contrary to the County’s position.\n\n\n                                             16\n\fthe Venegas, Bougere, and Peters courts found were actions taken on behalf of the state.\nIn the “particular action” at issue in this case, the sheriff’s department was not\ninvestigating criminal activity (Venegas), assisting in the prosecution of crimes (Pitts),\nmaintaining security in the jail (Bougere), or ensuring the safety of the public (Peters).\nThe sheriff’s department was performing the administrative function of scheduling\ndoctors. The only evidence the County submitted in its motion for summary judgment of\nwhy there was no doctor at the jail when Chiaramonte required medical attention was the\nstatement by Dr. Julian Wallace, the Chief Physician of the Sheriff’s Department’s\nMedical Services Bureau, that the jail where Chiaramonte was incarcerated had doctors at\nthe facility clinic Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. but not after that.\nSuch a scheduling decision seems reasonable, but it is a scheduling decision, not a law\nenforcement one. Indeed, the scheduling of doctor shifts at the jail is closer to the\nemployment decision or “administrative function arguably unrelated to the prosecution of\nstate criminal law violations” that the Supreme Court in Pitts suggested was not an action\non behalf of the state. (Pitts v. County of Kern, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 363.)7\n       The County asserts that “[t]here is no authority whatsoever for the County Board\nof Supervisors to dictate the policies within the jail regarding medical care, including\nstaffing of medical personnel, for the prisoners or to otherwise control the operation of\nthe jail in this regard.” Penal Code section 4015, subdivision (a), however, provides:\n“The board of supervisors shall provide the sheriff with necessary food, clothing, and\nbedding, for those prisoners, which shall be of a quality and quantity at least equal to the\nminimum standards and requirements prescribed by the Board of Corrections for the\nfeeding, clothing, and care of prisoners in all county, city and other local jails and\n\n\n7       Chiaramonte’s third claim, employment of a doctor who had a history of ignoring\nthe medical needs of inmates, also does not appear to implicate state law enforcement\nactivities. Chiaramonte, however, did not submit admissible evidence in support of this\nclaim in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The trial court sustained the\nCounty’s evidentiary objections to the evidence relating to this claim, and Chiaramonte\nhas not challenged those rulings on appeal.\n\n\n                                              17\n\fdetention facilities.” Chiaramonte also cites to Government Code sections 29602 [“[t]he\nexpenses necessarily incurred in the support of persons charged with or convicted of a\ncrime and committed to the county jail . . . are county charges”] and 25351 [board of\nsupervisors has the power to construct, expand, and repair jails].

Because on\nthis record at least one of Chiaramonte’s claims is not subject to Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, the County was not entitled to summary adjudication of his cause of action\nunder section 1983.

Chiaramonte argues that the delay in filing was justified and\ndelayed accrual of his claim because the County “intentionally postponed production of\nany information concerning [Chiaramonte’s] medical care and the identities of those\nemployees” of the County who treated him. Chiaramonte asserts that he filed his\namended claim, which included a malpractice claim, within six months of the County’s\ndisclosure of the information.\n       The chronology does not support Chiaramonte’s argument. Chiaramonte filed his\ngovernment claim on May 6, 2009. By the time the County rejected his claim on October\n14, 2009, Chiaramonte had already filed his complaint in this action on October 8, 2009.\nAlthough Chiaramonte’s tort claim submitted to the County included a claim for medical\nmalpractice, his original complaint filed in this action did not. Under Government Code\nsection 945.6, Chiaramonte had six months from the denial of his claim, or until April 22,\n2010, to file a cause of action for medical practice. Chiaramonte did not attempt to bring\na medical malpractice claim until October 29, 2010, when he filed a motion for leave to\nfile a first amended complaint (which included a medical malpractice cause of action),\nlong after the six-month period had expired.10 Under Government Code section 950.2 a\ncause of action against a public employee acting within the course and scope of\nemployment is barred if the cause of action against the public entity is barred.
