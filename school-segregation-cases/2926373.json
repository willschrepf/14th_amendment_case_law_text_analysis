Appellant Teresa Corral-Lerma filed suit against Border Demolition & Environmental,\n\nInc. (“Border Demolition”) and Raul and Bonnie Solis (“the Solises”) 1 after the defendants razed\n\na residential structure on her land and purportedly absconded with personal property without her\n\nauthorization. Border Demolition moved for hybrid summary judgment, contending inter alia\n\nthat her husband Eduardo Lerma authorized the demolition on her behalf as her agent. 2 The trial\n\n1\n For brevity’s sake, we will refer to the Appellees collectively as “Border Demolition” unless circumstances require\nus to make a distinction among them.\n2\n    In a separate trial, Border Demolition obtained a jury verdict holding Eduardo Lerma personally liable for\n\fcourt granted summary judgment in favor of Border Demolition on all claims and awarded more\n\nthan $75,000 in attorneys’ fees at a subsequent trial.\n\n        Appellant seeks reversal and reinstatement of her claims, arguing that numerous genuine\n\nissues of material fact precluded summary judgment. She also urges us to vacate the attorneys’\n\nfee award on waiver and sufficiency grounds. We affirm the trial court’s summary judgment in\n\npart, reverse it in part, and remand for trial on Appellant’s trespass claim. We also suggest a\n\nremittitur of attorney’s fees.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n                                            Factual History\n\n        Corral-Lerma appeals the trial court’s granting of Border Demolition’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment and as such, we review only the evidence properly contained within the\n\nsummary judgment record at the time of rendition. In 2008, the City of El Paso condemned and\n\nthreatened to demolish a residential structure located at 7429 Rose Lane Circle (“the Property”).\n\nAppellant purports to be the sole owner of the property, and two deeds in the record indicate that\n\nher husband, Eduardo Lerma, attempted to convey his undivided one-half interest in the\n\nProperty—then indisputably held as community property—during the mid-to-late 1980s\n\nAppellant admitted that she never truly wanted the house on the Property to be demolished and\n\nstated that she was still pursuing an appeal of the City of El Paso’s order at the time her husband\n\nsolicited demolition bids.       Her husband Eduardo, an attorney, acted as her attorney by\n\nrepresenting her in the condemnation proceedings before the City.\n\n        Eventually, Eduardo Lerma contacted Border Demolition, owned by the Solises, and\n\nsolicited a bid for demolition work for the Property. Border Demolition sent Lerma a proposed\n\ndemolition costs on oral contract and equitable grounds. We affirmed that judgment on appeal. See Lerma v.\nBorder Demolition & Envtl., Inc., No. 08-12-00105-CV, 2015 WL 737989 (Tex.App.--El Paso Feb. 20, 2015, no\npet. h.)(not yet published).\n\n                                                    2\n\fcontract, which he then forwarded to Appellant. Appellant testified in her deposition that her\n\nhusband only collected the bid; they agreed she would close and decide final terms of the\n\ndemolition contract for herself. She also denied ever authorizing Border Demolition to perform\n\nthe demolition work as stated in the proposed contract. Instead, she stated she contacted Border\n\nDemolition to inform them of her objections to the contract and to set up a meeting to further\n\ndiscuss terms. The evidence is undisputed that neither Appellant nor her husband ever signed the\n\nproposed contract. However, Eduardo Lerma did make representations in a letter to the City of\n\nEl Paso that he had personally hired Border Demolition to perform the demolition work during\n\nthe condemnation appeal.\n\n         In July 2008, Border Demolition’s sub-contractor, M&F Trucking, demolished the\n\nresidential structure on the Property. Border Demolition did not possess a key to the property at\n\nthe time of demolition and tore down the front gate to enter the property.                          Later, Border\n\nDemolition sued Eduardo Lerma for breach of contract. See Lerma, 2015 WL 737989, at *1\n\n(affirming judgment on appeal). Appellant Teresa Corral-Lerma subsequently filed this separate\n\nsuit against Border Demolition and the Solises.\n\n                                               Procedural History\n\n         In her live petition, Appellant purported to bring eight separate causes of action against\n\nBorder Demolition and the Solises: intrusion on seclusion, tortious interference, negligent\n\nmisrepresentation, fraudulent misrepresentation, fraud,3 private nuisance, conversion, negligent\n\ntrespass, intentional trespass, and civil theft under the Texas Theft Liability Act, TEX.CIV.PRAC.\n\n\n\n3\n  Although Appellant pleaded fraudulent misrepresentation and fraud as separate causes of action, fraudulent\nmisrepresentation is actually subsumed as an element of fraud. See Haase v. Glazner, 62 S.W.3d 795, 798 (Tex.\n2001)(“[P]roof that a party relied to its detriment on an alleged misrepresentation is an essential element of a fraud\nclaim.”); Lexington Ins. Co. v. Chubb & Sons, Inc., No. 3:09-cv-00561-B, 2009 WL 1940485, at *4 (N.D.Tex. July\n6, 2009)(not designated for publication)(“Under Texas law, common-law fraud and misrepresentation are the same\ncause of action.”).\n\n                                                          3\n\f& REM.CODE ANN. § 134.003(a)(West 2011).                        The defendants raised a counterclaim for\n\nattorney’s fees under the Texas Theft Liability Act.\n\n         Border Demolition and the Solises moved for hybrid summary judgment, challenging\n\nmultiple elements of each of the first seven causes of action on no-evidence grounds before\n\narguing traditional grounds in the alternative. The defendants later supplemented their hybrid\n\nsummary judgment motion to include the civil theft claim.\n\n         The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Border Demolition and the Solises\n\non all claims, but it did not specify upon which grounds its judgment rested. Appellant filed a\n\nnotice of appeal. We abated the appeal pending entry of judgment after trial.4\n\n         At trial, the jury awarded Border Demolition and the Solises $78,001 in attorneys’ fees.\n\nAppellant took appeal from that judgment as well. We consolidated these two actions into the\n\nsingle case at bar. Following extended mandamus proceedings5 interrupted by an automatic\n\nbankruptcy stay, the Texas Supreme Court granted Appellant’s mandamus relief and lifted its\n\nstay on this Court. We address the merits of this appeal below.\n\n                                                  DISCUSSION\n\n         In six issues, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment as\n\nto her claims for intentional and negligent trespass, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation,\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the appeal pre-trial, contending that Appellant was attempting to seek improper\ninterlocutory review of the summary judgment order by filing her notice of appeal because the issue of attorney’s\nfees had subsequently been litigated at trial. In an order dated June 1, 2011, we agreed that Appellant’s filing of the\nnotice of appeal was premature and impermissibly interlocutory, given that the issue of attorney’s fees had been set\nfor trial at the time. Nevertheless, because trial had already concluded, and given that the trial court would not enter\na final judgment on the verdict due to pendency of this appeal, we abated the appeal to allow for entry of final\njudgment so that we could treat the premature NOA as subsuming both trial and summary judgment issues.\n5\n See Corral-Lerma v. Border Demolition & Envtl., Inc., 420 S.W.3d 59 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, no pet.), mand.\ngranted, In re Corral-Lerma, 451 S.W.3d 385, 388 (Tex. 2014)(orig. proceeding).\n\n\n                                                           4\n\fconversion, and civil theft because preclusive fact issues exist for each claim.6 She also raises a\n\nform objection to Border Demolition’s no-evidence points in the trial court below. Finally,\n\nAppellant challenges the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees, contending that Appellees waived\n\ntheir right to claim fees by failing to raise the issue at summary judgment, or, alternatively, that\n\nAppellees’ failure to segregate recoverable fees from non-recoverable fees at trial was fatal.\n\n        Appellees counter that we should affirm summary judgment as to four causes of action\n\nbecause Appellant failed to properly assign error. Appellees further maintain that summary\n\njudgment as to the remaining claim was proper under either traditional or no-evidence review.\n\nThe Solises separately argue that Appellant waived any objection to the judgment rendered in\n\ntheir favor because she only argued her case with respect to Border Demolition and never\n\nactually raised legal arguments directed at them in her brief. Finally, Appellees collectively\n\ncontend they did not waive their claim to attorney’s fees and that the trial court committed no\n\nreversible error in awarding fees.\n\n        We begin by jointly addressing the procedural objections and summary judgment points\n\nbefore moving on to the attorney’s fees analysis.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                Standard of Review: Summary Judgment\n\n        We review summary judgment grants de novo. Merriman v. XTO Energy, Inc., 407\n\nS.W.3d 244, 248 (Tex. 2013). When a party moves for hybrid summary judgment, we generally\n\naddress the no-evidence grounds first before turning, if necessary, to the traditional grounds. Id.\n\n        “A no-evidence summary judgment motion under Rule 166a(i) is essentially a motion for\n\na pretrial directed verdict; it requires the nonmoving party to present evidence raising a genuine\n\n6\n  Because Appellant did not challenge the propriety of summary judgment as to her claims for intrusion to seclusion,\ntortious interference, or private nuisance, we affirm the trial court’s summary judgment order as to those four\nclaims.\n\n                                                         5\n\fissue of material fact supporting each element contested in the motion.” Timpte Indus., Inc. v.\n\nGish, 286 S.W.3d 306, 310 (Tex. 2009). “When reviewing a no-evidence summary judgment,\n\nwe review the evidence presented by the motion and response in the light most favorable to the\n\nparty against whom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable to that\n\nparty if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors\n\ncould not.”   Id. [Internal quotations marks omitted].      General or conclusory no-evidence\n\nchallenges are prohibited; a movant must identify specific elements on which the non-movant\n\nfailed to provide evidence. Id.\n\n       On traditional summary judgment review, we determine whether the movant has\n\nestablished that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that he is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law. TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(c). If so, the movant is entitled to summary judgment. Id.\n\n                                               A.\n\n                                         Proper Parties\n\n       As a threshold matter, the Solises contend that on appeal, Appellant never directly\n\nchallenged the propriety of the judgment rendered in their favor. Instead, they maintain that\n\nAppellant only raised arguments challenging the judgment with respect to Border Demolition.\n\nAs such, Appellant waived any claims against the Solises. We agree.\n\n       An appellant’s brief “must contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions\n\nmade, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.” TEX.R.APP.P. 38.1(i). Where\n\na case contains multiple appellees and an appellant only raises legal argument as to certain\n\nappellees and not others, the Court may properly affirm judgment as to the omitted appellees\n\nbecause the appellant has presented nothing for our review. See Deleon v. DSD Dev., Inc., No.\n\n01-03-00806-CV, 2006 WL 2506743, at *11 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 31, 2006, pet.\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fdenied)(mem. op.).\n\n       Here, Appellant never made any legal arguments challenging the propriety of the\n\njudgment with respect to Bonnie or Raul Solis. Indeed, Bonnie Solis is only mentioned in\n\npassing in the statement of facts section of Appellant’s brief, but never in the body of the brief.\n\nHer position in the controversy is never made clear, nor does Appellant put forth any argument\n\nas to her liability on appeal. As such, Appellant waived any claims against Bonnie Solis. As for\n\nthe portions of Appellant’s brief dealing with Raul Solis, he correctly notes that Appellant\n\nframes her legal argument entirely in terms of Border Demolition, mentioning Raul Solis only as\n\na party at Border Demolition with whom she had contact. She never explicitly argues why the\n\njudgment as to Raul Solis was improper. Even under the liberal construction rules, we can see\n\nno substantive legal argument presented that would allow us to review the propriety of the\n\njudgment with respect to Raul Solis. Appellant’s challenge to the summary judgment with\n\nrespect to the Solises is waived, and we affirm summary judgment as to Raul and Bonnie Solis.\n\n                                                B.\n\n                                      Assignment of Error\n\n       As another preliminary matter, Border Demolition argues that injury is an element of\n\nthree causes of action that it challenged in its motion before the trial court—namely, fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, conversion, and civil theft. Because Appellant failed to make any appellate\n\nargument as to injury in addressing these causes of action, Border Demolition maintains that we\n\nshould affirm summary judgment as to those claims.\n\n       An appellant’s precision in crafting an argument that attacks all possible grounds for the\n\ntrial court’s judgment is critical to avoid appellate waiver. “When there are multiple grounds for\n\nsummary judgment and the order does not specify the ground on which the summary judgment\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fwas rendered, the appealing party must negate all grounds on appeal.” Moore v. City of Wylie,\n\n319 S.W.3d 778, 781 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2010, no pet.). “If summary judgment could have been\n\nrendered, properly or improperly, on a ground not challenged, the judgment must be affirmed.”\n\nId. at 782.\n\n        With respect to Issue Two on fraudulent misrepresentation, Appellees’ arguments are\n\nmisplaced. On page 27 of her brief, Appellant explicitly states “Mrs. Lerma incurred injury as a\n\nresult because her real property was demolished.” Error was properly assigned, and we review\n\nthe merits of Issue Two below.\n\n        As for Issue Three, the claim for conversion, Appellant alleged in her brief that Border\n\nDemolition removed and exercised dominion over certain property from the home during the\n\ndemolition process. In construing Appellant’s brief under the liberal construction standards, we\n\nfind that is enough to assign error to the issue of injury or damages and review the merits of\n\nIssue Three.\n\n        In Issue Four, dealing with civil theft, Appellant’s no-evidence argument focuses on\n\nrebutting Border Demolition’s effective consent point.       Here, Appellant never explicitly\n\naddresses the injury issue raised in Border Demolition’s motion. Because that element was\n\nspecifically challenged in the motion for summary judgment, and because Appellant failed to\n\naddress that element on appeal, we must affirm the summary judgment as to the civil theft claim.\n\n        Issue Four is overruled.\n\n                                                 C.\n\n                                   Adequacy of No-Evidence Motion\n\n        Appellant also raises a threshold procedural point, arguing that Border Demolition’s no-\n\nevidence points on her claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and conversion must fail because\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fthey do not specify which elements of those claims are under attack. Specifically, Appellant\n\ncontends that by saying she showed “no evidence of various elements” on those claims, Border\n\nDemolition waived its ability to test those claims on no-evidence review.\n\n       Appellant misconstrues the language in Border Demolition’s no-evidence points and\n\nreads it out of context. Appellant is correct that if Border Demolition had lodged only general\n\nno-evidence objections in its motion for summary judgment, the motion would be defective and\n\nsummary judgment on those grounds would fail. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(i). Appellant is also\n\ncorrect that Border Demolition made prefatory comments that Appellant failed to provide\n\nevidence on “various elements” in certain portions of its motion. However, Border Demolition\n\nset out all the elements to each of those claims in the no-evidence portion of its summary\n\njudgment, then specifically identified which individual elements it was challenging. That is\n\nsufficient to raise those points under Rule 166a(i). Border Demolition’s no-evidence points were\n\nnot waived.\n\n                                                 D.\n\n                                  Summary Judgment by Claim\n\n       Having dealt with both parties’ procedural objections, we next turn our attention to the\n\nsurviving claims, addressing each one in turn under the no-evidence and, where necessary, the\n\ntraditional standard.\n\n                                                  1.\n\n                               Intentional and Negligent Trespass\n\n       In Issue One, Appellant contends the trial court’s summary judgment on her intentional\n\nand negligent trespass claims was error. “To recover damages for trespass to real property, a\n\nplaintiff must prove that (1) the plaintiff owns or has a lawful right to possess real property[;] (2)\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fthe defendant entered the plaintiff’s land and the entry was physical, intentional, and voluntary[;]\n\nand (3) the defendant’s trespass caused injury to the plaintiff.” Wilen v. Falkenstein, 191 S.W.3d\n\n791, 798 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied).\n\n                                        a. No-Evidence Review\n\n       Border Demolition raised two no-evidence points related to both intentional and\n\nnegligent trespass in its appellate brief. First, Border Demolition contended that Appellant\n\nprovided no evidence of compensable damages to the land in form of lost market value, loss of\n\nuse, or otherwise because according to her own estimates, the value of the property went up once\n\ndemolition occurred. Second, Border Demolition asserted that Appellant put forth no evidence\n\nto support a claim for mental anguish or similar damages. Appellant correctly notes that she\n\nnever requested mental anguish damages in her live pleadings when summary judgment was\n\nrendered. Thus, we entertain only Border Demolition’s no-evidence point on property damage.\n\n       Appellant maintains that she did not need to raise more than a scintilla of evidence on the\n\nissue of injury because injury and nominal damages are presumed in trespass cases. We agree.\n\n“[T]respass against a possessory interest . . . does not require actual injury to be actionable and\n\nmay result in an award of nominal damages.” Hill v. Crowson, No. 10-09-00006-CV, 2009 WL\n\n3858065, at *3 (Tex.App.--Waco Nov. 18, 2009, no pet.)(mem. op.)(citing Coastal Oil & Gas\n\nCorp. v. Garza Energy Trust, 268 S.W.3d 1, 12 n.36 (Tex. 2008)). “Even if a plaintiff fails to\n\nplead or prove that the defendant did any injury by entering plaintiff’s property, the plaintiff is\n\nstill entitled to nominal damages.” Gen. Mills Rest., Inc. v. Texas Wings, Inc., 12 S.W.3d 827,\n\n833 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2000, no pet.).\n\n       Even if Appellant were required to raise more than a scintilla of evidence to be entitled to\n\nthe nominal damages presumption, she more than met that burden by showing Border\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fDemolition tore down the front gates and demolished the house on the property. See Braxton v.\n\nChin Tuo Chen, No. 06–10–00134–CV, 2011 WL 4031171, at *11 (Tex.App.--Texarkana Sept.\n\n13, 2011, pet. denied)(mem. op.)(reversing summary judgment based on appellant’s claim that\n\nneighbor had pushed dirt over property line, which created material fact issue on injury and\n\nnominal damages).      Border Demolition’s argument on this issue is without merit, and\n\nAppellant’s trespass claim survives no-evidence review.\n\n                             b. Traditional Summary Judgment Review\n\n       We next turn to Border Demolition’s traditional grounds and its consent defense. Border\n\nDemolition advances a two-pronged consent argument in defense of summary judgment on this\n\nclaim. See Gen. Mills Rests., Inc., 12 S.W.3d at 835 (consent is a defense to trespass).\n\n       First, Border Demolition contends that Teresa Corral-Lerma was not the sole owner of\n\nthe Property.   Although Eduardo Lerma purportedly conveyed his community interest to\n\nAppellant in the 1980s to grant her the Property as her separate property, Border Demolition\n\nmaintains the conveyance was actually null and void.           As such, the Property remained\n\ncommunity property, and Eduardo Lerma, as co-owner, could consent to entry. In response,\n\nAppellant points to two deeds—a quitclaim deed from 1986 and a subsequent special warranty\n\ndeed from 1989 in which Eduardo Lerma purports to convey his one-half undivided interest in\n\nthe Property to Appellant. Border Demolition points to no contravening documentary evidence\n\nand cites no legal authority explaining why these deeds were defective. As such, based on the\n\nrecord before us, Border Demolition’s contention that Eduardo Lerma retained a legal interest in\n\nthe Property sufficient to grant him consent authority is only conjecture. At best, Eduardo\n\nLerma’s representation to third parties that he owned the Property raises a fact issue on\n\nownership that would preclude summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       Second, Border Demolition argues that even if Eduardo Lerma had no separate authority\n\nto consent to any entries, Appellant granted him the actual authority to enter into a transaction\n\nwith Border Demolition as her agent, or, at the very least, that she allowed Eduardo Lerma to\n\ncloak himself in her apparent authority and did nothing to correct Border Demolition’s\n\nreasonable reliance on his representations. Appellant maintains she only gave her husband\n\nauthority to solicit bids for the demolition, but she retained authority to ultimately decide who\n\nwould demolish the structures and on what terms. She also points to her own deposition\n\ntestimony, in which she claims to have called and spoken with Solis about her objections to the\n\ncontract, as proof that Border Demolition should have known the scope of Eduardo Lerma’s\n\nagency was limited.\n\n       “An agent is a person who is authorized by another to transact business or manage some\n\naffair by that person’s authority and on account of it.” Crooks v. M1 Real Estate Partners, Ltd.,\n\n238 S.W.3d 474, 483 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2007, pet. denied). The law does not presume agency;\n\nthe existence of an agency relationship must be established by evidence. Suarez v. Jordan, 35\n\nS.W.3d 268, 272 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.). Agents may act on behalf of\n\ntheir principals under one of two types of authority: actual or apparent. Id. at 273. “Actual\n\nauthority denotes that authority which the principal intentionally confers upon the agent, or\n\nintentionally allows the agent to believe he has, or by want of ordinary care allows the agent to\n\nbelieve himself to possess.” Id. Subsumed within actual authority are the concepts of express\n\nand implied authority. “An agent has express authority when the principal makes it clear to the\n\nagent that it wants certain acts to be done.” Crooks, 238 S.W.3d at 483. “Implied authority is\n\nthe authority to do whatever is reasonably necessary and proper to carry out the agent’s express\n\npowers.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f       “Apparent authority arises through acts of participation, knowledge, or acquiescence by\n\nthe principal that clothe the agent with the indicia of apparent authority.” Ins. Co. of N. Am. v.\n\nMorris, 981 S.W.2d 667, 672 (Tex. 1998). “One seeking to charge a principal through the\n\napparent authority of its agent must establish conduct by the principal that would lead a\n\nreasonably prudent person to believe that the agent has the authority that it purports to exercise.”\n\nNationsBank, N.A. v. Dilling, 922 S.W.2d 950, 953 (Tex. 1996). “A court may consider only the\n\nconduct of the principal leading a third party to believe that the agent has authority in\n\ndetermining whether an agent has apparent authority.” Id.\n\n       Appellant denies that she gave Eduardo Lerma actual authority to fully consummate a\n\ntransaction in her name. Instead, she claims that she only gave him the authority to solicit bids\n\nfor her review. Border Demolition argues that the summary judgment evidence established, as a\n\nmatter of law, that it had a reasonable belief that Eduardo Lerma acted with apparent authority\n\nbecause he held himself out as the owner of the house. Regardless of how many times Eduardo\n\nLerma told people he was the owner of the house, his representations alone do not bind\n\nAppellant to any consent he gave. “Only the conduct of the principal may be considered;\n\nrepresentations made by the agent of his authority have no effect.” Suarez, 35 S.W.3d at 273.\n\nTo the extent Border Demolition maintains that Eduardo Lerma’s representations are proof that\n\nAppellant acquiesced to his agency and that it was justified in believing Eduardo Lerma had\n\napparent authority, the facts on this point are disputed. Appellant testified in deposition that she\n\ncalled Border Demolition’s employees, informed them prior to demolition that she wanted to\n\ndiscuss the contract, and that Solis told her he would call her back to address her concerns. This\n\ncreates a fact question as to whether Border Demolition reasonably believed Eduardo Lerma was\n\nthe ultimate decision maker acting with his wife’s authority.\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f       In short, there are disputed issues of material fact concerning Eduardo Lerma’s ability to\n\nconsent to Border Demolition’s entry onto the property, either in his own right or as his wife’s\n\nagent. As such, Border Demolition cannot defeat Appellant’s trespass claim as a matter of law,\n\nand summary judgment on this point was improper.\n\n       Issue One is sustained.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n                         Fraudulent and Negligent Misrepresentation\n\n       In Issue Two, Appellant maintains that we should reverse summary judgment on her\n\nnegligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation claims.           We disagree.      The\n\nelements of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation are:\n\n       1. defendant made a representation to the plaintiff in the course of\n       defendant’s business or in a transaction in which the defendant had an\n       interest;\n\n       2. defendant supplied false information for the guidance of others;\n\n       3. defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining\n       or communicating the information;\n\n       4. plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation;\n\n       5. defendant’s negligent misrepresentation proximately caused the\n       plaintiff’s injury.\n\n       Miller v. LandAmerica Lawyers Title of El Paso, 362 S.W.3d 842, 845 (Tex.App.--El\n\nPaso 2012, no pet.).\n\n       Border Demolition challenged elements two, four, and five of Appellant’s negligent\n\nmisrepresentation claim in the no-evidence portion of its motion for summary judgment, but\n\nprovided no responsive briefing at the appellate level on these points, instead relying solely on its\n\nunmeritorious assignment of error defense. We must nevertheless review the merits of the\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fsummary judgment here. We agree that Appellant provided no evidence that Border Demolition\n\nprovided her with false information intended for her guidance as set out in the challenge to\n\nelement two, and uphold summary judgment on that ground.                “The ‘false information’\n\ncontemplated in a negligent misrepresentation case is a misstatement of existing fact, not a\n\npromise of future conduct.” Roof Sys., Inc. v. Johns Manville Corp., 130 S.W.3d 430, 439\n\n(Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.). “A promise to act or not to act in the future\n\ncannot form the basis of a negligent misrepresentation claim.”         Id.   Here, the nucleus of\n\nAppellant’s negligent misrepresentation claim is that Border Demolition promised not to act in\n\nthe future, i.e., it would refrain from demolishing the house. That future promise falls squarely\n\noutside the scope of what is cognizable as a negligent misrepresentation claim. As such, the trial\n\ncourt properly rendered summary judgment on that claim.\n\n       We also find that summary judgment on Appellant’s fraudulent misrepresentation claim\n\nwas proper. The elements of fraud are as follows:\n\n       (1) that a material representation was made;\n\n       (2) the representation was false;\n\n       (3) when the representation was made, the speaker knew it was false or made it recklessly\n       without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion;\n\n       (4) the speaker made the representation with the intent that the other party should act\n       upon it;\n\n       (5) the party acted in reliance on the representation; and\n\n       (6) the party thereby suffered injury.\n\n       Salazar v. Ramos, 361 S.W.3d 739, 749 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2012, pet. denied).\n\n       Border Demolition challenged elements one, three, four, five, and six in the no-evidence\n\nportion of its summary judgment motion. We agree that there was no evidence Appellant acted\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fin reliance on that information to her detriment. Indeed, Appellant disputes the very fact that she\n\nentered into a transaction with Border Demolition, maintaining that her position was always that\n\nshe would not consent to demolition until they reached a final agreement. However, “[w]ithout a\n\nbinding agreement, there is no detrimental reliance, and thus no fraudulent inducement claim.”\n\nHaase, 62 S.W.3d at 798. Appellant never directly explains, and we cannot independently see,\n\nhow her “reliance” on Border Demolition’s assurances that it would not demolish the home until\n\na final agreement was reached fits within fraud’s elemental framework. Border Demolition may\n\nhave acted without her direct permission, but there is no evidence that it induced her into\n\nconsummating a transaction or otherwise acting in reliance on its purportedly fraudulent\n\nrepresentations. See id. Absent proof of her reliance on Border Demolition’s word, summary\n\njudgment on Appellant’s fraud claim will stand.\n\n   Issue Two is overruled.\n\n                                                3.\n\n                                           Conversion\n\n       In Issue Three, Appellant contends the trial court erred by granting summary judgment\n\nagainst her conversion claims. Again, Border Demolition declined to file a responsive argument\n\nto Appellant’s contentions in its brief, relying solely on the assignment of error point we\n\noverruled above. We proceed without the benefit of Appellees’ argument.\n\n       “To establish a claim for conversion, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the plaintiff owned or\n\nhad possession of the property or entitlement to possession; (2) the defendant unlawfully and\n\nwithout authorization assumed and exercised control over the property to the exclusion of, or\n\ninconsistent with, the plaintiff’s rights as an owner; (3) the plaintiff demanded return of the\n\nproperty; and (4) the defendant refused to return the property.” Burns v. Rochon, 190 S.W.3d\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\f263, 268 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.).\n\n       Texas does not recognize conversion claims for real property. See Lucio v. John G. &\n\nMarie Stella Kenedy Mem’l Found., 298 S.W.3d 663, 672 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 2009, pet.\n\ndenied).   As such, Appellant’s conversion claim necessarily fails if she accuses Border\n\nDemolition of taking realty and not personalty. Whether personal property attached to realty\n\nretains its character as personal property depends on whether the property is an improvement or a\n\nfixture. Gorman v. Ngo H. Meng, 335 S.W.3d 797, 804 (Tex.App.--Dallas 2011, no pet.). “An\n\nimprovement includes all additions to the land other than trade fixtures that can be removed\n\nwithout injury to the property.” Id. Improvements that are not fixtures retain their character as\n\npersonal property. Id. By contrast, fixtures are pieces of personal property “that have become\n\npermanent parts of the realty to which they are affixed.” Id. [Internal citation omitted]. Fixtures\n\nare considered realty. Id. “Whether personalty has been affixed to realty depends on (1) the\n\nmode and sufficiency of annexation; (2) the adaption of personalty to the use or purpose of\n\nrealty; and (3) the intention of the owner.” Id.\n\n       In Appellant’s live pleading, she alleged Border Demolition converted the following\n\nobjects: “Antique Bricks,” “Red Rock,” “Three Antique Clawed Tubs,” “Three Antique\n\nPorcelain sinks,” “Iron Gate and Rock Fence,” “Two Garage Doors and motors,” and “Property\n\nFixtures.” Obviously, some, if not all, of the items listed in the live pleading are clearly fixtures\n\nto realty not subject to conversion claims. To the extent any item of that list could constitute an\n\nimprovement but not a fixture, Border Demolition challenged Appellant’s pleadings in its no-\n\nevidence motion on the basis that Appellant never alleged it exercised dominion over personal\n\nproperty. Thus, the burden was on Appellant to provide more than a scintilla of evidence that the\n\nitems she complained of were personalty and not realty. She failed to do so. As such, the trial\n\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fcourt’s rendition of summary judgment on this ground was proper.\n\n       Issue Three is overruled.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       Appellant’s final two issues assail the propriety of the attorneys’ fees award. In Issue\n\nFive, Appellant maintains Border Demolition waived its request for attorney’s fees. In Issue Six,\n\nAppellant asserts that Border Demolition failed to segregate recoverable work hours spent\n\ndefending against her Texas Theft Liability Act claim from non-recoverable hours spent\n\ndefending other claims.\n\n                                             Waiver\n\n       We first address waiver.       Appellant argues that Border Demolition waived its\n\ncounterclaim for attorney’s fees by failing to include it in its motion for summary judgment, and\n\nthat in order to “preserve” its claim, Border Demolition either needed to move for summary\n\njudgment on attorney’s fees or else “motion” the court for a hearing.         Border Demolition\n\ncounters that it properly pleaded for attorney’s fees and moved for partial summary judgment\n\nonly on Appellant’s claims, thereby validly leaving its own counterclaim for trial. We agree.\n\n       “[A] party’s omission of one of his claims from a motion for summary judgment does not\n\nwaive the claim because a party can always move for partial summary judgment[.]” McNally v.\n\nGuevara, 52 S.W.3d 195, 196 (Tex. 2001). Border Demolition did so here, electing to take its\n\nclaim for attorney’s fees to trial. Appellant cites State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Leasing Enters.,\n\nInc., 716 S.W.2d 553, 555 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.), in support of\n\nher contention that Border Demolition’s failure to include its request for attorney’s fees in its\n\nmotion for summary judgment waived the claim in its entirety. To the extent State Farm could\n\nbe read as applying to this case, we find McNally controls, as it is more recent, on-point, and\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fcontrolling mandatory authority from the Texas Supreme Court. Border Demolition’s claim for\n\nattorney’s fees was not waived. Issue Five is overruled.\n\n                         Attorney’s Fees: Segregation and Sufficiency\n\n        We next turn to the propriety of the attorney’s fee award. We construe Appellant’s brief\n\nas complaining both of lack of segregation and that the award given was excessive because it\n\nincluded amounts that were not recoverable as a matter of law.\n\n        Attorney’s fees are available to the prevailing party in a Texas Theft Liability Act suit.\n\nTEX.CIV.PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. § 134.005(b)(West 2011).              “Generally, a party seeking\n\nattorney’s fees must segregate those fees incurred in connection with a claim that allows their\n\nrecovery from fees incurred in connection with claims for which no such recovery is allowed.”\n\nAlief Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Perry, 440 S.W.3d 228, 245 (Tex.App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet.\n\ndenied). “Texas courts recognize an exception to this general rule.” Id. “When discrete legal\n\nservices advance both recoverable and unrecoverable claims, attorneys are not required to\n\nsegregate fees to recover the total amount covering all claims.” Id. The mere fact that a set of\n\nclaims is “dependent upon the same set of facts or circumstances” does not automatically mean\n\nthere is no need for segregation. Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313 [Internal citations\n\nomitted]. Instead, “[i]n making this [segregation] determination, we do not look at the legal\n\nwork as a whole, but parse the work into component tasks to determine which tasks relate to\n\nrecoverable claims.” Five Star Int’l Holdings, Inc. v. Thomson, Inc., 324 S.W.3d 160, 171\n\n(Tex.App.--El Paso 2010, pet. denied). “The need to segregate attorneys’ fees is a question of\n\nlaw, while the extent to which claims can or cannot be segregated is a mixed question of law and\n\nfact.” Penhollow Custom Homes, L.L.C. v. Kim, 320 S.W.3d 366, 374 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2010,\n\nno pet.).\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\f       If the fee movant survives the segregation inquiry, we then turn our attention to the legal\n\nand factual sufficiency of the evidence underpinning the award. See Tony Gullo Motors, 212\n\nS.W.3d at 314. We sustain a legal sufficiency challenge when the trial court’s decision is\n\nerroneous as a matter of law because (1) there is “a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact,”\n\n(2) “the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight to the only evidence\n\noffered to prove a vital fact,” (3) there is “no more than a mere scintilla” of evidence proving a\n\nvital fact, or (4) the evidence conclusively establishes the opposite proposition of a plaintiff’s\n\nproffered vital fact. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex. 2005). We may set\n\naside a damages verdict as legally insufficient “only if the evidence at trial would not enable\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review.” Garza de Escabedo v.\n\nHaygood, 283 S.W.3d 3, 6 (Tex.App.--Tyler 2009, pet. granted), aff’d sub nom. Haygood v. De\n\nEscabedo, 356 S.W.3d 390 (Tex. 2011). “In a factual sufficiency challenge, the court of appeals\n\nmust consider and weigh all of the evidence, and can set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so\n\nweak or if the finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that it is\n\nclearly wrong and unjust.” Samuels v. Nasir, 445 S.W.3d 886, 891 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2014, no\n\npet.)[Internal citations and quotation marks omitted].\n\n       The defense presented two expert witnesses. Appellant offered no expert witnesses of\n\nher own. Defense expert Carl Green testified that, based on his review of invoices, attorney\n\nJames Martinez and the law firm of Ray, Valdez, McChristian, and Jeans (“Ray McChristian”)\n\njointly incurred $77,501.59 in attorney’s fees through March 2011. Green opined that 20 percent\n\nof those fees advanced solely the non-theft claims, which he segregated out of his analysis. The\n\nremaining 80 percent of the attorney’s fees—totaling $62,001.27—either pertained solely to the\n\ntheft claim or else advanced defenses to both the theft claim and other claims, meaning that they\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fwere recoverable. Green also testified that Martinez and the law firm incurred $20,000 in fees\n\nrelated to trial preparation and time actually spent in the trial that was not reflected in the\n\ninvoices. When asked if the 80 percent rule applied to those fees as well, Green replied yes. On\n\ncross-examination, Green admitted that any legal charges incurred before Appellant pleaded her\n\ncivil theft claim on February 2, 2010, were not recoverable, since they could not have advanced\n\nthe defense against that claim. The jury returned an attorney’s fee verdict of $78,001.7 8\n\n         At trial and on appeal, Appellant complains that it was improper for the jury to consider\n\nfees accrued before she filed her civil theft claim on February 2, 2010.\n\n         We agree with Appellant, and with Border Demolition’s expert Carl Green, that fees\n\naccrued before Appellant filed her civil theft claim are not recoverable. However, we disagree\n\nthat the attorneys failed to segregate recoverable and non-recoverable fees.\n\n         There is ample evidence to show that the jury was given the correct framework to use in\n\nmeasuring the adequacy of attorney’s fees. Although the trial court admitted invoices dating\n\nback to before the recoverable claim were pleaded, the invoices contained detailed descriptions\n\nof the tasks each attorney performed so that the jury could assess their relevance. Cf. Prudential\n\nIns. Co. v. Durante, 443 S.W.3d 499, 513 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2014, pet. filed)(“Unsegregated\n\nfees are some evidence of what the segregated amount should be . . . .”).\n\n         Further, Tony Gullo Motors recognized an illustrative class of discrete legal tasks such as\n\n“[r]equests for standard disclosures, proof of background facts, depositions of the primary actors,\n\ndiscovery motions and hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services [that] may be\n\nnecessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others.” Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\n7\n We note this amount is close to the sum total of $62,001.27—i.e. 80 percent of the invoices through March 2011—\nand $16,000—i.e. 80 percent of $20,000 in trial preparation fees.\n8\n  Attorney James Martinez also testified that he believed that between 80 and 90 percent of the fees were\nrecoverable.\n\n                                                         21\n\fThe record reflects that once Appellant pleaded her civil theft claim on February 2, 2010, all\n\nsubsequent invoiced entries either fell neatly within the class of discrete legal tasks that advanced\n\nboth recoverable and non-recoverable claims, or else there was a fact question as to the propriety\n\nof those charges that was properly submitted to the jury. See Penhollow Custom Homes, L.L.C.,\n\n320 S.W.3d at 374 (the extent to which claims may be segregated, as opposed to the need for\n\nsegregation in the first place, is a mixed question of fact and law). “To the extent such services\n\nwould have been incurred on a recoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply because\n\nthey do double service.” Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\n       Finally, Border Demolition provided two expert opinions—one from Carl Green, one\n\nfrom James Martinez himself—specifying percentages of fees the jury should segregate out in\n\nreaching its verdict. Numerous cases show that use of an expert citing a percentage amount of\n\nsegregable fees is permissible. See, e.g., Penhollow Custom Homes, L.L.C., 320 S.W.3d at 374.\n\nWe believe that under the facts of this case, Border Demolition sufficiently established\n\nsegregation. See Alief Indep. Sch. Dist., 440 S.W.3d at 246-47 (attorney’s testimony that he\n\nreduced the total amount of fees by 10 percent to account for non-recoverable fees was sufficient\n\nto establish segregation).\n\n       Instead, we find Appellant’s point is more properly cast as a legal and factual sufficiency\n\npoint. The issue here is whether the jury awarded more fees than were supported by the\n\nevidence, given that the relative percentages between segregable and non-segregable fees as\n\nassessed by the experts were legally incorrect. Green testified that in his professional opinion,\n\n20 percent of the total invoice fees, or $15,500.32, should be segregated out. As stated above,\n\nthe jury apparently relied on that number in reaching its verdict. However, Green also admitted\n\non cross-examination that the jury should not consider any invoiced amounts prior to February 2,\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f2010 in its decision. In actuality, based on Border Demolition’s own fee summary schedule, fees\n\naccrued prior to the filing of the civil theft claim in February 2010 amount to about 29 percent of\n\ntotal invoice fees—$22,534.40 to be precise. Thus, as a matter of law, the jury could only award\n\na maximum of $54,967.19, or about 71 percent, which represented the invoiced amounts\n\nincurred after Appellant pleaded her civil theft claim. When the correct invoice percentage is\n\ncombined with $20,000 in undisputed trial preparation and attendance fees Border Demolition\n\nincurred, the maximum legally and factually supportable attorney’s fees the jury could have\n\nawarded would have been $74,967.19. The verdict rendered by the jury exceeds this amount by\n\n$3,033.81.\n\n       We possess the inherent power in a civil case to suggest a remittitur under TEX.R.APP.P.\n\n46.3 where an “appellant complains there is insufficient evidence to support an award and the\n\ncourt of appeals agrees, but concludes there is sufficient evidence to support a lesser award.”\n\nSamuels, 445 S.W.3d at 894 [Internal citation omitted]. Here, because the evidence is legally\n\nand factually sufficient to support an award, but not in the amount given, and because re-trial\n\nmay not be the most expedient way to resolve this discrepancy, Border Demolition has a choice.\n\nIf within 15 days of this opinion’s issuance, Border Demolition and the Solises choose to accept\n\na remittitur of $3,033.81—the difference between the jury verdict given and the maximum jury\n\naward supportable by legally and factually sufficient evidence—, we will reform the trial court’s\n\njudgment and affirm as modified. If not, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and this\n\ncause will be remanded for a new trial on attorney’s fees.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s summary judgment in its entirety with respect to Appellees\n\nBonnie and Raul Solis. With respect to Border Demolition, we affirm the trial court’s summary\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fjudgment as to Issues Two, Three, and Four. Issue Five is overruled. We reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s summary judgment as to Issue One and remand for further proceedings on Appellant’s\n\ntrespass claim.\n\n       We also reverse the trial court’s judgment on attorney’s fees because it rests on\n\ninsufficient evidence (Issue Six). We suggest a remittitur of $3,033.81 to Border Demolition and\n\nthe Solises. Appellees have 15 days from the date of this opinion’s issuance to accept remittitur.\n\nIf remittitur is accepted, the judgment of the trial court will be reformed to reflect an attorney’s\n\nfees award of $74,967.19, and we will affirm the judgment as modified. If Appellees do not\n\naccept remittitur within that period of time, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and\n\nthis cause remanded for a new trial on attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n                                              YVONNE T.

Appellant Teresa Corral-Lerma filed suit against Border Demolition & Environmental,\n\nInc. (“Border Demolition”) and Raul and Bonnie Solis (“the Solises”) 1 after the defendants razed\n\na residential structure on her land and purportedly absconded with personal property without her\n\nauthorization. Border Demolition moved for hybrid summary judgment, contending inter alia\n\nthat her husband Eduardo Lerma authorized the demolition on her behalf as her agent. 2 The trial\n\n1\n For brevity’s sake, we will refer to the Appellees collectively as “Border Demolition” unless circumstances require\nus to make a distinction among them.\n2\n    In a separate trial, Border Demolition obtained a jury verdict holding Eduardo Lerma personally liable for\n\fcourt granted summary judgment in favor of Border Demolition on all claims and awarded more\n\nthan $75,000 in attorneys’ fees at a subsequent trial.\n\n        Appellant seeks reversal and reinstatement of her claims, arguing that numerous genuine\n\nissues of material fact precluded summary judgment. She also urges us to vacate the attorneys’\n\nfee award on waiver and sufficiency grounds. We affirm the trial court’s summary judgment in\n\npart, reverse it in part, and remand for trial on Appellant’s trespass claim. We also suggest a\n\nremittitur of attorney’s fees.\n\n                                           BACKGROUND\n\n                                            Factual History\n\n        Corral-Lerma appeals the trial court’s granting of Border Demolition’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment and as such, we review only the evidence properly contained within the\n\nsummary judgment record at the time of rendition. In 2008, the City of El Paso condemned and\n\nthreatened to demolish a residential structure located at 7429 Rose Lane Circle (“the Property”).\n\nAppellant purports to be the sole owner of the property, and two deeds in the record indicate that\n\nher husband, Eduardo Lerma, attempted to convey his undivided one-half interest in the\n\nProperty—then indisputably held as community property—during the mid-to-late 1980s\n\nAppellant admitted that she never truly wanted the house on the Property to be demolished and\n\nstated that she was still pursuing an appeal of the City of El Paso’s order at the time her husband\n\nsolicited demolition bids.       Her husband Eduardo, an attorney, acted as her attorney by\n\nrepresenting her in the condemnation proceedings before the City.\n\n        Eventually, Eduardo Lerma contacted Border Demolition, owned by the Solises, and\n\nsolicited a bid for demolition work for the Property. Border Demolition sent Lerma a proposed\n\ndemolition costs on oral contract and equitable grounds. We affirmed that judgment on appeal.

Appellant testified in her deposition that her\n\nhusband only collected the bid; they agreed she would close and decide final terms of the\n\ndemolition contract for herself. She also denied ever authorizing Border Demolition to perform\n\nthe demolition work as stated in the proposed contract. Instead, she stated she contacted Border\n\nDemolition to inform them of her objections to the contract and to set up a meeting to further\n\ndiscuss terms. The evidence is undisputed that neither Appellant nor her husband ever signed the\n\nproposed contract. However, Eduardo Lerma did make representations in a letter to the City of\n\nEl Paso that he had personally hired Border Demolition to perform the demolition work during\n\nthe condemnation appeal.\n\n         In July 2008, Border Demolition’s sub-contractor, M&F Trucking, demolished the\n\nresidential structure on the Property. Border Demolition did not possess a key to the property at\n\nthe time of demolition and tore down the front gate to enter the property.                          Later, Border\n\nDemolition sued Eduardo Lerma for breach of contract.

The defendants raised a counterclaim for\n\nattorney’s fees under the Texas Theft Liability Act.\n\n         Border Demolition and the Solises moved for hybrid summary judgment, challenging\n\nmultiple elements of each of the first seven causes of action on no-evidence grounds before\n\narguing traditional grounds in the alternative. The defendants later supplemented their hybrid\n\nsummary judgment motion to include the civil theft claim.\n\n         The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Border Demolition and the Solises\n\non all claims, but it did not specify upon which grounds its judgment rested. Appellant filed a\n\nnotice of appeal. We abated the appeal pending entry of judgment after trial.4\n\n         At trial, the jury awarded Border Demolition and the Solises $78,001 in attorneys’ fees.\n\nAppellant took appeal from that judgment as well. We consolidated these two actions into the\n\nsingle case at bar. Following extended mandamus proceedings5 interrupted by an automatic\n\nbankruptcy stay, the Texas Supreme Court granted Appellant’s mandamus relief and lifted its\n\nstay on this Court. We address the merits of this appeal below.\n\n                                                  DISCUSSION\n\n         In six issues, Appellant asserts that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment as\n\nto her claims for intentional and negligent trespass, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation,\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the appeal pre-trial, contending that Appellant was attempting to seek improper\ninterlocutory review of the summary judgment order by filing her notice of appeal because the issue of attorney’s\nfees had subsequently been litigated at trial. In an order dated June 1, 2011, we agreed that Appellant’s filing of the\nnotice of appeal was premature and impermissibly interlocutory, given that the issue of attorney’s fees had been set\nfor trial at the time. Nevertheless, because trial had already concluded, and given that the trial court would not enter\na final judgment on the verdict due to pendency of this appeal, we abated the appeal to allow for entry of final\njudgment so that we could treat the premature NOA as subsuming both trial and summary judgment issues.\n5\n See Corral-Lerma v.

Finally,\n\nAppellant challenges the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees, contending that Appellees waived\n\ntheir right to claim fees by failing to raise the issue at summary judgment, or, alternatively, that\n\nAppellees’ failure to segregate recoverable fees from non-recoverable fees at trial was fatal.\n\n        Appellees counter that we should affirm summary judgment as to four causes of action\n\nbecause Appellant failed to properly assign error. Appellees further maintain that summary\n\njudgment as to the remaining claim was proper under either traditional or no-evidence review.\n\nThe Solises separately argue that Appellant waived any objection to the judgment rendered in\n\ntheir favor because she only argued her case with respect to Border Demolition and never\n\nactually raised legal arguments directed at them in her brief. Finally, Appellees collectively\n\ncontend they did not waive their claim to attorney’s fees and that the trial court committed no\n\nreversible error in awarding fees.\n\n        We begin by jointly addressing the procedural objections and summary judgment points\n\nbefore moving on to the attorney’s fees analysis.\n\n                                                         I.\n\n                                Standard of Review: Summary Judgment\n\n        We review summary judgment grants de novo.

Indeed, Bonnie Solis is only mentioned in\n\npassing in the statement of facts section of Appellant’s brief, but never in the body of the brief.\n\nHer position in the controversy is never made clear, nor does Appellant put forth any argument\n\nas to her liability on appeal. As such, Appellant waived any claims against Bonnie Solis. As for\n\nthe portions of Appellant’s brief dealing with Raul Solis, he correctly notes that Appellant\n\nframes her legal argument entirely in terms of Border Demolition, mentioning Raul Solis only as\n\na party at Border Demolition with whom she had contact. She never explicitly argues why the\n\njudgment as to Raul Solis was improper. Even under the liberal construction rules, we can see\n\nno substantive legal argument presented that would allow us to review the propriety of the\n\njudgment with respect to Raul Solis. Appellant’s challenge to the summary judgment with\n\nrespect to the Solises is waived, and we affirm summary judgment as to Raul and Bonnie Solis.\n\n                                                B.\n\n                                      Assignment of Error\n\n       As another preliminary matter, Border Demolition argues that injury is an element of\n\nthree causes of action that it challenged in its motion before the trial court—namely, fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentation, conversion, and civil theft. Because Appellant failed to make any appellate\n\nargument as to injury in addressing these causes of action, Border Demolition maintains that we\n\nshould affirm summary judgment as to those claims.\n\n       An appellant’s precision in crafting an argument that attacks all possible grounds for the\n\ntrial court’s judgment is critical to avoid appellate waiver. “When there are multiple grounds for\n\nsummary judgment and the order does not specify the ground on which the summary judgment\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fwas rendered, the appealing party must negate all grounds on appeal.” Moore v.

On page 27 of her brief, Appellant explicitly states “Mrs. Lerma incurred injury as a\n\nresult because her real property was demolished.” Error was properly assigned, and we review\n\nthe merits of Issue Two below.\n\n        As for Issue Three, the claim for conversion, Appellant alleged in her brief that Border\n\nDemolition removed and exercised dominion over certain property from the home during the\n\ndemolition process. In construing Appellant’s brief under the liberal construction standards, we\n\nfind that is enough to assign error to the issue of injury or damages and review the merits of\n\nIssue Three.\n\n        In Issue Four, dealing with civil theft, Appellant’s no-evidence argument focuses on\n\nrebutting Border Demolition’s effective consent point.       Here, Appellant never explicitly\n\naddresses the injury issue raised in Border Demolition’s motion. Because that element was\n\nspecifically challenged in the motion for summary judgment, and because Appellant failed to\n\naddress that element on appeal, we must affirm the summary judgment as to the civil theft claim.\n\n        Issue Four is overruled.\n\n                                                 C.\n\n                                   Adequacy of No-Evidence Motion\n\n        Appellant also raises a threshold procedural point, arguing that Border Demolition’s no-\n\nevidence points on her claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and conversion must fail because\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fthey do not specify which elements of those claims are under attack. Specifically, Appellant\n\ncontends that by saying she showed “no evidence of various elements” on those claims, Border\n\nDemolition waived its ability to test those claims on no-evidence review.\n\n       Appellant misconstrues the language in Border Demolition’s no-evidence points and\n\nreads it out of context. Appellant is correct that if Border Demolition had lodged only general\n\nno-evidence objections in its motion for summary judgment, the motion would be defective and\n\nsummary judgment on those grounds would fail. See TEX.R.CIV.P. 166a(i). Appellant is also\n\ncorrect that Border Demolition made prefatory comments that Appellant failed to provide\n\nevidence on “various elements” in certain portions of its motion. However, Border Demolition\n\nset out all the elements to each of those claims in the no-evidence portion of its summary\n\njudgment, then specifically identified which individual elements it was challenging. That is\n\nsufficient to raise those points under Rule 166a(i).

No-Evidence Review\n\n       Border Demolition raised two no-evidence points related to both intentional and\n\nnegligent trespass in its appellate brief. First, Border Demolition contended that Appellant\n\nprovided no evidence of compensable damages to the land in form of lost market value, loss of\n\nuse, or otherwise because according to her own estimates, the value of the property went up once\n\ndemolition occurred. Second, Border Demolition asserted that Appellant put forth no evidence\n\nto support a claim for mental anguish or similar damages. Appellant correctly notes that she\n\nnever requested mental anguish damages in her live pleadings when summary judgment was\n\nrendered. Thus, we entertain only Border Demolition’s no-evidence point on property damage.\n\n       Appellant maintains that she did not need to raise more than a scintilla of evidence on the\n\nissue of injury because injury and nominal damages are presumed in trespass cases. We agree.\n\n“[T]respass against a possessory interest . . . does not require actual injury to be actionable and\n\nmay result in an award of nominal damages.” Hill v.

Border Demolition’s argument on this issue is without merit, and\n\nAppellant’s trespass claim survives no-evidence review.\n\n                             b. Traditional Summary Judgment Review\n\n       We next turn to Border Demolition’s traditional grounds and its consent defense. Border\n\nDemolition advances a two-pronged consent argument in defense of summary judgment on this\n\nclaim. See Gen. Mills Rests., Inc., 12 S.W.3d at 835 (consent is a defense to trespass).\n\n       First, Border Demolition contends that Teresa Corral-Lerma was not the sole owner of\n\nthe Property.   Although Eduardo Lerma purportedly conveyed his community interest to\n\nAppellant in the 1980s to grant her the Property as her separate property, Border Demolition\n\nmaintains the conveyance was actually null and void.           As such, the Property remained\n\ncommunity property, and Eduardo Lerma, as co-owner, could consent to entry. In response,\n\nAppellant points to two deeds—a quitclaim deed from 1986 and a subsequent special warranty\n\ndeed from 1989 in which Eduardo Lerma purports to convey his one-half undivided interest in\n\nthe Property to Appellant. Border Demolition points to no contravening documentary evidence\n\nand cites no legal authority explaining why these deeds were defective. As such, based on the\n\nrecord before us, Border Demolition’s contention that Eduardo Lerma retained a legal interest in\n\nthe Property sufficient to grant him consent authority is only conjecture. At best, Eduardo\n\nLerma’s representation to third parties that he owned the Property raises a fact issue on\n\nownership that would preclude summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       Second, Border Demolition argues that even if Eduardo Lerma had no separate authority\n\nto consent to any entries, Appellant granted him the actual authority to enter into a transaction\n\nwith Border Demolition as her agent, or, at the very least, that she allowed Eduardo Lerma to\n\ncloak himself in her apparent authority and did nothing to correct Border Demolition’s\n\nreasonable reliance on his representations. Appellant maintains she only gave her husband\n\nauthority to solicit bids for the demolition, but she retained authority to ultimately decide who\n\nwould demolish the structures and on what terms. She also points to her own deposition\n\ntestimony, in which she claims to have called and spoken with Solis about her objections to the\n\ncontract, as proof that Border Demolition should have known the scope of Eduardo Lerma’s\n\nagency was limited.\n\n       “An agent is a person who is authorized by another to transact business or manage some\n\naffair by that person’s authority and on account of it.” Crooks v.

Instead, she claims that she only gave him the authority to solicit bids\n\nfor her review. Border Demolition argues that the summary judgment evidence established, as a\n\nmatter of law, that it had a reasonable belief that Eduardo Lerma acted with apparent authority\n\nbecause he held himself out as the owner of the house. Regardless of how many times Eduardo\n\nLerma told people he was the owner of the house, his representations alone do not bind\n\nAppellant to any consent he gave. “Only the conduct of the principal may be considered;\n\nrepresentations made by the agent of his authority have no effect.” Suarez, 35 S.W.3d at 273.\n\nTo the extent Border Demolition maintains that Eduardo Lerma’s representations are proof that\n\nAppellant acquiesced to his agency and that it was justified in believing Eduardo Lerma had\n\napparent authority, the facts on this point are disputed. Appellant testified in deposition that she\n\ncalled Border Demolition’s employees, informed them prior to demolition that she wanted to\n\ndiscuss the contract, and that Solis told her he would call her back to address her concerns. This\n\ncreates a fact question as to whether Border Demolition reasonably believed Eduardo Lerma was\n\nthe ultimate decision maker acting with his wife’s authority.\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\f       In short, there are disputed issues of material fact concerning Eduardo Lerma’s ability to\n\nconsent to Border Demolition’s entry onto the property, either in his own right or as his wife’s\n\nagent. As such, Border Demolition cannot defeat Appellant’s trespass claim as a matter of law,\n\nand summary judgment on this point was improper.\n\n       Issue One is sustained.\n\n                                                  2.\n\n                         Fraudulent and Negligent Misrepresentation\n\n       In Issue Two, Appellant maintains that we should reverse summary judgment on her\n\nnegligent misrepresentation and fraudulent misrepresentation claims.           We disagree.      The\n\nelements of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation are:\n\n       1. defendant made a representation to the plaintiff in the course of\n       defendant’s business or in a transaction in which the defendant had an\n       interest;\n\n       2. defendant supplied false information for the guidance of others;\n\n       3. defendant did not exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining\n       or communicating the information;\n\n       4. plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation;\n\n       5. defendant’s negligent misrepresentation proximately caused the\n       plaintiff’s injury.\n\n       Miller v.

We must nevertheless review the merits of the\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fsummary judgment here.

Here, the nucleus of\n\nAppellant’s negligent misrepresentation claim is that Border Demolition promised not to act in\n\nthe future, i.e., it would refrain from demolishing the house. That future promise falls squarely\n\noutside the scope of what is cognizable as a negligent misrepresentation claim. As such, the trial\n\ncourt properly rendered summary judgment on that claim.\n\n       We also find that summary judgment on Appellant’s fraudulent misrepresentation claim\n\nwas proper. The elements of fraud are as follows:\n\n       (1) that a material representation was made;\n\n       (2) the representation was false;\n\n       (3) when the representation was made, the speaker knew it was false or made it recklessly\n       without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion;\n\n       (4) the speaker made the representation with the intent that the other party should act\n       upon it;\n\n       (5) the party acted in reliance on the representation; and\n\n       (6) the party thereby suffered injury.\n\n       Salazar v.

We agree that there was no evidence Appellant acted\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\fin reliance on that information to her detriment. Indeed, Appellant disputes the very fact that she\n\nentered into a transaction with Border Demolition, maintaining that her position was always that\n\nshe would not consent to demolition until they reached a final agreement. However, “[w]ithout a\n\nbinding agreement, there is no detrimental reliance, and thus no fraudulent inducement claim.”\n\nHaase, 62 S.W.3d at 798. Appellant never directly explains, and we cannot independently see,\n\nhow her “reliance” on Border Demolition’s assurances that it would not demolish the home until\n\na final agreement was reached fits within fraud’s elemental framework. Border Demolition may\n\nhave acted without her direct permission, but there is no evidence that it induced her into\n\nconsummating a transaction or otherwise acting in reliance on its purportedly fraudulent\n\nrepresentations. See id. Absent proof of her reliance on Border Demolition’s word, summary\n\njudgment on Appellant’s fraud claim will stand.\n\n   Issue Two is overruled.\n\n                                                3.\n\n                                           Conversion\n\n       In Issue Three, Appellant contends the trial court erred by granting summary judgment\n\nagainst her conversion claims. Again, Border Demolition declined to file a responsive argument\n\nto Appellant’s contentions in its brief, relying solely on the assignment of error point we\n\noverruled above. We proceed without the benefit of Appellees’ argument.\n\n       “To establish a claim for conversion, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the plaintiff owned or\n\nhad possession of the property or entitlement to possession; (2) the defendant unlawfully and\n\nwithout authorization assumed and exercised control over the property to the exclusion of, or\n\ninconsistent with, the plaintiff’s rights as an owner; (3) the plaintiff demanded return of the\n\nproperty; and (4) the defendant refused to return the property.” Burns v.

To the extent any item of that list could constitute an\n\nimprovement but not a fixture, Border Demolition challenged Appellant’s pleadings in its no-\n\nevidence motion on the basis that Appellant never alleged it exercised dominion over personal\n\nproperty.

Appellant offered no expert witnesses of\n\nher own. Defense expert Carl Green testified that, based on his review of invoices, attorney\n\nJames Martinez and the law firm of Ray, Valdez, McChristian, and Jeans (“Ray McChristian”)\n\njointly incurred $77,501.59 in attorney’s fees through March 2011. Green opined that 20 percent\n\nof those fees advanced solely the non-theft claims, which he segregated out of his analysis. The\n\nremaining 80 percent of the attorney’s fees—totaling $62,001.27—either pertained solely to the\n\ntheft claim or else advanced defenses to both the theft claim and other claims, meaning that they\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\fwere recoverable. Green also testified that Martinez and the law firm incurred $20,000 in fees\n\nrelated to trial preparation and time actually spent in the trial that was not reflected in the\n\ninvoices. When asked if the 80 percent rule applied to those fees as well, Green replied yes. On\n\ncross-examination, Green admitted that any legal charges incurred before Appellant pleaded her\n\ncivil theft claim on February 2, 2010, were not recoverable, since they could not have advanced\n\nthe defense against that claim. The jury returned an attorney’s fee verdict of $78,001.7 8\n\n         At trial and on appeal, Appellant complains that it was improper for the jury to consider\n\nfees accrued before she filed her civil theft claim on February 2, 2010.\n\n         We agree with Appellant, and with Border Demolition’s expert Carl Green, that fees\n\naccrued before Appellant filed her civil theft claim are not recoverable. However, we disagree\n\nthat the attorneys failed to segregate recoverable and non-recoverable fees.\n\n         There is ample evidence to show that the jury was given the correct framework to use in\n\nmeasuring the adequacy of attorney’s fees. Although the trial court admitted invoices dating\n\nback to before the recoverable claim were pleaded, the invoices contained detailed descriptions\n\nof the tasks each attorney performed so that the jury could assess their relevance. Cf. Prudential\n\nIns. Co. v. Durante, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (Tex.App.--El Paso 2014, pet. filed)(“Unsegregated\n\nfees are some evidence of what the segregated amount should be . . . .”).\n\n         Further, Tony Gullo Motors recognized an illustrative class of discrete legal tasks such as\n\n“[r]equests for standard disclosures, proof of background facts, depositions of the primary actors,\n\ndiscovery motions and hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host of other services [that] may be\n\nnecessary whether a claim is filed alone or with others.” Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\n7\n We note this amount is close to the sum total of $62,001.27—i.e. 80 percent of the invoices through March 2011—\nand $16,000—i.e. 80 percent of $20,000 in trial preparation fees.\n8\n  Attorney James Martinez also testified that he believed that between 80 and 90 percent of the fees were\nrecoverable.\n\n                                                         21\n\fThe record reflects that once Appellant pleaded her civil theft claim on February 2, 2010, all\n\nsubsequent invoiced entries either fell neatly within the class of discrete legal tasks that advanced\n\nboth recoverable and non-recoverable claims, or else there was a fact question as to the propriety\n\nof those charges that was properly submitted to the jury. See Penhollow Custom Homes, L.L.C.,\n\n320 S.W.3d at 374 (the extent to which claims may be segregated, as opposed to the need for\n\nsegregation in the first place, is a mixed question of fact and law). “To the extent such services\n\nwould have been incurred on a recoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply because\n\nthey do double service.” Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d at 313.\n\n       Finally, Border Demolition provided two expert opinions—one from Carl Green, one\n\nfrom James Martinez himself—specifying percentages of fees the jury should segregate out in\n\nreaching its verdict. Numerous cases show that use of an expert citing a percentage amount of\n\nsegregable fees is permissible. See, e.g., Penhollow Custom Homes, L.L.C., 320 S.W.3d at 374.\n\nWe believe that under the facts of this case, Border Demolition sufficiently established\n\nsegregation. See Alief Indep. Sch. Dist., 440 S.W.3d at 246-47 (attorney’s testimony that he\n\nreduced the total amount of fees by 10 percent to account for non-recoverable fees was sufficient\n\nto establish segregation).\n\n       Instead, we find Appellant’s point is more properly cast as a legal and factual sufficiency\n\npoint. The issue here is whether the jury awarded more fees than were supported by the\n\nevidence, given that the relative percentages between segregable and non-segregable fees as\n\nassessed by the experts were legally incorrect. Green testified that in his professional opinion,\n\n20 percent of the total invoice fees, or $15,500.32, should be segregated out. As stated above,\n\nthe jury apparently relied on that number in reaching its verdict. However, Green also admitted\n\non cross-examination that the jury should not consider any invoiced amounts prior to February 2,\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\f2010 in its decision. In actuality, based on Border Demolition’s own fee summary schedule, fees\n\naccrued prior to the filing of the civil theft claim in February 2010 amount to about 29 percent of\n\ntotal invoice fees—$22,534.40 to be precise. Thus, as a matter of law, the jury could only award\n\na maximum of $54,967.19, or about 71 percent, which represented the invoiced amounts\n\nincurred after Appellant pleaded her civil theft claim. When the correct invoice percentage is\n\ncombined with $20,000 in undisputed trial preparation and attendance fees Border Demolition\n\nincurred, the maximum legally and factually supportable attorney’s fees the jury could have\n\nawarded would have been $74,967.19. The verdict rendered by the jury exceeds this amount by\n\n$3,033.81.\n\n       We possess the inherent power in a civil case to suggest a remittitur under TEX.R.APP.P.\n\n46.3 where an “appellant complains there is insufficient evidence to support an award and the\n\ncourt of appeals agrees, but concludes there is sufficient evidence to support a lesser award.”\n\nSamuels, 445 S.W.3d at 894 [Internal citation omitted]. Here, because the evidence is legally\n\nand factually sufficient to support an award, but not in the amount given, and because re-trial\n\nmay not be the most expedient way to resolve this discrepancy, Border Demolition has a choice.\n\nIf within 15 days of this opinion’s issuance, Border Demolition and the Solises choose to accept\n\na remittitur of $3,033.81—the difference between the jury verdict given and the maximum jury\n\naward supportable by legally and factually sufficient evidence—, we will reform the trial court’s\n\njudgment and affirm as modified. If not, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and this\n\ncause will be remanded for a new trial on attorney’s fees.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the trial court’s summary judgment in its entirety with respect to Appellees\n\nBonnie and Raul Solis. With respect to Border Demolition, we affirm the trial court’s summary\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fjudgment as to Issues Two, Three, and Four. Issue Five is overruled. We reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s summary judgment as to Issue One and remand for further proceedings on Appellant’s\n\ntrespass claim.\n\n       We also reverse the trial court’s judgment on attorney’s fees because it rests on\n\ninsufficient evidence (Issue Six). We suggest a remittitur of $3,033.81 to Border Demolition and\n\nthe Solises. Appellees have 15 days from the date of this opinion’s issuance to accept remittitur.\n\nIf remittitur is accepted, the judgment of the trial court will be reformed to reflect an attorney’s\n\nfees award of $74,967.19, and we will affirm the judgment as modified. If Appellees do not\n\naccept remittitur within that period of time, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and\n\nthis cause remanded for a new trial on attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n                                              YVONNE T.
