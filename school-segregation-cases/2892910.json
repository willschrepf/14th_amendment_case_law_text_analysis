Moore has\nadvanced osteoarthritis in his back. Like all NECC inmates, Moore was required to\nwork six hours per day. NECC allows an inmate to be exempted from work if he has\nreceived a medical “lay-in” from the prison medical unit or declares a “medical\nemergency” due to an acute medical problem, serious illness, injury, or trauma. If an\ninmate declares a medical emergency, he is sent to the prison medical unit for\ntreatment.\n\n       For the first year of his incarceration at NECC, Moore had no work restrictions.\nHowever, on March 28, 2001, Moore’s duty status was reclassified, and he was\nrestricted to no more than twenty-five pounds of lifting and two hours of standing.\nOn June 14, 2001, Moore’s duty status was further reclassified to limited duty with\nno prolonged standing and no lifting of over five pounds.\n\n       Moore’s § 1983 claim was filed on June 18, 2001, and concerns his work\nassignment on the “captain’s crew,” a work detail that cleans and maintains the prison\nyard by mowing the grass, picking up trash, and, in the winter, shoveling snow and\nclearing ice from the walkways. Moore contends the work assignment constituted\n\n\n      1\n       The Honorable E. Richard Webber, United States District Judge for the\nEastern District of Missouri.\n      2\n       Moore filed suit against twenty-eight individuals. The district court\nimmediately dismissed four individuals under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), and later\ndismissed another for lack of timely service.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment because of his physical\ndisabilities and because he was forced to work in extreme weather conditions without\nappropriate protective clothing and forced to handle bio-hazardous waste without\nappropriate protective gear.\n\n       We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary judgment on Moore’s\nEighth Amendment claim. See Murphy v. Mo. Dep’t of Corr., 372 F.3d 979, 982 (8th\nCir. 2004). The Eighth Amendment requires prison officials to provide humane\nconditions of confinement. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994). A\nprison official may be liable for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement\nonly if he or she “knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or\nsafety.” Id. at 837.\n\n       Moore first claims he was forced to work on the captain’s crew despite his\nphysical disabilities. There is no dispute that forcing an inmate to work beyond his\nphysical abilities could pose a serious risk to an inmate’s health or safety. See\nMadewell v. Roberts, 909 F.2d 1203, 1207 (8th Cir. 1990). There is also no dispute\nthat Moore suffers from back problems. However, at all times relevant to the\nComplaint, Moore was not under any medical restrictions that prevented him from\nworking on the captain’s crew. Although work restrictions were imposed on\nMarch 28, 2001, Moore was not given a medical lay-in, and the record shows he\nworked within the restrictions while on the captain’s crew. Cf. Williams v. Norris,\n148 F.3d 983, 987 (8th Cir. 1998) (finding sufficient evidence that prison officials\nviolated the Eighth Amendment by forcing an inmate to work in excess of his medical\nrestrictions). Furthermore, in the absence of a medical lay-in or any other medical\nconfirmation to support Moore’s assertions that he was too injured to work, there is\nno evidence to show that NECC officials were aware that working on the captain’s\ncrew posed a risk to Moore’s health or safety.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f      Moore next claims he was forced to work outside without appropriate clothing\nregardless of the weather conditions. We do not dispute that forcing inmates to\nendure extreme weather conditions without proper protection violates the Eighth\nAmendment. See Chandler v. Moore, 2 F.3d 847, 848 (8th Cir. 1993). Nonetheless,\nthe Defendants’ undisputed summary judgment evidence shows (1) that NECC\ninmates are provided standard issue clothing, including pants, shirts, socks, shoes, a\nduck coat, and a stocking cap; (2) that inmates working on the captain’s crew may\nrequest gloves and insulated coveralls for use during their shifts; and (3) that heavy\nwork gloves are also available for inmates to purchase in the prison canteen. Moore\nhas not come forward with any evidence to refute that the clothing provided to him\nwas appropriate to protect him from the weather. The fact that Moore chose not to\nobtain and use the extra clothing available to inmates working on the captain’s crew\ndoes not mean he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Moore also alleges\nhe was forced to work outside “with lightning crashing all around him.” However,\nhe provides no evidence to refute the Defendants’ evidence that inmates are not\nrequired to work in inclement weather and merely relies on the allegations in his\nComplaint. This is not sufficient to survive a motion for summary judgment. See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n       Finally, Moore claims he was forced to handle bio-hazardous waste by virtue\nof having to pick up cigarette butts and other refuse from the prison yard. However,\nthe record shows, and Moore does not dispute, that he had access to protective gloves\nwhile working on the captain’s crew and was not required to handle any items\ncontaining bodily fluids because specially trained individuals could have been called\nto clean up such items. Thus, we agree with the district court’s conclusion that\npicking up trash did not expose Moore to a serious risk of harm.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f        Moore raises three other issues on appeal. First, Moore challenges the district\ncourt’s dismissal of four DOC officials3 under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). After de\nnovo review of the record, we conclude Moore’s allegations against these officials did\nnot state a claim. See Powells v. Minnehaha County Sheriff Dep’t, 198 F.3d 711, 712\n(8th Cir. 1999) (per curiam) (standard of review). Viewing the factual allegations in\nthe Complaint in the light most favorable to Moore, see Schaller Tel. Co. v. Golden\nSky Sys., Inc., 298 F.3d 736, 740 (8th Cir. 2002), we conclude Moore can prove no\nset of facts to support his claim that the officials committed a constitutional violation\nby telling him he must either return to work or face segregation.\n\n       Second, Moore argues the district court erred in denying his motion to strike\nthe Defendants’ summary judgment evidence because the Defendants failed to\ndisclose the evidence in response to his discovery requests. Upon review of the\nrecord, we find no abuse of discretion in district court’s denial of Moore’s motion to\nstrike or in the district court’s management of the protracted, adversarial discovery\nprocess in this case. See Life Plus Int’l v. Brown, 317 F.3d 799, 803, 806 (8th Cir.\n2003) (standard of review).\n\n       Finally, Moore argues the district court erred in awarding costs to the\nDefendants for obtaining transcripts from Moore’s deposition and the hearing on\nMoore’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Having reviewed the award of costs for\nan abuse of discretion, see Zotos v. Lindbergh Sch. Dist., 121 F.3d 356, 363 (8th Cir.\n1997), we find none. Although the district court ultimately found that Moore’s\ndeposition was inadmissible, we agree with the district court’s finding that the\ndeposition appeared reasonably necessary at the time it was taken. See id. at 363-64\n(costs for taking a deposition may be awarded if the deposition was reasonably\nnecessary when it was taken). Also, the fact that the Defendants did not make use of\n\n\n      3\n      The officials were identified in the Complaint as K. Bergner, Unknown\nLedbetter, Unknown Green, and Unknown Kitner.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe preliminary hearing transcript in their summary judgment papers does not\npreclude an award of costs for the transcript. See id.\n\n     Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We also\ndeny Moore’s pending motion for sanctions.\n\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f",
