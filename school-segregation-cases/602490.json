William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                         Before\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n     Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\nJ. Allen Holland, with whom John R. Cavanaugh and Lynch,\nBrewer, Hoffman &amp; Sands, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\nJames F. Kavanaugh, Jr., with whom Deborah W. Kirchwey and\nConn, Kavanaugh, Rosenthal, Peisch &amp; Ford, L.L.P. were on brief,\nfor appellee.\n\nJanuary 13, 1999\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant William Mullin\nsued his employer, defendant-appellee Raytheon Company, contending\nthat his demotion (and a concomitant reduction in remuneration)\nconstituted age discrimination in contravention of both the federal\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.  621-634,\nand the Massachusetts Anti-Discrimination Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n151B,  4(1B), (Chapter 151B).  The district court granted\nRaytheon's motion for summary judgment on all counts.  See Mullinv. Raytheon Co., 2 F. Supp.2d 165 (D. Mass. 1998).  Mullin's appeal\nraises, inter alia, a question of first impression in this circuit\nas to the viability of \"disparate impact\" claims in age\ndiscrimination cases.  We conclude that such claims are not\ncognizable under either federal or state law.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nConsistent with the summary judgment standard, we recount\nthe material facts in the manner most congenial to the appellant's\ntheory of the case, accepting his (properly documented) version of\ngenuinely disputed facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in\nhis favor.  See Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 457 (1st\nCir. 1995); Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.\n1990).\nRaytheon assigns salaried employees a labor grade on a\nnumeric scale that ranges from 4 to 18.  Each grade corresponds to\na different (successively higher) earnings bracket.  Prior to\nfiling this action, the appellant worked for Raytheon for some\ntwenty-nine years.  He steadily climbed the corporate lattice.  In\n1979, he achieved a grade of 15 and became manager of manufacturing\noperations for Raytheon's Andover (Massachusetts) plant   a\nposition in which he supervised more than 2,000 employees.  At that\npoint, his upward progression ceased.  Although he retained a grade\n15 classification until 1995, his duties changed and his authority\ngradually contracted.  In 1984, Raytheon transferred Mullin to its\nLowell (Massachusetts) plant, where he became a second-shift\nmanager, supervising some 400 employees.  Beginning in 1989, the\ncompany informally assigned him to the role of trouble-shooter and\ntransferred him from area to area, according to need.  In 1994,\nRaytheon designated him as the manager of the Gyro and Motorwind\nWork Centers at the Lowell plant   a position in which he oversaw\nfewer than 100 subordinates.\nOver the years, Raytheon's principal business has been\nthe manufacture of military ordnance.  When the Cold War ended and\nCongress slashed the Defense Department's procurement budget, the\nvolume of work potentially available to Raytheon decreased\nproportionately.  In an effort to adjust to these economic\nrealities, Raytheon inaugurated major structural changes.  Among\nother steps, it closed the Lowell plant and one in Manchester, New\nHampshire, and folded the operations previously performed at those\nlocations into its Andover plant.  In the process, Raytheon\nrelocated the appellant and his department to Andover.\nIn addition to plant closings and consolidations, the\nretrenchment produced a significant number of layoffs and\nreassignments.   It also included a wage freeze, during which\nRaytheon assayed the commensurability of upper-level salaried\nemployees' assigned labor grades and actual responsibilities.  The\ncompany evaluated each position in light of criteria such as the\ncomplexity of the work undertaken, the number of employees\nsupervised, and the financial responsibility inherent in the job. \nIn the appellant's case, it deemed his grade (15) inconsistent with\nhis duties and downgraded him to level 12   an action that, under\nestablished corporate policy, required a downward compensation\nadjustment to bring him within the salary range that corresponded\nto his new classification.\nClaiming that age discrimination prompted this demotion,\nthe appellant sued.  His complaint, grounded in both federal\nquestion jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1331, and diversity\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1332   Mullin is a citizen of New\nHampshire and Raytheon is a Delaware corporation with its principal\nplace of business in Massachusetts   set out four statements of\nclaim:  two for disparate treatment (one under the ADEA and one\nunder Chapter 151B) and two for disparate impact (one under the\nADEA and one under Chapter 151B). After a period of discovery,\nRaytheon moved for brevis disposition and the district court\nobliged.  See Mullin, 2 F. Supp.2d at 175.  This appeal ensued.\nII.  ANALYSIS\nSummary judgment is a device that \"has proven its\nusefulness as a means of avoiding full-dress trials in unwinnable\ncases, thereby freeing courts to utilize scarce judicial resources\nin more beneficial ways.\"  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d\n816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).  Its essential role is \"to pierce the\nboilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order\nto determine whether trial is actually required.\"  Wynne v. Tufts\nUniv. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992).  The\nmechanics of the device are familiar, see, e.g., Garside, 895 F.2d\nat 48, and do not warrant exegetic description here.  For present\npurposes, it suffices to note that summary judgment should be\ngranted when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n. . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In determining whether these\ncriteria have been satisfied, we, like the trial court, \"must view\nthe entire record in the light most hospitable to the party\nopposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in\nthat party's favor.\"  Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st\nCir. 1990).\nWith this brief preface, we turn to the appellant's\nasseverational array.  In the process, we review the lower court's\ndecision de novo.  See Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.\nA.  Disparate Treatment   ADEA and Chapter 151B Claims.\nThe tripartite burden-shifting regime conceived by the\nSupreme Court for use in Title VII cases, see St. Mary's Honor Ctr.v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-11 (1993); Texas Dep't of Community\nAffairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252-56 (1981); McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973), applies to disparate\ntreatment claims under the ADEA and Chapter 151B.  See, e.g.,\nMesnick, 950 F.2d at 823 (ADEA); Whalen v. NYNEX Info. Resources\nCo., 419 Mass. 792, 795, 647 N.E.2d 716, 718 (1995) (Chapter 151B). \nThe parties concede that the appellant proffered a prima facie case\nand that Raytheon, by citing the cuts in defense spending, the\nattendant need to downsize, and the outcome of the personnel\nreevaluation, articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory\nexplanation both for restructuring and for demoting the appellant. \nThus, the contest here revolves around the third step of the\nMcDonnell Douglas pavane.\nFor purposes of Mullin's ADEA-based disparate treatment\nclaim, we must therefore concentrate on whether he adduced enough\nevidence to create a trialworthy question both as to the employer's\nalleged motivation (animus based on age) and as to the\npretextuality of its explanation for the adverse employment action. \nSee Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823; Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\nCo., 896 F.2d 5, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1990).\nThe appellant's burden under Chapter 151B is somewhat\nless onerous.  While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus\nage animus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of\nthe pavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.  See Blarev. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., 419 Mass. 437, 444-\n46, 646 N.E.2d 111, 116-17 (1995).  The difference between the\nfederal \"pretext-plus\" standard and the Massachusetts \"pretext-\nonly\" standard, though sometimes significant, is irrelevant in this\ncase.  The district court determined that the appellant failed to\nraise a genuine issue as to either pretext or age animus, seeMullin, 2 F. Supp.2d at 172, and, since we agree with the former\ndetermination, the appellant's disparate treatment claims fail\nunder either standard.\nWe need not tarry.  Raytheon advanced a strong,\nobjectively verifiable set of reasons for consolidating operations,\nrestructuring its work force, and downgrading Mullin:  significant\nrevenue loss stemming from massive Defense Department cutbacks,\nculminating in a reevaluation of all upper-echelon salaried\nemployees.  The appellant points to nothing that casts doubt upon\nthe legitimacy of this reason, nor does he proffer any substantial\nevidence that would permit a rational jury to find that Raytheon\nrigged the restructuring in a fashion designed to ensure that the\nappellant's labor grade and/or compensation level would be reduced\nunfairly.  The district court painstakingly analyzed all the\nappellant's submissions in this regard, see id. at 169-71, and it\nwould be pleonastic to rehearse that discussion here.  We content\nourselves with saying that, after having carefully sifted the\nrecord, we uphold the lower court's disposition of the disparate\ntreatment claims for essentially the reasons elucidated in its\nrescript.  See Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co. of Am., 101\nF.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996) (counseling appellate courts not to\nwax longiloquent when a trial court has resolved a claim correctly\nand explained its rationale in a well-reasoned rescript); In re San\nJuan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.\n1993) (similar).\n              B.  Disparate Impact   ADEA.\nThe linchpin of a disparate treatment claim is proof of\nthe employer's discriminatory motive.  See International Bhd. of\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977).  Not so\na claim of disparate impact:  that type of claim is predicated not\non proof of intentional discrimination, but, rather, on proof that\nthe employer utilizes \"employment practices that are facially\nneutral in their treatment of different groups but . . . in fact\nfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified\nby business necessity.\"  Id.  Although the district court skirted\nthe question  whether a disparate impact cause of action lies under\nthe ADEA, see Mullin, 2 F. Supp.2d at 174-75, we take a more direct\nroute.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822 (\"An appellate panel is not\nrestricted to the district court's reasoning but can affirm a\nsummary judgment on any independently sufficient ground.\").\nWe begin by focusing on the statutory language.  SeeLandreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, 471 U.S. 681, 685 (1985).  In\npertinent part, the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer \"to fail\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual's age.\"  29 U.S.C.  623(a)(1).  A\ncommonsense reading of this statement strongly suggests that the\nstatute includes a requirement of intentional discrimination.  SeeEllis v. United Airlines, Inc., 73 F.3d 999, 1007 (10th Cir. 1996)\n(\"It would be a stretch to read the phrase 'because of such\nindividual's age' to prohibit incidental and unintentional\ndiscrimination that resulted because of employment decisions which\nwere made for reasons other than age.\") (emphasis in original). \nHowever, Title VII contains parallel language, and the Supreme\nCourt concluded almost three decades ago that such language\nencompassed a theory of liability based on disparate impact.  SeeGriggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971) (holding that\nTitle VII \"proscribes not only overt discrimination but also\npractices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation\"). \nThe question, then, is whether the ADEA, despite the apparent\nlinguistic inhospitability, also should be read to encompass\ndisparate impact claims.\nCongress enacted the ADEA in 1967.  Prior to 1993,\nseveral courts ruled that the ADEA permitted the maintenance of\ndisparate impact claims.  See, e.g., Finnegan v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 967 F.2d 1161, 1163 (7th Cir. 1992); Maresco v.\nEvans Chemetics, 964 F.2d 106, 115 (2d Cir. 1992); EEOC v.\nBorden's, Inc., 724 F.2d 1390, 1394-95 (9th Cir. 1984); Leftwich v.\nHarris-Stowe State Coll., 702 F.2d 686, 690 (8th Cir. 1983).  All\nof these courts simply assumed that Griggs had settled the issue. \nThe tectonic plates shifted when the Court decided an ADEA case,\nHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604 (1993).  Although Hazen\nPaper involved disparate treatment rather than disparate impact,\nsee id. at 610, language in the majority and concurring opinions\ncaused lower courts to rethink the viability of disparate impact\ndoctrine in the ADEA context.\nWriting for a unanimous Court in Hazen Paper, Justice\nO'Connor declared that \"[d]isparate treatment . . . captures the\nessence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA.\"  Id. at\n610.  Congress passed the ADEA due to \"its concern that older\nworkers were being deprived of employment on the basis of\ninaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.\"  Id.  Consequently, the\nrationale that undergirds the statute is inapposite in instances\nwhere the employment decision is \"wholly motivated by factors other\nthan age, . . . even if the motivating factor is correlated with\nage.\"  Id. at 611.\nThis analysis is telling.  Since disparate impact claims\nencompass the precise scenario that Justice O'Connor describes  \ndisparate impact assigns liability when employment practices are\ngrounded in factors other than the statutorily protected\ncharacteristic (say, age), yet fall more harshly on individuals\nwithin the protected group (say, older persons)   the inescapable\nimplication of her statements is that the imposition of disparate\nimpact liability would not address the evils that Congress was\nattempting to purge when it enacted the ADEA.  Equally as\nimportant, Justice O'Connor's exposition of the purposes\nunderpinning the ADEA sets that statute apart from Title VII (and,\nthus, effectively distinguishes Griggs).  Congress enacted Title\nVII in an effort to equalize employment opportunities for\nindividuals whose employment prospects had been dimmed by past\ndiscriminatory practices.  See Griggs, 401 U.S. at 429-30. \nNeutral, non-essential employment policies that discriminatorily\nimpact protected groups would, if transposed onto such an uneven\nbaseline, exacerbate the preexisting imbalance and countervail the\ncore purpose of Title VII.  Hence, the Court had ample reason to\nconstrue the language of Title VII to bar such practices, when not\njustified by an actual business necessity.  See id. at 431.\nBy contrast, age-based discrimination correlates with\ncontemporaneous employment-related conditions, not past\ndiscriminatory practices.  See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610-12;\nMassachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313\n(1976).  The aging process is inevitable, and Congress was not\ntrying to dissolve those naturally occurring relationships through\nthe medium of the ADEA, but, rather, aimed to protect older workers\nagainst the disparate treatment that resulted from stereotyping\nthem as less productive and therefore less valuable members of the\nwork force because of their advancing years.  This divergence in\npurpose between Title VII and the ADEA counsels convincingly\nagainst mechanistic adherence to Griggs in the ADEA milieu.\nThe concurring opinion in Hazen Paper lends further\nsupport to this conclusion.  In it, Justice Kennedy wrote for\nhimself and two other Justices to underscore that \"nothing in the\nCourt's opinion should be read as incorporating in the ADEA context\nthe so-called 'disparate impact' theory of Title VII.\"  Hazen\nPaper, 507 U.S. at 618 (Kennedy, J. concurring).  \"[T]here are,\" he\nwrote, \"substantial arguments that it is improper to carry over\ndisparate impact analysis from Title VII to the ADEA.\"  Id.\nOther courts also find the arguments to which Justice\nKennedy referred compelling.  Since 1993, a majority of the courts\nof appeals that have addressed the question have held that the ADEA\ndoes not recognize causes of action premised on disparate impact. \nSee Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1007; Lyon v. Ohio Educ. Ass'n &amp; Prof'l Staff\nUnion, 53 F.3d 135, 138-39 (6th Cir. 1995); EEOC v. Francis W.\nParker Sch., 41 F.3d 1073, 1077 (7th Cir. 1994).  The two courts of\nappeals that have held to the contrary have done so in reliance on\npre-Hazen Paper precedents and the law of the circuit doctrine. \nSee District Council 37 v. New York City Dep't of Parks &amp;\nRecreation, 113 F.3d 347, 351 (2d Cir. 1997) (relying on Maresco,\n964 F.2d 106); Houghton v. SIPCO, Inc., 38 F.3d 953, 958-59 (8th\nCir. 1994) (assuming, without any discernible analysis or citation,\nthe availability of disparate impact theory, presumably in light of\nLeftwich, 702 F.2d 686).\nThree additional considerations persuade us that the\nmajority view is correct, that Hazen Paper foretells the future,\nthat Griggs is inapposite in the ADEA context, and that proof of\nintentional discrimination is a prerequisite to liability under the\nADEA.  We touch briefly on each consideration.\n1.  Text and Structure.  A critical asymmetry in the\ntexts of the ADEA and Title VII counsels convincingly against\nrecognizing a disparate impact cause of action under the former\nstatute.  The ADEA stipulates that \"[i]t shall not be unlawful for\nan employer . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited . . .\nwhere the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than\nage.\"  29 U.S.C.  623(f)(1).  This proviso permits employers to\nutilize factors other than age as grounds for employment-related\ndecisions that differentially impact members of the protected class\n(individuals between the ages of 40 and 69).  When this exception\nis read with the ADEA's general prohibition against age-based\ndiscrimination, the resulting construction follows:  it shall be\nunlawful to \"discriminate against any individual . . . because of\nsuch individual's age,\" except when \"based on . . . factors other\nthan age.\"  Thus, if the exception contained in section 623(f)(1)\nis not understood to preclude disparate impact liability, it\nbecomes nothing more than a bromide to the effect that \"only age\ndiscrimination is age discrimination.\"  Such a circular\nconstruction would fly in the teeth of the well-settled canon that\n\"[a]ll words and provisions of statutes are intended to have\nmeaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be\nadopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless,\nredundant or superfluous.\"  United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., 758\nF.2d 741, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985).\nThe Supreme Court's treatment of similar language in the\nEqual Pay Act is instructive on this front.  In County of\nWashington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161 (1981), the Court addressed 42\nU.S.C.  2000e-2(h), a statute that exempts wage differentials\nbetween men and women \"authorized by the provisions of section\n206(d) of Title 29\" from Title VII's general prohibition against\ngender-based discrimination.  Section 206(d), in turn, covers four\ntypes of situations, one of which parallels the exemption found in\nADEA  623(f)(1).  Distilled, this provision allows payment of\ndifferential wages to men and women \"based on any other factor\nother than sex.\"  29 U.S.C.  206(d)(1)(iv).\nFor analytic purposes, the Court juxtaposed this\nlimitation on Equal Pay Act liability with Title VII's broadly\ninclusive prohibition against gender-based discrimination and\ncommented that the limiting language worked to \"confine the\napplication of the Act to wage differentials attributable to sex\ndiscrimination.\"  Gunther, 452 U.S. at 170.  For that reason, the\nJustices concluded that the Equal Pay Act \"has been structured to\npermit employers to defend against charges of discrimination where\ntheir pay differentials are based on a bona fide use of 'other\nfactors other than sex'.\" Id.; see also City of Los Angeles v.\nManhart, 435 U.S. 702, 710 n.20, 713 n.24 (1978) (reasoning that\nthe Equal Pay Act's \"other factors other than sex\" exception\nprecludes liability based on disparities caused by independent\nfactors).  This statement suggests quite forcefully that the\nexception eliminates disparate impact from the armamentarium of\nweapons available to plaintiffs under the Equal Pay Act and,\ncorrespondingly, confines the scope of liability to instances of\nintentional discrimination, that is, to instances of disparate\ntreatment.\nWe believe that the exception found in ADEA  623(f)(1)\neffects a similar limitation on the type of claims that are\npermitted under the ADEA, and that any alternative conclusion would\nbe untenable.  When the ADEA's general prohibition and the\nstatutory exception are read in pari materia, as a unified whole,\nthe prohibition forbids disparate treatment based on age and the\nexception authorizes disparate impact.  Thus, Professor Laycock's\ncommentary, made in the Equal Pay Act context, applies equally to\nthe ADEA:  \"The prohibition and the exception appear identical. \nThe sentence is incomprehensible unless the prohibition forbids\ndisparate treatment and the exception authorizes disparate impact.\" \nDouglas Laycock, Continuing Violations, Disparate Impact in\nCompensation, and Other Title VII Issues, 49 L. &amp; Contemp. Prob.\n53, 55 (1986).\n2.  Legislative History.  The legislative history of the\nADEA provides added support for interpreting it independent of\nTitle VII in regard to disparate impact claims.  When enacted,\nTitle VII included a provision requiring the Secretary of Labor to\nconduct a detailed study on the causes and effects of age\ndiscrimination.  See Pub. L. No. 88-352,  715, 78 Stat. 265\n(1964).  The resulting report, entitled The Older American Worker: \nAge Discrimination in Employment (1965) ( the Report), served as a\nprincipal impetus for the ADEA.  See Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1008.  The\nReport remarked the need for legislation to combat stereotyping and\nto rectify the perception that older persons cannot do particular\njobs.  See Report at 6-11, 21-22.  Conversely, it found \"no\nevidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older\nworker.\"  Id. at 6.  Inasmuch as disparate impact theory is\ndesigned to combat invidious prejudice that is entirely unrelated\nto an ability to perform the job, see Griggs, 401 U.S. at 429-32,\nthe Report's findings suggest that the theory has no utility in age\ndiscrimination cases.\nThe Report also distinguished between \"arbitrary\ndiscrimination\" based on age (disparate treatment) and other\ninstitutional arrangements that have a disproportionate effect on\nolder workers (disparate impact).  Report at 21-25.  It recommended\nthat arbitrary discrimination be statutorily prohibited, but that\nsystemic disadvantages incidentally afflicting older workers be\naddressed through educational programs and institutional\nrestructuring.  See id.; see also Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1008.  The\nReport thus segregated the appropriate remedies for disparate\ntreatment from those for disparate impact.  A fair reading of the\nADEA   the statute that followed hard on the heels of the Report  \nindicates that Congress gave effect to this dichotomy by\nproscribing only intentional discrimination in age cases (while\nrequiring the Secretary to study and develop education and research\nprograms to lessen the negative employment effects that attend the\naging process).  See 29 U.S.C.  622-623; see also Ellis, 73 F.3d\nat 1008.\n3.  The 1991 Amendments.  The third factor that persuades\nus not to emulate the Griggs approach to Title VII in the ADEA\ncontext concerns more recent legislative developments.  In 1991,\nCongress amended Title VII to provide explicitly for causes of\naction based upon disparate impact.  See Pub. L. No. 102-166, \n105, 105 Stat. 1071, 1074-75 (1991).  It simultaneously amended the\nADEA in myriad respects, see, e.g., id. at  115, 105 Stat. at\n1079, but it did not create a corresponding disparate impact cause\nof action.\nWe are mindful that courts ordinarily should tread slowly\nin premising statutory construction on the action (or inaction) of\nsubsequent Congresses.  See Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485\nU.S. 293, 306 (1988).  Still, what transpires in a later\nlegislative session sometimes constitutes a useful source of\nguidance in statutory interpretation cases, see, e.g., Andrus v.\nShell Oil Co., 446 U.S. 657, 666 n.8 (1980); Seatrain Shipbuilding\nCorp. v. Shell Oil Co., 444 U.S. 572, 596 (1980); United States v.\nO'Neil, 11 F.3d 292, 300 (1st Cir. 1993); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 755 n.7 (1st Cir. 1992),\nand we think that the circumstances at hand invite the application\nof that doctrine. Congress' insertion of an express provision for\na disparate impact cause of action in Title VII renders the absence\nof such a provision in the ADEA   which was undergoing revision at\nthe same time by the same committees and in the same bill   highly\nsignificant.  See Richerson v. Jones, 551 F.2d 918, 927-28 (3d Cir.\n1977); cf. General Elec. Co. v. Southern Constr. Co., 383 F.2d 135,\n138 n.4 (5th Cir. 1967).\nIn sum, we have largely analogous statutes that diverge\nstructurally on a discrete but important point.  Coupled with the\nother factors we have discussed, this divergence helps to persuade\nus that Congress never intended to make a disparate impact cause of\naction available under the ADEA.  We fully agree with the Sixth\nCircuit's assessment:  \"The ADEA was not intended to protect older\nworkers from the often harsh economic realities of common business\ndecisions and the hardships associated with corporate\nreorganizations, downsizing, plant closings and relocations.\" \nAllen v. Diebold, Inc., 33 F.3d 674, 677 (6th Cir. 1994).\nTo say more on this point would be supererogatory.  For\nthe foregoing reasons, we join those courts of appeals which have\nheld that the ADEA does not impose liability under a theory of\ndisparate impact.  We therefore affirm the district court's entry\nof summary judgment for Raytheon on the appellant's federal\ndisparate impact claim.\n          C.  Disparate Impact   Chapter 151B.\nWe are left with the appellant's state-law disparate\nimpact claim.  The able district judge noted that Massachusetts has\nyet to determine whether disparate impact is actionable in age\ndiscrimination cases, but disposed of the claim on another ground. \nSee Mullin, 2 F. Supp. 2d at 175.  Consistent with our earlier\napproach, we address the threshold question.\nThe appellant disagrees that the viability of disparate\nimpact theory in age discrimination cases remains unsettled under\nstate law.  He notes that Massachusetts outlaws many types of\ndiscrimination by means of a single, comprehensive statute (Chapter\n151B) and that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) has\nrecognized a disparate impact cause of action with respect to one\ngroup protected by that statute.  See  Cox v. New Engl. Tel. &amp; Tel.\nCo., 414 Mass. 375, 385, 607 N.E.2d 1035, 1041 (1993) (discussing\nhandicap discrimination).  Building on this foundation, the\nappellant reasons that Chapter 151B makes a disparate impact theory\navailable to all groups who fall within its protective carapace.\nAlthough this construct possesses a certain superficial\nappeal, it cannot withstand scrutiny.  Chapter 151B is divided into\nseveral sections and subsections, and the structure of the\nstatutory scheme itself suggests that separate provisions within\nChapter 151B are to be interpreted independently.  Age, for\nexample, is treated separately within the Chapter 151B taxonomy. \nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4(1B).  This is especially\nsignificant because, when the legislature amended Chapter 151B in\n1984, it moved age (which previously had been grouped alongside\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex and ancestry) from\nwithin the compass of section 4(1) and placed it in a separate,\nnewly crafted statutory niche, section 4(1B).  See An Act Relative\nto the Dismissal of Certain Persons from Employment or the Refusal\nto Employ Such Persons Due to Age, 1984 Mass. Acts 631, 632-33. \nThis structural redesign constitutes potent evidence that the\nlegislature meant the two provisions to be distinct and interpreted\nindependently of one another.  Were this not so, there would have\nbeen no need to split section 4(1) in two.\nThe appellant's hypothesis that the Massachusetts courts\nhave cleared disparate impact for use in all instances arising\nunder Chapter 151B (including age discrimination) is flawed in\nanother respect as well; it not only overlooks the structure of the\nstatutory scheme, but also misreads the case law.  As stated, the\nhypothesis rests upon three SJC decisions.  One is Cox, to which we\nsoon shall return.  Neither of the other two is persuasive\nauthority on the point.\nSchool Comm. of Braintree v. MCAD, 377 Mass. 424, 386\nN.E.2d 1251 (1979), was a disparate treatment case that involved\ngender discrimination.  The SJC mentioned disparate treatment and\ndisparate impact as available theories of liability.  See id. at\n429, 386 N.E.2d at 1254.  There is no indication that the court\nintended this passing mention to encompass age discrimination.  In\npoint of fact, the court referred specifically to race, color,\nreligion, sex, and national origin (all protected groups under\nsection 4(1)), but never mentioned age.  See id. at 428, 386 N.E.2d\nat 1254.\nThe appellant's next case, Lynn Teachers Union v. MCAD,\n406 Mass. 515, 549 N.E.2d 97 (1990), also concerned a disparate\ntreatment sex discrimination claim.  The SJC stated in dictum that\n\"[a] prima facie case of employment discrimination can be based on\na theory of disparate impact or disparate treatment.\"  Id. at 526,\n549 N.E.2d at 103.  This dictum is unhelpful for present purposes. \nThe court's focus was on the proper scope of section 4(17)(a), a\nprovision of Chapter 151B that exempts \"bona fide seniority\nsystems\" from the general proscription of Chapter 151B.  Relying in\npart on the fact that section 4(17)(a) had been introduced into\nChapter 151B by way of the 1984 amendments, see 1984 Mass. Acts\n631-33, the court held that the legislature had not intended \"to\nscreen bona fide seniority systems from the scrutiny of all of the\nCommonwealth's antidiscrimination laws.\"  Lynn Teachers, 406 Mass.\nat 525, 549 N.E.2d at 103.  Rather, section 4(17)(a) was directed\nonly to age discrimination claims.  See id.  Thus, Lynn Teacherscontradicts Mullin's hypothesis in two critical aspects:  it\nexemplifies that all forms of discrimination proscribed by Chapter\n151B ought not to be lumped together for interpretive purposes; and\nit illustrates the special way in which the SJC approaches age\ndiscrimination.\nAgainst this backdrop, we find the approach taken by the\nSJC in Cox to be instructive.  Cox dealt with Chapter 151B in the\ncontext of a handicap discrimination claim.  Like age\ndiscrimination, handicap discrimination is governed by a separate\nprovision within Chapter 151B.  See supra note 6.  Recognizing that\nCox presented a question of first impression, the SJC stated that\nit would look for guidance to the federal courts' treatment of\nhandicap discrimination under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973, 29 U.S.C.  794.  See Cox, 414 Mass. at 382, 607 N.E.2d at\n1039.  Declaring that there was \"no reason to construe the\nCommonwealth's law differently\" than its federal counterpart, the\nSJC then followed federal precedents holding disparate impact\nactionable under section 504.  See id. at 390, 607 N.E.2d at 1043-\n44; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 297 n.17 (1985)\n(collecting federal cases).\nCox epitomizes the SJC's general approach in such\nmatters, see, e.g., White v. University of Mass. at Boston, 410\nMass. 553, 557, 574 N.E.2d 356, 358 (1991) (\"The analysis of a\ndiscrimination claim is essentially the same under the State and\nFederal statutes.\"), and thus offers a window on the SJC's handling\nof Chapter 151B.  It confirms our intuition that the SJC will\ninterpret separate provisions of the statute independently. \nMoreover, Cox also shows that, when confronted with employment\ndiscrimination claims of novel impression, the SJC tends to rely on\nfederal court interpretations of analogous federal statutes. \nAccord Vasys v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 387 Mass. 51, 54, 438\nN.E.2d 836, 839 (1982) (\"When the Legislature, in enacting a\nstatute, adopts the language of a Federal statute, we will\nordinarily construe the Massachusetts statute in accordance with\nthe construction given the cognate Federal statute by the Federal\ncourts.\"); Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609,\n611, 405 N.E.2d 106, 108 (1980) (similar).\nWe rule, therefore, that Cox, fairly read, does not\njustify an inference that the SJC, by recognizing disparate impact\nclaims in terms of handicap discrimination, intended to transplant\nthe theory into the age discrimination milieu.  It follows that \nthe SJC has not yet staked out a position in regard to the\nviability of age discrimination claims grounded in disparate\nimpact.  Because state law is inscrutable in this regard, \"it\nbecomes our duty to vaticinate how the state's highest tribunal\nwould resolve matters.\"  Moores v. Greenberg, 834 F.2d 1105, 1107\n(1st Cir. 1987).  In that process, \"we may seek inspiration from .\n. . analogous state court decisions.\"  Kathios v. General Motors\nCorp., 862 F.2d 944, 949 (1st Cir. 1988).\nHere, we adopt the Cox court's approach.  The\nMassachusetts age discrimination prohibition and the federal age\ndiscrimination prohibition are substantially identical, compareMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 151B,  4(1B), with 29 U.S.C.  623(a)(1),\nand, as said, the public policy concerns implicated by age\ndiscrimination are distinct from the concerns created by other\nforms of discrimination.  Under these circumstances, we conclude\nthat, when faced with the question, the SJC likely will look to the\nfederal courts' interpretation of the ADEA and hold that an age\ndiscrimination claim cannot be grounded solely on a theory of\ndisparate impact.  Accordingly, we sustain the district court's\nrejection of the appellant's remaining claim.\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nWe need go no further.  Concluding, as we do, that the\nlower court appropriately granted summary judgment in Raytheon's\nfavor on all four of Mullin's statements of claim, we affirm the\njudgment below.\n\nAffirmed.\n",

Mullin's appeal\nraises, inter alia, a question of first impression in this circuit\nas to the viability of \"disparate impact\" claims in age\ndiscrimination cases.  We conclude that such claims are not\ncognizable under either federal or state law.\nI.  BACKGROUND\nConsistent with the summary judgment standard, we recount\nthe material facts in the manner most congenial to the appellant's\ntheory of the case, accepting his (properly documented) version of\ngenuinely disputed facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in\nhis favor.  See Coyne v.

Osco Drug, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (1st Cir.\n1990).\nRaytheon assigns salaried employees a labor grade on a\nnumeric scale that ranges from 4 to 18.  Each grade corresponds to\na different (successively higher) earnings bracket.  Prior to\nfiling this action, the appellant worked for Raytheon for some\ntwenty-nine years.  He steadily climbed the corporate lattice.  In\n1979, he achieved a grade of 15 and became manager of manufacturing\noperations for Raytheon's Andover (Massachusetts) plant   a\nposition in which he supervised more than 2,000 employees.  At that\npoint, his upward progression ceased.  Although he retained a grade\n15 classification until 1995, his duties changed and his authority\ngradually contracted.  In 1984, Raytheon transferred Mullin to its\nLowell (Massachusetts) plant, where he became a second-shift\nmanager, supervising some 400 employees.  Beginning in 1989, the\ncompany informally assigned him to the role of trouble-shooter and\ntransferred him from area to area, according to need.  In 1994,\nRaytheon designated him as the manager of the Gyro and Motorwind\nWork Centers at the Lowell plant   a position in which he oversaw\nfewer than 100 subordinates.\nOver the years, Raytheon's principal business has been\nthe manufacture of military ordnance.  When the Cold War ended and\nCongress slashed the Defense Department's procurement budget, the\nvolume of work potentially available to Raytheon decreased\nproportionately.  In an effort to adjust to these economic\nrealities, Raytheon inaugurated major structural changes.  Among\nother steps, it closed the Lowell plant and one in Manchester, New\nHampshire, and folded the operations previously performed at those\nlocations into its Andover plant.  In the process, Raytheon\nrelocated the appellant and his department to Andover.\nIn addition to plant closings and consolidations, the\nretrenchment produced a significant number of layoffs and\nreassignments.   It also included a wage freeze, during which\nRaytheon assayed the commensurability of upper-level salaried\nemployees' assigned labor grades and actual responsibilities.  The\ncompany evaluated each position in light of criteria such as the\ncomplexity of the work undertaken, the number of employees\nsupervised, and the financial responsibility inherent in the job. \nIn the appellant's case, it deemed his grade (15) inconsistent with\nhis duties and downgraded him to level 12   an action that, under\nestablished corporate policy, required a downward compensation\nadjustment to bring him within the salary range that corresponded\nto his new classification.\nClaiming that age discrimination prompted this demotion,\nthe appellant sued.  His complaint, grounded in both federal\nquestion jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1331, and diversity\njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1332   Mullin is a citizen of New\nHampshire and Raytheon is a Delaware corporation with its principal\nplace of business in Massachusetts   set out four statements of\nclaim:  two for disparate treatment (one under the ADEA and one\nunder Chapter 151B) and two for disparate impact (one under the\nADEA and one under Chapter 151B). After a period of discovery,\nRaytheon moved for brevis disposition and the district court\nobliged.  See Mullin, 2 F. Supp.2d at 175.  This appeal ensued.\nII.  ANALYSIS\nSummary judgment is a device that \"has proven its\nusefulness as a means of avoiding full-dress trials in unwinnable\ncases, thereby freeing courts to utilize scarce judicial resources\nin more beneficial ways.\"  Mesnick v.

Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).  Its essential role is \"to pierce the\nboilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order\nto determine whether trial is actually required.\"  Wynne v. Tufts\nUniv.

The\nmechanics of the device are familiar, see, e.g., Garside, 895 F.2d\nat 48, and do not warrant exegetic description here.  For present\npurposes, it suffices to note that summary judgment should be\ngranted when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n. . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  In determining whether these\ncriteria have been satisfied, we, like the trial court, \"must view\nthe entire record in the light most hospitable to the party\nopposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in\nthat party's favor.\"  Griggs-Ryan v.

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536516\"><a href=\"/opinion/536516/52-fair-emplpraccas-253-52-empl-prac-dec-p-39659-jose-medina-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1990).\nThe appellant's burden under Chapter 151B is somewhat\nless onerous.  While federal law requires a showing of pretext plus\nage animus, the Massachusetts courts appear, at the third step of\nthe pavane, to require a claimant to show only pretext.  See Blarev. Husky Injection Molding Sys. Boston, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">437</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444-\n46, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">646</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116-17 (1995).  The difference between the\nfederal \"pretext-plus\" standard and the Massachusetts \"pretext-\nonly\" standard, though sometimes significant, is irrelevant in this\ncase.  The district court determined that the appellant failed to\nraise a genuine issue as to either pretext or age animus, seeMullin, 2 F. Supp.2d at 172, and, since we agree with the former\ndetermination, the appellant's disparate treatment claims fail\nunder either standard.\nWe need not tarry.  Raytheon advanced a strong,\nobjectively verifiable set of reasons for consolidating operations,\nrestructuring its work force, and downgrading Mullin:  significant\nrevenue loss stemming from massive Defense Department cutbacks,\nculminating in a reevaluation of all upper-echelon salaried\nemployees.  The appellant points to nothing that casts doubt upon\nthe legitimacy of this reason, nor does he proffer any substantial\nevidence that would permit a rational jury to find that Raytheon\nrigged the restructuring in a fashion designed to ensure that the\nappellant's labor grade and/or compensation level would be reduced\nunfairly.  The district court painstakingly analyzed all the\nappellant's submissions in this regard, see id. at 169-71, and it\nwould be pleonastic to rehearse that discussion here.  We content\nourselves with saying that, after having carefully sifted the\nrecord, we uphold the lower court's disposition of the disparate\ntreatment claims for essentially the reasons elucidated in its\nrescript.

Disparate Impact   ADEA.\nThe linchpin of a disparate treatment claim is proof of\nthe employer's discriminatory motive.  See International Bhd. of\nTeamsters v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 n.15 (1977).  Not so\na claim of disparate impact:  that type of claim is predicated not\non proof of intentional discrimination, but, rather, on proof that\nthe employer utilizes \"employment practices that are facially\nneutral in their treatment of different groups but . . . in fact\nfall more harshly on one group than another and cannot be justified\nby business necessity.\"  Id.  Although the district court skirted\nthe question  whether a disparate impact cause of action lies under\nthe ADEA, see Mullin, 2 F. Supp.2d at 174-75, we take a more direct\nroute.  See Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 822 (\"An appellate panel is not\nrestricted to the district court's reasoning but can affirm a\nsummary judgment on any independently sufficient ground.\").\nWe begin by focusing on the statutory language.

In\npertinent part, the ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer \"to fail\nor refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual's age.\"  29 U.S.C.  623(a)(1).  A\ncommonsense reading of this statement strongly suggests that the\nstatute includes a requirement of intentional discrimination.  SeeEllis v.

All\nof these courts simply assumed that Griggs had settled the issue. \nThe tectonic plates shifted when the Court decided an ADEA case,\nHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112844\"><a href=\"/opinion/112844/hazen-paper-co-v-biggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).  Although Hazen\nPaper involved disparate treatment rather than disparate impact,\nsee id. at 610, language in the majority and concurring opinions\ncaused lower courts to rethink the viability of disparate impact\ndoctrine in the ADEA context.\nWriting for a unanimous Court in Hazen Paper, Justice\nO'Connor declared that \"[d]isparate treatment . . . captures the\nessence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA.\"  Id. at\n610.  Congress passed the ADEA due to \"its concern that older\nworkers were being deprived of employment on the basis of\ninaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.\"  Id.  Consequently, the\nrationale that undergirds the statute is inapposite in instances\nwhere the employment decision is \"wholly motivated by factors other\nthan age, . . . even if the motivating factor is correlated with\nage.\"  Id. at 611.\nThis analysis is telling.  Since disparate impact claims\nencompass the precise scenario that Justice O'Connor describes  \ndisparate impact assigns liability when employment practices are\ngrounded in factors other than the statutorily protected\ncharacteristic (say, age), yet fall more harshly on individuals\nwithin the protected group (say, older persons)   the inescapable\nimplication of her statements is that the imposition of disparate\nimpact liability would not address the evils that Congress was\nattempting to purge when it enacted the ADEA.  Equally as\nimportant, Justice O'Connor's exposition of the purposes\nunderpinning the ADEA sets that statute apart from Title VII (and,\nthus, effectively distinguishes Griggs).  Congress enacted Title\nVII in an effort to equalize employment opportunities for\nindividuals whose employment prospects had been dimmed by past\ndiscriminatory practices.  See Griggs, 401 U.S. at 429-30. \nNeutral, non-essential employment policies that discriminatorily\nimpact protected groups would, if transposed onto such an uneven\nbaseline, exacerbate the preexisting imbalance and countervail the\ncore purpose of Title VII.  Hence, the Court had ample reason to\nconstrue the language of Title VII to bar such practices, when not\njustified by an actual business necessity.  See id. at 431.\nBy contrast, age-based discrimination correlates with\ncontemporaneous employment-related conditions, not past\ndiscriminatory practices.  See Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 610-12;\nMassachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109515\"><a href=\"/opinion/109515/massachusetts-bd-of-retirement-v-murgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313\n(1976).  The aging process is inevitable, and Congress was not\ntrying to dissolve those naturally occurring relationships through\nthe medium of the ADEA, but, rather, aimed to protect older workers\nagainst the disparate treatment that resulted from stereotyping\nthem as less productive and therefore less valuable members of the\nwork force because of their advancing years.  This divergence in\npurpose between Title VII and the ADEA counsels convincingly\nagainst mechanistic adherence to Griggs in the ADEA milieu.\nThe concurring opinion in Hazen Paper lends further\nsupport to this conclusion.  In it, Justice Kennedy wrote for\nhimself and two other Justices to underscore that \"nothing in the\nCourt's opinion should be read as incorporating in the ADEA context\nthe so-called 'disparate impact' theory of Title VII.\"  Hazen\nPaper, 507 U.S. at 618 (Kennedy, J. concurring).  \"[T]here are,\" he\nwrote, \"substantial arguments that it is improper to carry over\ndisparate impact analysis from Title VII to the ADEA.\"  Id.\nOther courts also find the arguments to which Justice\nKennedy referred compelling.  Since 1993, a majority of the courts\nof appeals that have addressed the question have held that the ADEA\ndoes not recognize causes of action premised on disparate impact. \nSee Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1007; Lyon v.

We touch briefly on each consideration.\n1.  Text and Structure.  A critical asymmetry in the\ntexts of the ADEA and Title VII counsels convincingly against\nrecognizing a disparate impact cause of action under the former\nstatute.  The ADEA stipulates that \"[i]t shall not be unlawful for\nan employer . . . to take any action otherwise prohibited . . .\nwhere the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than\nage.\"  29 U.S.C.  623(f)(1).  This proviso permits employers to\nutilize factors other than age as grounds for employment-related\ndecisions that differentially impact members of the protected class\n(individuals between the ages of 40 and 69).  When this exception\nis read with the ADEA's general prohibition against age-based\ndiscrimination, the resulting construction follows:  it shall be\nunlawful to \"discriminate against any individual . . . because of\nsuch individual's age,\" except when \"based on . . . factors other\nthan age.\"  Thus, if the exception contained in section 623(f)(1)\nis not understood to preclude disparate impact liability, it\nbecomes nothing more than a bromide to the effect that \"only age\ndiscrimination is age discrimination.\"  Such a circular\nconstruction would fly in the teeth of the well-settled canon that\n\"[a]ll words and provisions of statutes are intended to have\nmeaning and are to be given effect, and no construction should be\nadopted which would render statutory words or phrases meaningless,\nredundant or superfluous.\"  United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450368\"><a href=\"/opinion/450368/united-states-v-ven-fuel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751-52 (1st Cir. 1985).\nThe Supreme Court's treatment of similar language in the\nEqual Pay Act is instructive on this front.  In County of\nWashington v. Gunther, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110512\"><a href=\"/opinion/110512/county-of-washington-v-gunther/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981), the Court addressed 42\nU.S.C.  2000e-2(h), a statute that exempts wage differentials\nbetween men and women \"authorized by the provisions of section\n206(d) of Title 29\" from Title VII's general prohibition against\ngender-based discrimination.  Section 206(d), in turn, covers four\ntypes of situations, one of which parallels the exemption found in\nADEA  623(f)(1).  Distilled, this provision allows payment of\ndifferential wages to men and women \"based on any other factor\nother than sex.\"  29 U.S.C.  206(d)(1)(iv).\nFor analytic purposes, the Court juxtaposed this\nlimitation on Equal Pay Act liability with Title VII's broadly\ninclusive prohibition against gender-based discrimination and\ncommented that the limiting language worked to \"confine the\napplication of the Act to wage differentials attributable to sex\ndiscrimination.\"  Gunther, 452 U.S. at 170.  For that reason, the\nJustices concluded that the Equal Pay Act \"has been structured to\npermit employers to defend against charges of discrimination where\ntheir pay differentials are based on a bona fide use of 'other\nfactors other than sex'.\" Id.; see also City of Los Angeles v.\nManhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109834\"><a href=\"/opinion/109834/los-angeles-dept-of-water-and-power-v-manhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 710 n.20, 713 n.24 (1978) (reasoning that\nthe Equal Pay Act's \"other factors other than sex\" exception\nprecludes liability based on disparities caused by independent\nfactors).  This statement suggests quite forcefully that the\nexception eliminates disparate impact from the armamentarium of\nweapons available to plaintiffs under the Equal Pay Act and,\ncorrespondingly, confines the scope of liability to instances of\nintentional discrimination, that is, to instances of disparate\ntreatment.\nWe believe that the exception found in ADEA  623(f)(1)\neffects a similar limitation on the type of claims that are\npermitted under the ADEA, and that any alternative conclusion would\nbe untenable.  When the ADEA's general prohibition and the\nstatutory exception are read in pari materia, as a unified whole,\nthe prohibition forbids disparate treatment based on age and the\nexception authorizes disparate impact.  Thus, Professor Laycock's\ncommentary, made in the Equal Pay Act context, applies equally to\nthe ADEA:  \"The prohibition and the exception appear identical. \nThe sentence is incomprehensible unless the prohibition forbids\ndisparate treatment and the exception authorizes disparate impact.\" \nDouglas Laycock, Continuing Violations, Disparate Impact in\nCompensation, and Other Title VII Issues, 49 L. &amp; Contemp. Prob.\n53, 55 (1986).\n2.  Legislative History.  The legislative history of the\nADEA provides added support for interpreting it independent of\nTitle VII in regard to disparate impact claims.  When enacted,\nTitle VII included a provision requiring the Secretary of Labor to\nconduct a detailed study on the causes and effects of age\ndiscrimination.  See Pub. L. No. 88-352,  715, 78 Stat. 265\n(1964).  The resulting report, entitled The Older American Worker: \nAge Discrimination in Employment (1965) ( the Report), served as a\nprincipal impetus for the ADEA.  See Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1008.  The\nReport remarked the need for legislation to combat stereotyping and\nto rectify the perception that older persons cannot do particular\njobs.  See Report at 6-11, 21-22.  Conversely, it found \"no\nevidence of prejudice based on dislike or intolerance of the older\nworker.\"  Id. at 6.  Inasmuch as disparate impact theory is\ndesigned to combat invidious prejudice that is entirely unrelated\nto an ability to perform the job, see Griggs, 401 U.S. at 429-32,\nthe Report's findings suggest that the theory has no utility in age\ndiscrimination cases.\nThe Report also distinguished between \"arbitrary\ndiscrimination\" based on age (disparate treatment) and other\ninstitutional arrangements that have a disproportionate effect on\nolder workers (disparate impact).  Report at 21-25.  It recommended\nthat arbitrary discrimination be statutorily prohibited, but that\nsystemic disadvantages incidentally afflicting older workers be\naddressed through educational programs and institutional\nrestructuring.  See id.; see also Ellis, 73 F.3d at 1008.  The\nReport thus segregated the appropriate remedies for disparate\ntreatment from those for disparate impact.  A fair reading of the\nADEA   the statute that followed hard on the heels of the Report  \nindicates that Congress gave effect to this dichotomy by\nproscribing only intentional discrimination in age cases (while\nrequiring the Secretary to study and develop education and research\nprograms to lessen the negative employment effects that attend the\naging process).  See 29 U.S.C.  622-623; see also Ellis, 73 F.3d\nat 1008.\n3.  The 1991 Amendments.  The third factor that persuades\nus not to emulate the Griggs approach to Title VII in the ADEA\ncontext concerns more recent legislative developments.  In 1991,\nCongress amended Title VII to provide explicitly for causes of\naction based upon disparate impact.  See Pub. L. No. 102-166, \n105, 105 Stat. 1071, 1074-75 (1991).  It simultaneously amended the\nADEA in myriad respects, see, e.g., id. at  115, 105 Stat. at\n1079, but it did not create a corresponding disparate impact cause\nof action.\nWe are mindful that courts ordinarily should tread slowly\nin premising statutory construction on the action (or inaction) of\nsubsequent Congresses.  See Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112026\"><a href=\"/opinion/112026/schneidewind-v-anr-pipeline-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306 (1988).  Still, what transpires in a later\nlegislative session sometimes constitutes a useful source of\nguidance in statutory interpretation cases, see, e.g., Andrus v.\nShell Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110271\"><a href=\"/opinion/110271/andrus-v-shell-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">657</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 n.8 (1980); Seatrain Shipbuilding\nCorp. v.

Congress' insertion of an express provision for\na disparate impact cause of action in Title VII renders the absence\nof such a provision in the ADEA   which was undergoing revision at\nthe same time by the same committees and in the same bill   highly\nsignificant.  See Richerson v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"344167\"><a href=\"/opinion/344167/dionysius-richerson-in-no-76-1762-v-captain-gerald-r-jones-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927-28 (3d Cir.\n1977); cf.

Coupled with the\nother factors we have discussed, this divergence helps to persuade\nus that Congress never intended to make a disparate impact cause of\naction available under the ADEA.  We fully agree with the Sixth\nCircuit's assessment:  \"The ADEA was not intended to protect older\nworkers from the often harsh economic realities of common business\ndecisions and the hardships associated with corporate\nreorganizations, downsizing, plant closings and relocations.\" \nAllen v.

For\nthe foregoing reasons, we join those courts of appeals which have\nheld that the ADEA does not impose liability under a theory of\ndisparate impact.  We therefore affirm the district court's entry\nof summary judgment for Raytheon on the appellant's federal\ndisparate impact claim.\n          C.  Disparate Impact   Chapter 151B.\nWe are left with the appellant's state-law disparate\nimpact claim.  The able district judge noted that Massachusetts has\nyet to determine whether disparate impact is actionable in age\ndiscrimination cases, but disposed of the claim on another ground. \nSee Mullin, 2 F. Supp. 2d at 175.  Consistent with our earlier\napproach, we address the threshold question.\nThe appellant disagrees that the viability of disparate\nimpact theory in age discrimination cases remains unsettled under\nstate law.  He notes that Massachusetts outlaws many types of\ndiscrimination by means of a single, comprehensive statute (Chapter\n151B) and that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) has\nrecognized a disparate impact cause of action with respect to one\ngroup protected by that statute.  See  Cox v. New Engl. Tel. &amp; Tel.\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092725\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092725/cox-v-new-england-telephone-telegraph-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092725\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092725/cox-v-new-england-telephone-telegraph-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1041 (1993) (discussing\nhandicap discrimination).  Building on this foundation, the\nappellant reasons that Chapter 151B makes a disparate impact theory\navailable to all groups who fall within its protective carapace.\nAlthough this construct possesses a certain superficial\nappeal, it cannot withstand scrutiny.  Chapter 151B is divided into\nseveral sections and subsections, and the structure of the\nstatutory scheme itself suggests that separate provisions within\nChapter 151B are to be interpreted independently.  Age, for\nexample, is treated separately within the Chapter 151B taxonomy. \nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B,  4(1B).  This is especially\nsignificant because, when the legislature amended Chapter 151B in\n1984, it moved age (which previously had been grouped alongside\nrace, color, religion, national origin, sex and ancestry) from\nwithin the compass of section 4(1) and placed it in a separate,\nnewly crafted statutory niche, section 4(1B).  See An Act Relative\nto the Dismissal of Certain Persons from Employment or the Refusal\nto Employ Such Persons Due to Age, 1984 Mass. Acts 631, 632-33. \nThis structural redesign constitutes potent evidence that the\nlegislature meant the two provisions to be distinct and interpreted\nindependently of one another.  Were this not so, there would have\nbeen no need to split section 4(1) in two.\nThe appellant's hypothesis that the Massachusetts courts\nhave cleared disparate impact for use in all instances arising\nunder Chapter 151B (including age discrimination) is flawed in\nanother respect as well; it not only overlooks the structure of the\nstatutory scheme, but also misreads the case law.  As stated, the\nhypothesis rests upon three SJC decisions.  One is Cox, to which we\nsoon shall return.  Neither of the other two is persuasive\nauthority on the point.\nSchool Comm. of Braintree v. MCAD, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066542\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066542/school-comm-of-braintree-v-mass-comm-against-dis/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066542\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066542/school-comm-of-braintree-v-mass-comm-against-dis/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), was a disparate treatment case that involved\ngender discrimination.  The SJC mentioned disparate treatment and\ndisparate impact as available theories of liability.  See id. at\n429, 386 N.E.2d at 1254.  There is no indication that the court\nintended this passing mention to encompass age discrimination.  In\npoint of fact, the court referred specifically to race, color,\nreligion, sex, and national origin (all protected groups under\nsection 4(1)), but never mentioned age.  See id. at 428, 386 N.E.2d\nat 1254.\nThe appellant's next case, Lynn Teachers Union v. MCAD,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230540/lynn-tchr-ul-1037-v-mass-comm-against-discrim/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230540\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230540/lynn-tchr-ul-1037-v-mass-comm-against-discrim/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), also concerned a disparate\ntreatment sex discrimination claim.  The SJC stated in dictum that\n\"[a] prima facie case of employment discrimination can be based on\na theory of disparate impact or disparate treatment.\"  Id. at 526,\n549 N.E.2d at 103.  This dictum is unhelpful for present purposes. \nThe court's focus was on the proper scope of section 4(17)(a), a\nprovision of Chapter 151B that exempts \"bona fide seniority\nsystems\" from the general proscription of Chapter 151B.  Relying in\npart on the fact that section 4(17)(a) had been introduced into\nChapter 151B by way of the 1984 amendments, see 1984 Mass. Acts\n631-33, the court held that the legislature had not intended \"to\nscreen bona fide seniority systems from the scrutiny of all of the\nCommonwealth's antidiscrimination laws.\"  Lynn Teachers, 406 Mass.\nat 525, 549 N.E.2d at 103.  Rather, section 4(17)(a) was directed\nonly to age discrimination claims.  See id.  Thus, Lynn Teacherscontradicts Mullin's hypothesis in two critical aspects:  it\nexemplifies that all forms of discrimination proscribed by Chapter\n151B ought not to be lumped together for interpretive purposes; and\nit illustrates the special way in which the SJC approaches age\ndiscrimination.\nAgainst this backdrop, we find the approach taken by the\nSJC in Cox to be instructive.  Cox dealt with Chapter 151B in the\ncontext of a handicap discrimination claim.  Like age\ndiscrimination, handicap discrimination is governed by a separate\nprovision within Chapter 151B.  See supra note 6.  Recognizing that\nCox presented a question of first impression, the SJC stated that\nit would look for guidance to the federal courts' treatment of\nhandicap discrimination under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\nof 1973, 29 U.S.C.  794.  See Cox, 414 Mass. at 382, 607 N.E.2d at\n1039.  Declaring that there was \"no reason to construe the\nCommonwealth's law differently\" than its federal counterpart, the\nSJC then followed federal precedents holding disparate impact\nactionable under section 504.  See id. at 390, 607 N.E.2d at 1043-\n44; see also Alexander v. Choate, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297 n.17 (1985)\n(collecting federal cases).\nCox epitomizes the SJC's general approach in such\nmatters, see, e.g., White v. University of Mass. at Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239048\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239048/white-v-university-of-massachusetts-at-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 557, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2239048\"><a href=\"/opinion/2239048/white-v-university-of-massachusetts-at-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358 (1991) (\"The analysis of a\ndiscrimination claim is essentially the same under the State and\nFederal statutes.\"), and thus offers a window on the SJC's handling\nof Chapter 151B.  It confirms our intuition that the SJC will\ninterpret separate provisions of the statute independently. \nMoreover, Cox also shows that, when confronted with employment\ndiscrimination claims of novel impression, the SJC tends to rely on\nfederal court interpretations of analogous federal statutes. \nAccord Vasys v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102994\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102994/vasys-v-metropolitan-district-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102994\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102994/vasys-v-metropolitan-district-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (1982) (\"When the Legislature, in enacting a\nstatute, adopts the language of a Federal statute, we will\nordinarily construe the Massachusetts statute in accordance with\nthe construction given the cognate Federal statute by the Federal\ncourts.\"); Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. v. Cheney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066007\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066007/packaging-industries-group-inc-v-cheney/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n611, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2066007\"><a href=\"/opinion/2066007/packaging-industries-group-inc-v-cheney/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 (1980) (similar).\nWe rule, therefore, that Cox, fairly read, does not\njustify an inference that the SJC, by recognizing disparate impact\nclaims in terms of handicap discrimination, intended to transplant\nthe theory into the age discrimination milieu.  It follows that \nthe SJC has not yet staked out a position in regard to the\nviability of age discrimination claims grounded in disparate\nimpact.  Because state law is inscrutable in this regard, \"it\nbecomes our duty to vaticinate how the state's highest tribunal\nwould resolve matters.\"  Moores v. Greenberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498384\"><a href=\"/opinion/498384/ralph-w-moores-jr-v-nathan-greenberg-ralph-w-moores-jr-v-nathan/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1107\n(1st Cir. 1987).  In that process, \"we may seek inspiration from .\n. . analogous state court decisions.\"  Kathios v. General Motors\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515447\"><a href=\"/opinion/515447/dennis-kathios-v-general-motors-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 949 (1st Cir. 1988).\nHere, we adopt the Cox court's approach.  The\nMassachusetts age discrimination prohibition and the federal age\ndiscrimination prohibition are substantially identical, compareMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 151B,  4(1B), with 29 U.S.C.  623(a)(1),\nand, as said, the public policy concerns implicated by age\ndiscrimination are distinct from the concerns created by other\nforms of discrimination.  Under these circumstances, we conclude\nthat, when faced with the question, the SJC likely will look to the\nfederal courts' interpretation of the ADEA and hold that an age\ndiscrimination claim cannot be grounded solely on a theory of\ndisparate impact.  Accordingly, we sustain the district court's\nrejection of the appellant's remaining claim.\nIII.  CONCLUSION\nWe need go no further.  Concluding, as we do, that the\nlower court appropriately granted summary judgment in Raytheon's\nfavor on all four of Mullin's statements of claim, we affirm the\njudgment below.\n\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
