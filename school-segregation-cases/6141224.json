A jury\n\nawarded damages of $4 million for each child. We affirm.\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/2\n\n\n                                      FACTS\n\n       Sisters C.L. and S.L. were born in 1996 and 2000, respectively. As young\n\nchildren, they lived with their mother in Everett. Their father was incarcerated out\n\nof state. Child Protective Services received reports that the girls' mother was\n\nusing drugs and was abusive and neglectful. The girls were removed from her\n\ncare in 2002 and were found dependent.\n\n       C.L. and S.L. lived in various foster homes, including one placement with\n\nsome friends of Benjamin and Carolyn Lange. The Langes decided to apply for a\n\nfoster license specifically so that they could be a placement for the two girls. The\n\nLanges had three biological sons, born in 1987, 1989, and 1992. The application\n\nasked,\"Have you, or anyone in your family, been sexually or physically abused?\n\nAnd, have you or anyone in your family been a perpetrator or had a restraining\n\norder or protective order filed?\" The Langes disclosed that their middle son,\n\nDillon, had been \"sexually abused by an older girl (with a history of abuse)\"\n\nduring school hours when he was in kindergarten and first grade. They said\n\nDillon had received counseling \"and is ok now.\"\n\n       The Langes did not disclose that Dillon was also an alleged perpetrator of\n\nsexual abuse. The department had in its files a referral to Child Protective\n\nServices concerning an incident in 2001, when Dillon was 12. According to the\n\nintake report, Dillon's 12-year-old cousin walked into a room and saw Dillon put\n\nhis penis into the rectum of a 5-year-old cousin. The incident was reported to law\n\nenforcement for investigation. The officers who investigated the accusation\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/3\n\n\nagainst Dillon reported they were unable to establish probable cause because\n\nneither Dillon nor the younger boy admitted to sexual conduct.\n\n       The social worker responsible for reviewing the Langes'foster application\n\ndid not discover the 2001 referral concerning Dillon. The State issued a license\n\nto the Langes in December 2002 and placed the girls in the Lange home in June\n\n2003. Social workers who checked up on the girls documented positive\n\nobservations about their assimilation into the Lange family. The girls reportedly\n\nappeared bonded with Benjamin, Carolyn, and the three boys.\n\n       In late 2003, the State terminated the rights of the girls' biological parents.\n\nThe Langes expressed interest in adoption.\n\n       The department was required to complete a preplacement report making a\n\nrecommendation as to the fitness of the prospective adopters based on their\n\n\"home environment, family life, health, facilities, and resources.\" Former\n\nRCW 26.33.190(2)(1991). Social worker Helen Anderson completed a\n\npreplacement report on the Langes. The report mentions that Dillon was\n\nmolested. It does not mention that Dillon allegedly molested his cousin because\n\nAnderson did not see the 2001 intake report when gathering information on the\n\nLanges, although she admitted in a deposition that she should have. Her\n\npreplacement report states that background checks on Carolyn, Benjamin, and\n\ntheir oldest son did not reveal any disqualifying information. Anderson\n\nrecommended that the adoptions go forward.\n\n       The department was also required to complete a postplacement report\n\nbefore the adoption was finalized. RCW 26.33.200(1). The postplacement\n\n\n                                          3\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/4\n\n\nreports referred to the preplacernent reports and concluded that the Lange home\n\nwas adequate. A court approved the adoptions on August 24, 2004.\n\n       Around this time, the two younger boys—Dillon and Co!ten Lange—began\n\nto subject the girls to sexual abuse. C.L. testified that Dillon began molesting her\n\nwhen she was 8 and he was around 14. She said Dillon would come into her\n\nroom at night, undress her, and touch her breasts and vagina with his hands,\n\npenis, and mouth. She said that this occurred on a regular basis until she was\n\n12, that Colten regularly abused her during the same timeframe, and that both\n\nboys at times put their penises in her mouth. S.L. testified to similar experiences\n\nwith Dillon from when she was 6 or 7 until she was 11, and at least once with\n\nCo!ten. She said if she told Dillon to stop, he would cover her mouth or choke\n\nher, and would threaten to kill her if she told anyone.\n\n       C.L. testified that she told Carolyn about the sexual abuse in 2011.\n\nCarolyn \"didn't believe\" C.L. and told her that if anything had happened, she \"just\n\nneeded to forgive\" her brothers.\n\n       In August 2013, C.L. told her friend and her friend's mother about the\n\nsexual abuse. They contacted Child Protective Services. C.L. did not go back to\n\nthe Lange home. The State removed S.L. from the Lange home in November\n\n2013. During the ensuing police investigation, Co!ten confessed to having sexual\n\ncontact with the girls. Dillon confessed to some of the allegations.\n\n      This lawsuit was filed on December 31, 2014, alleging the department's\n\nnegligence in screening the background of the Lange family before facilitating the\n\nplacement and adoption of the girls by the Langes. The complaint particularly\n\n\n                                         4\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/5\n\n\nalleged that the department facilitated the adoption despite having information\n\nthat Dillon had been accused of having anal intercourse with his younger cousin.\n\nThe department's answer denied liability and stated numerous affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n       Trial was set for January 2016 with a discovery cutoff in November 2015.\n\nThe plaintiffs sent out initial interrogatories and requests for production in\n\nJanuary 2015. The department serially produced thousands of pages of\n\ndocuments, many of them duplicative. The parties engaged in numerous\n\ncommunications about discovery issues.\n\n       After a hearing on November 13, 2015, the court granted the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment to establish the department's liability and to\n\ndismiss the department's affirmative defenses. A trial occurred in which the jury\n\nwas instructed that negligence and causation had already been established. The\n\njury returned a verdict awarding $4 million in damages to each child. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n       A negligence action requires a showing of duty, breach, causation, and\n\ndamages. Ranger Ins. Co. v. Pierce County, 164 Wn.2d 545, 552, 192 P.3d 886\n\n(2008). Summary judgment is proper only when there are no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact. CR 56(c). After the moving party has established an absence of\n\nfactual issues, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to set forth specific facts\n\nsufficiently rebutting the moving party's contentions and disclosing the existence\n\nof a material fact. Petcu v. State, 121 Wn. App. 36, 54, 86 P.3d 1234, review\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/6\n\n\ndenied, 152 Wn.2d 1033(2004); Seven Gables Corp. v. MGM/UA Entm't Co.,\n\n106 Wn.2d 1, 12-13, 721 P.2d 1(1986).\n\n                                      DUTY\n\n      The existence of a legal duty is a question of law considered de novo on\n\nappeal. N.K. v. Corp. of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\n\nDay Saints, 175 Wn. App. 517, 524-26, 307 P.3d 730, review denied, 179 Wn.2d\n\n1005 (2013).\n\n      The department contends there are no common law duties that apply to\n\nthe department's functions related to the case management of foster children. In\n\nthe department's view, the only actionable claim against the department by a\n\nchild who is abused in a foster or adoptive placement is a claim for negligent\n\ninvestigation premised upon and limited to the confines of RCW 26.44.050. This\n\nstatute, which requires the department to investigate child abuse, has been\n\ninterpreted to imply a cause of action for negligent investigation of abuse. M.W.\n\nv. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs., 149 Wn.2d 589, 595, 70 P.3d 954(2003). The\n\ndepartment argues that C.L. and S.L. cannot prevail under RCW 26.44.050\n\nbecause they do not allege that the department negligently investigated a child\n\nabuse referral pertaining to them.\n\n      The department's attempt to confine the plaintiffs to a cause of action for\n\nnegligent investigation of child abuse is unsupported. The M.W. court, while\n\nfinding no duty was owed in the particular circumstances of that case, recognized\n\nan actionable duty that flows from the department to children and parents who\n\nare harmed when the department's negligence results in placing a child into an\n\n\n                                        6\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/7\n\n\nabusive home. M.W., 149 Wn.2d at 597. In the Babcock case, our Supreme\n\nCourt \"implicitly approved\" a claim of negligence against the department for\n\nfailing to adequately investigate the backgrounds of prospective foster parents.\n\nTyner v. Dep't of Soc. & Health Servs., 141 Wn.2d 68, 79, 1 P.3d 1148 (2000),\n\ndiscussing Babcock v. State, 116 Wn.2d 596, 809 P.2d 143(1991). A number of\n\nstatutes and regulations direct the department to protect children by doing a\n\ncareful evaluation of a foster or adoptive home before recommending placement.\n\nSee e.p., RCW 26.33.010; RCW 74.15.010; WAC 388-148-1320, -1370.\n\nStatutory imperatives as well as strong public policy grounds support recognition\n\nof a cause of action in tort for prospective adoptive parents against adoption\n\nplacement agencies that negligently fail to disclose pertinent information about\n\nthe child. McKinney v. State, 134 Wn.2d 388, 397, 950 P.2d 461 (1998). The\n\ntort duty arises from the special relationship between adoption placement\n\nagencies and adopting parents McKinney, 134 Wn.2d at 397. Logically, a tort\n\nduty also arises from the special relationship between the department as a\n\nplacement agency and dependent children, allowing such children to seek a tort\n\nremedy when they are damaged by the department's negligent failure to uncover\n\npertinent information about their prospective adoptive home.\n\n       Under the common law, a duty to protect another from sexual assault by a\n\nthird party may arise where the defendant has a special relationship with the other\n\nwhich gives the other a right to protection. N.K., 175 Wn. App. at 525-26. The\n\nexistence of a duty predicated on a protective relationship requires knowledge of\n\nthe \"general field of danger\" within which the harm occurred. McLeod v. Grant\n\n\n                                         7\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/8\n\n\nCounty Sch. Dist. No. 128, 42 Wn.2d 316, 321, 255 P.2d 360(1953). The\n\nevidence in this case establishes beyond dispute the department's protective\n\nrelationship with the two plaintiffs and the department's knowledge that a home in\n\nwhich a sexual predator resides is dangerous to children.\n\n       After the department filed the appellant's brief in this matter, Division Two\n\nof this court recognized that the department owes to dependent children a duty of\n\nreasonable care to protect them against foreseeable tortious or criminal conduct\n\nin a foster family home. HBH v. State, 197 Wn. App. 77, 92, 387 P.3d 1093\n\n(2016), petition for review filed, No. 94529-2(Wash. May 22, 2017).\n\n       Absent proper monitoring by the State, a foster child is wholly\n       exposed to the will of the foster parents, whether that will is a\n       blessing or a horror. In this setting, the State is the last watchman\n       of the foster child's well-being. A more compelling illustration of the\n       bases of a special relationship. .. is hard to imagine.\n\nHBH, 197 Wn. App. at 92. HBH is consistent with the earlier cases cited above\n\nand other cases finding a duty of protection arising from a special relationship\n\nunder RESTATEMENT(SECOND)OF TORTS § 315(b). The special relationship duty\n\nexists regardless of whether the department breached the duty imposed by\n\nRCW 26.44.050. HBH 197 Wn. App. at 86 n.2.\n\n       HBH is cited in the brief of respondent. The department's reply brief does\n\nnot attack the reasoning of HBH. Instead, the department claims that the\n\nplaintiffs sought to establish liability solely by pursuing their cause of action for\n\nnegligent investigation under RCW 26.44.050. This is incorrect. The complaint\n\npleaded common law and statutory duties. The plaintiffs' motion for summary\n\njudgment argued common law and statutory duties. We may affirm a summary\n\n\n                                           8\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/9\n\n\njudgment order on any basis supported by the record. Redding v. Virginia Mason\n\nMed. Ctr., 75 Wn. App. 424, 426, 878 P.2d 483(1994). The record in this case\n\nsolidly supports the court's decision to find the element of duty established as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n                                     BREACH\n\n       The department contends that issues of fact preclude summary judgment\n\non breach.\n\n       Helen Anderson, the department employee who completed the adoption\n\npreplacement report, did not discover the 2001 referral on Dillon when reviewing\n\nthe Langes as potential adopters. She candidly admitted in her deposition that\n\nshe \"should have seen it\" because it was a Child Protective Services file that she\n\nshould have received when she did the background check on the Langes. As far\n\nas Anderson knew, the referral was available in the department's computer\n\nsystem and she was \"certainly competent on the computer systems,\" but \"why I\n\ndidn't get this, I don't know.\" She testified she \"would not have placed\" the girls\n\nwith the Langes if she had seen the referral. Anderson was \"surprised\" to see\n\nthat the Lange home had previously been approved for foster care in light of\n\nDillon's alleged sexual misconduct as reported to the department. She regretted\n\nthat she did not know about the referral when she met with the girls in the course\n\nof her review because \"if the girls were abused, I think that was something that\n\nwas foreseeable.\"\n\n       Expert witness Barbara Stone, who had worked for the department for\n\nmore than 30 years, submitted a declaration that the department breached the\n\n\n                                         9\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/10\n\n\nstandard of care by recommending and facilitating the adoption of C.L. and S.L.,\n\nnotwithstanding the 2001 referral. \"The standard of care for social workers\n\nduring the foster placement process always includes a referral search for prior\n\nsexual abuse.\" Stone observed that \"a simple computer search for any member\n\nof the Lange family would have revealed the sexual abuse history of Dillon Lange\n\nwithin less than ten minutes.\" In her opinion, the Langes should not have been\n\nlicensed for foster care \"without further exploration.\"\n\n       The department presented the declaration of expert witness Joan Rycraft\n\nthat the actions of the department's social workers who licensed the Lange home\n\nfor foster care, placed the girls there, and recommended adoption by the Langes,\n\n\"were reasonable and met the social work standard of care.\"\n\n       In general, when experts offer competing, apparently competent evidence,\n\nsummary judgment is inappropriate. See Larson v. Nelson, 118 Wn. App. 797,\n\n810, 77 P.3d 671 (2003). But conclusory statements of fact will not suffice to\n\ndefeat a motion for summary judgment. Grimwood v. Univ. of Puget Sound, Inc.,\n\n110 Wn.2d 355, 359-60, 753 P.2d 517(1988). Rycraft's conclusory statement\n\nthat the standard of care was met does not rebut Stone's testimony that the\n\ndepartment breached the standard of care by failing to discover critical\n\ninformation in its own files. Anderson herself acknowledged the breach.\n\n       The parties debate whether Rycraft's declaration should be disregarded\n\non the issue of breach to the extent that it contradicts her deposition testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/11\n\n\nWe need not address this controversy.1 Stone and Anderson testified that to\n\nmeet the standard of care, the department's workers should have known of the\n\nreferral accusing Dillon of child molestation and in view of that information should\n\nnot have recommended the adoption. To rebut this evidence, the department\n\nneeded evidence that even if the department employees had known about the\n\nreferral, it would have been reasonable for them to recommend and facilitate the\n\nplacement of the girls into the Lange home. Rycraft's declaration does not make\n\nthis statement and thus does not raise an issue of material fact as to breach.\n\n       Summary judgment will be affirmed only if, from all the evidence,\n\nreasonable persons could reach but one conclusion. Petcu, 121 Wn. App. at 55.\n\nWe conclude that no reasonable juror, properly instructed on the department's\n\nduty, could hear the evidence in this record and find that the department met the\n\nstandard of care.\n\n                                   CAUSATION\n\n       The department contends the issue of proximate cause should have gone\n\nto the jury. Cause in fact is established by showing that but for the defendant's\n\nactions, the claimant would not have been injured. Petcu, 121 Wn. App. at 56. It\n\nis ordinarily a question for the jury unless reasonable minds could reach but one\n\nconclusion. Petcu, 121 Wn. App. at 56.\n\n       Prima facie proof of causation is provided by Anderson's testimony that if\n\nshe and her supervisor had seen the referral on Dillon, they \"would not have\n\n\n\n       1 Consequently, we do not decide the department's motion to strike\nadditional authorities submitted by respondents after oral argument in this court.\n                                        11\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/12\n\n\nplaced them in there,\" and by Stone's opinion that but for the department's\n\nnegligence, the two girls would not have experienced the years of sexual abuse\n\nin the Lange home.\n\n       Citing Rycraft's declaration, the department argues that an issue of fact as\n\nto causation is created by a licensing statute, which stated that an unfounded\n\nreport of child abuse or neglect may not be used to deny a foster home license.2\n\nRycraft opines that because the law enforcement investigation ended\n\ninconclusively, the 2001 referral about Dillon did not rise to the level of \"a\n\nfounded child abuse report.\" Accordingly, the department contends the referral\n\ncould not have been used as a basis for denying the Langes' application for a\n\nfoster care license.\n\n       The licensing statute is irrelevant. The allegation in the referral was that\n\nDillon engaged in criminal conduct; it was not a report of child abuse by Benjamin\n\nor Carolyn. And the adoption was not an administrative proceeding in which the\n\nLanges were contesting the department's refusal to issue them a foster home\n\nlicense. The department social workers, if aware of the allegations against\n\nDillon, would have had every right and reason to recommend denial of the\n\nLanges' application.\n\n\n         any adjudicative proceeding regarding the denial, modification,\n       2 In\n     suspension, or revocation of a foster family home license, the\n     department's decision shall be upheld if there is reasonable cause\n     to believe that:\n            (a)The applicant or licensee lacks the character, suitability,\n     or competence to care for children placed in out-of-home care,\n      however, no unfounded report of child abuse or neglect may be\n      used to deny employment or a license.\nFormer RCW 74.15.130(2)(a)(2004).\n                                          12\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/13\n\n\n       But for the department's evaluation of the Langes as capable of providing\n\na safe home, the girls would not have been injured. The evidence is unequivocal\n\nthat knowledge of the 2001 referral would have caused the department to\n\nrecommend against placement and adoption. A reasonable jury could not\n\nspeculate that the adoption petition would have been presented to and approved\n\nby the court in the face of what the department knew or should have known\n\nabout Dillon.\n\n       Because the record shows no genuine issues of material fact as to duty,\n\nbreach, or causation, the court correctly granted partial summary judgment\n\nestablishing liability.\n\n                            AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n       The department's answer stated affirmative defenses including (1)failure\n\nto state a claim;(2)for the purpose of RCW 4.22.070(1), any damages were\n\ncaused by the fault of nonparties including the girls' biological mother and\n\nCarolyn, Benjamin, Co!ten, and Dillon Lange;(3) damages caused by the\n\nintentional conduct of other persons or entities must be segregated from\n\ndamages allegedly caused by the department; (4)the plaintiffs may have failed\n\nto mitigate their damages;(5)the department's actions manifested a reasonable\n\nexercise of judgment and discretion and are not actionable;(6) claim preclusion;\n\n(7) court decisions were an intervening, superseding cause;(8) immunity for\n\ncertain matters asserted; and (9)the State's potential entitlement to an offset\n\nfrom any award to the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/14\n\n\n       The trial court dismissed the department's affirmative defenses for failure\n\nto set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue of fact and alternatively as a\n\nsanction for alleged discovery violations.\n\n       Striking all of the State's affirmative defenses was a severe sanction for a\n\ndiscovery violation. In imposing a severe sanction, a trial court is obliged to\n\nmake findings that lesser sanctions would not have been adequate, that the\n\ndiscovery violation was willful, and that the violation substantially prejudiced the\n\nother party. Burnet v. Spokane Ambulance, 131 Wn.2d 484, 494, 933 P.2d 1036\n\n(1997). The trial court must \"explain its reasons on the record\" and cannot rely\n\non the record to speak for itself. Blair v. TA-Seattle E. No. 176, 171 Wn.2d 342,\n\n349, 254 P.3d 797(2011). The order needs to be supportable at the time it takes\n\neffect, not in hindsight. Blair, 171 Wn.2d at 350. Thus, the findings on the\n\nBurnet factors must be made \"in the order itself or in some contemporaneous\n\nrecorded finding.\" Teter v. Deck, 174 Wn.2d 207, 217, 274 P.3d 336 (2012).\n\n       We are not convinced the trial court complied with these requirements.\n\nDuring the hearing on November 13, the court did not specifically address the\n\nBurnet factors. Findings supporting the decision were not entered until January\n\n8,2016, when the trial was about to begin.\n\n       We nonetheless affirm the order dismissing the affirmative defenses. The\n\nrecord supports the alternative ground that the department's response to the\n\nmotion to strike the defenses on summary judgment did not show the existence\n\nof a genuine issue of material fact as required by CR 56(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/15\n\n\n       A party moving for summary judgment can meet its burden by pointing out\n\nto the trial court that the nonmoving party lacks sufficient evidence to support its\n\ncase. Guile v. Ballard Cmtv. Hosp., 70 Wn. App. 18, 21-22, 851 P.2d 689 (citing\n\nYoung v. Key Pharms., Inc., 112 Wn.2d 216, 225 n.1, 770 P.2d 182(1989)),\n\nreview denied, 122 Wn.2d 1010 (1993). The moving party must identify those\n\nportions of the record that demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. Guile 70 Wn. App. at 22. The burden then shifts to the party with\n\nthe burden of proof at trial. Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225. As the defendant, the\n\ndepartment bears the burden of proving affirmative defenses. E.g., Brougham v.\n\nSwarva, 34 Wn. App. 68, 75, 661 P.2d 138(1983). As the nonmoving party, the\n\ndepartment could not rely on the allegations made in its pleadings but was\n\nobligated to set forth specific facts showing that there was a genuine issue for\n\ntrial on the affirmative defense. See Young, 112 Wn.2d at 225-26.\n\n       Plaintiffs' motion argued that the department's lack of evidence was\n\nshown by its evasive responses to interrogatories. One interrogatory requested\n\n\"the factual basis for each and every affirmative defense\" alleged in the\n\ndepartment's answer. The department's initial and supplemental responses to\n\nthis interrogatory were prefaced by objections that it was \"overly broad and\n\nunduly burdensome,\" it called \"for the mental impressions and legal theories of\n\ndefense counsel,\" it was \"work product and not discoverable,\" and it was a \"trap\n\nfor Defendant because it can easily produce claims that the Defendant did not\n\ncompletely respond to the request.\" The objection was followed by:\"ANSWER:\n\nWithout waiving the above objections, see generally, Answer.\" Related\n\n\n                                         15\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/16\n\n\ninterrogatories and requests for production were given similar treatment.\n\nThroughout the discovery period, the department's position on its affirmative\n\ndefenses remained opaque, supported primarily by string cites to identification\n\nnumbers of\"documents previously produced.\"\n\n       Plaintiffs' motion, filed on October 16, 2015, claimed they were entitled to\n\ndismissal of the affirmative defenses \"unless Defendant produces evidence\n\nsufficient to establish a prima facie case for each affirmative defense alleged by\n\nthe Defendant in its answer.\"\n\n       On October 29, 2015, the department provided several pages of\n\nsupplemental discovery responses. These responses did no more than repeat\n\nthe department's answer to the complaint:\n\n      • the biological mother of the girls as well as their adopting parents were\n\n          at fault for failing to protect the girls and for concealing information;\n\n      • Dillon and Co!ten were negligent and had committed intentional torts;\n\n      • damages should be segregated to each intentional tortfeasor;\n\n      • the girls \"may have failed to mitigate their damages by declining\n\n          therapy and services\";\n\n      • prior court orders and the abusive acts of the Lange brothers operated\n\n          as superseding, intervening causes of harm, relieving the department\n\n          of liability;\n\n      • the department\"may be entitled\" to an offset for funds the girls\n\n          received from state programs such as foster care, adding \"This\n\n          response may be supplemented\";\n\n\n                                         16\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/17\n\n\n      • an interrogatory about the defense of contributory or comparative fault\n\n          \"calls for attorney work product,\" but without waiving that objection,\n\n          \"Defendant may either supplement this answer or waive this affirmative\n\n          defense at trial\";\n\n      • an interrogatory asking whether the department believed nonparties\n\n           were at fault or liable was objectionable as calling for attorney work\n\n           product, but without waiving the objection, the Langes and the\n\n           biological mother of the girls \"are wholly responsible for the injuries that\n\n           Plaintiffs claim. This answer may be supplemented as discovery\n\n          continues.\"\n\n       On November 2, 2015, the department filed a response to the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for summary judgment, claiming that the facts stated in the supplemental\n\ndiscovery responses on October 29, 2015, provided prima facie grounds for\n\ndenial of the motion to dismiss the affirmative defenses.\n\n       The department's response brief of November 2, 2015, did not address\n\nthe prima facie showing necessary to establish any particular affirmative defense.\n\nNor did it associate any particular document with any particular affirmative\n\ndefense. The brief rested on the mere allegations of the department's answer to\n\nthe complaint accompanied by numerical references to thousands of otherwise\n\nundifferentiated documents. The department, as the nonmoving party, did not\n\nmeet its burden under CR 56(e)to show the court a genuine issue of material\n\nfact that would justify sending the affirmative defenses to the jury for decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/18\n\n\n                              EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n        The department assigns error to three evidentiary rulings made at trial.\n\nWe will not alter a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence unless \"a\n\nsubstantial right of the party is affected.\" ER 103(a).\n\n       The trial court excluded a statement that the older girl gave to police the\n\nsame day she initially reported the sexual abuse. The department claims there\n\nare inconsistencies between the statement and her trial testimony. The\n\ndepartment was permitted to explore the alleged inconsistencies at trial through\n\ncross-examination. The department fails to show how the exclusion of the\n\nstatement, if error, affected a substantial right.\n\n       The department contends the court should have excluded, as hearsay, a\n\ndetective's testimony about his report of a recent interview with Dillon, who at the\n\ntime of the interview had not been convicted. Some of Dillon's remarks during\n\nthe interview could be interpreted as admissions of guilt. The department initially\n\nraised a hearsay objection. But after an extensive colloquy, counsel for the\n\ndepartment said, \"I think the Court can allow the admissions to come in\" without\n\nthose portions that were irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. In view of this\n\ncolloquy, we conclude the hearsay objection was not preserved.\n\n       The department claims the court conveyed a personal opinion to the jury\n\nduring closing argument by allowing plaintiffs' counsel to refer to testimony\n\noffered by the younger girl's guardian ad litem, while prohibiting the department\n\nfrom discussing the same testimony. The rulings do not convey a personal\n\nopinion and in any event were not prejudicial.\n\n\n                                          18\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/19\n\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n                        3eck4e-21 )1, .\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                   19\n\f",

A jury\n\nawarded damages of $4 million for each child. We affirm.\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/2\n\n\n                                      FACTS\n\n       Sisters C.L. and S.L. were born in 1996 and 2000, respectively. As young\n\nchildren, they lived with their mother in Everett. Their father was incarcerated out\n\nof state. Child Protective Services received reports that the girls' mother was\n\nusing drugs and was abusive and neglectful. The girls were removed from her\n\ncare in 2002 and were found dependent.\n\n       C.L. and S.L. lived in various foster homes, including one placement with\n\nsome friends of Benjamin and Carolyn Lange. The Langes decided to apply for a\n\nfoster license specifically so that they could be a placement for the two girls. The\n\nLanges had three biological sons, born in 1987, 1989, and 1992. The application\n\nasked,\"Have you, or anyone in your family, been sexually or physically abused?\n\nAnd, have you or anyone in your family been a perpetrator or had a restraining\n\norder or protective order filed?\" The Langes disclosed that their middle son,\n\nDillon, had been \"sexually abused by an older girl (with a history of abuse)\"\n\nduring school hours when he was in kindergarten and first grade. They said\n\nDillon had received counseling \"and is ok now.\"\n\n       The Langes did not disclose that Dillon was also an alleged perpetrator of\n\nsexual abuse. The department had in its files a referral to Child Protective\n\nServices concerning an incident in 2001, when Dillon was 12. According to the\n\nintake report, Dillon's 12-year-old cousin walked into a room and saw Dillon put\n\nhis penis into the rectum of a 5-year-old cousin. The incident was reported to law\n\nenforcement for investigation. The officers who investigated the accusation\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/3\n\n\nagainst Dillon reported they were unable to establish probable cause because\n\nneither Dillon nor the younger boy admitted to sexual conduct.\n\n       The social worker responsible for reviewing the Langes'foster application\n\ndid not discover the 2001 referral concerning Dillon. The State issued a license\n\nto the Langes in December 2002 and placed the girls in the Lange home in June\n\n2003. Social workers who checked up on the girls documented positive\n\nobservations about their assimilation into the Lange family. The girls reportedly\n\nappeared bonded with Benjamin, Carolyn, and the three boys.\n\n       In late 2003, the State terminated the rights of the girls' biological parents.\n\nThe Langes expressed interest in adoption.\n\n       The department was required to complete a preplacement report making a\n\nrecommendation as to the fitness of the prospective adopters based on their\n\n\"home environment, family life, health, facilities, and resources.\" Former\n\nRCW 26.33.190(2)(1991). Social worker Helen Anderson completed a\n\npreplacement report on the Langes. The report mentions that Dillon was\n\nmolested. It does not mention that Dillon allegedly molested his cousin because\n\nAnderson did not see the 2001 intake report when gathering information on the\n\nLanges, although she admitted in a deposition that she should have. Her\n\npreplacement report states that background checks on Carolyn, Benjamin, and\n\ntheir oldest son did not reveal any disqualifying information. Anderson\n\nrecommended that the adoptions go forward.\n\n       The department was also required to complete a postplacement report\n\nbefore the adoption was finalized. RCW 26.33.200(1). The postplacement\n\n\n                                          3\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/4\n\n\nreports referred to the preplacernent reports and concluded that the Lange home\n\nwas adequate. A court approved the adoptions on August 24, 2004.\n\n       Around this time, the two younger boys—Dillon and Co!ten Lange—began\n\nto subject the girls to sexual abuse. C.L. testified that Dillon began molesting her\n\nwhen she was 8 and he was around 14. She said Dillon would come into her\n\nroom at night, undress her, and touch her breasts and vagina with his hands,\n\npenis, and mouth. She said that this occurred on a regular basis until she was\n\n12, that Colten regularly abused her during the same timeframe, and that both\n\nboys at times put their penises in her mouth. S.L. testified to similar experiences\n\nwith Dillon from when she was 6 or 7 until she was 11, and at least once with\n\nCo!ten. She said if she told Dillon to stop, he would cover her mouth or choke\n\nher, and would threaten to kill her if she told anyone.\n\n       C.L. testified that she told Carolyn about the sexual abuse in 2011.\n\nCarolyn \"didn't believe\" C.L. and told her that if anything had happened, she \"just\n\nneeded to forgive\" her brothers.\n\n       In August 2013, C.L. told her friend and her friend's mother about the\n\nsexual abuse. They contacted Child Protective Services. C.L. did not go back to\n\nthe Lange home. The State removed S.L. from the Lange home in November\n\n2013. During the ensuing police investigation, Co!ten confessed to having sexual\n\ncontact with the girls. Dillon confessed to some of the allegations.\n\n      This lawsuit was filed on December 31, 2014, alleging the department's\n\nnegligence in screening the background of the Lange family before facilitating the\n\nplacement and adoption of the girls by the Langes. The complaint particularly\n\n\n                                         4\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/5\n\n\nalleged that the department facilitated the adoption despite having information\n\nthat Dillon had been accused of having anal intercourse with his younger cousin.\n\nThe department's answer denied liability and stated numerous affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n       Trial was set for January 2016 with a discovery cutoff in November 2015.\n\nThe plaintiffs sent out initial interrogatories and requests for production in\n\nJanuary 2015. The department serially produced thousands of pages of\n\ndocuments, many of them duplicative. The parties engaged in numerous\n\ncommunications about discovery issues.\n\n       After a hearing on November 13, 2015, the court granted the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment to establish the department's liability and to\n\ndismiss the department's affirmative defenses. A trial occurred in which the jury\n\nwas instructed that negligence and causation had already been established. The\n\njury returned a verdict awarding $4 million in damages to each child. This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n       A negligence action requires a showing of duty, breach, causation, and\n\ndamages. Ranger Ins. Co. v.

She candidly admitted in her deposition that\n\nshe \"should have seen it\" because it was a Child Protective Services file that she\n\nshould have received when she did the background check on the Langes. As far\n\nas Anderson knew, the referral was available in the department's computer\n\nsystem and she was \"certainly competent on the computer systems,\" but \"why I\n\ndidn't get this, I don't know.\" She testified she \"would not have placed\" the girls\n\nwith the Langes if she had seen the referral. Anderson was \"surprised\" to see\n\nthat the Lange home had previously been approved for foster care in light of\n\nDillon's alleged sexual misconduct as reported to the department. She regretted\n\nthat she did not know about the referral when she met with the girls in the course\n\nof her review because \"if the girls were abused, I think that was something that\n\nwas foreseeable.\"\n\n       Expert witness Barbara Stone, who had worked for the department for\n\nmore than 30 years, submitted a declaration that the department breached the\n\n\n                                         9\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/10\n\n\nstandard of care by recommending and facilitating the adoption of C.L. and S.L.,\n\nnotwithstanding the 2001 referral. \"The standard of care for social workers\n\nduring the foster placement process always includes a referral search for prior\n\nsexual abuse.\" Stone observed that \"a simple computer search for any member\n\nof the Lange family would have revealed the sexual abuse history of Dillon Lange\n\nwithin less than ten minutes.\" In her opinion, the Langes should not have been\n\nlicensed for foster care \"without further exploration.\"\n\n       The department presented the declaration of expert witness Joan Rycraft\n\nthat the actions of the department's social workers who licensed the Lange home\n\nfor foster care, placed the girls there, and recommended adoption by the Langes,\n\n\"were reasonable and met the social work standard of care.\"\n\n       In general, when experts offer competing, apparently competent evidence,\n\nsummary judgment is inappropriate. See Larson v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Rycraft's conclusory statement\n\nthat the standard of care was met does not rebut Stone's testimony that the\n\ndepartment breached the standard of care by failing to discover critical\n\ninformation in its own files. Anderson herself acknowledged the breach.\n\n       The parties debate whether Rycraft's declaration should be disregarded\n\non the issue of breach to the extent that it contradicts her deposition testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/11\n\n\nWe need not address this controversy.1 Stone and Anderson testified that to\n\nmeet the standard of care, the department's workers should have known of the\n\nreferral accusing Dillon of child molestation and in view of that information should\n\nnot have recommended the adoption. To rebut this evidence, the department\n\nneeded evidence that even if the department employees had known about the\n\nreferral, it would have been reasonable for them to recommend and facilitate the\n\nplacement of the girls into the Lange home. Rycraft's declaration does not make\n\nthis statement and thus does not raise an issue of material fact as to breach.\n\n       Summary judgment will be affirmed only if, from all the evidence,\n\nreasonable persons could reach but one conclusion. Petcu, 121 Wn. App. at 55.\n\nWe conclude that no reasonable juror, properly instructed on the department's\n\nduty, could hear the evidence in this record and find that the department met the\n\nstandard of care.\n\n                                   CAUSATION\n\n       The department contends the issue of proximate cause should have gone\n\nto the jury. Cause in fact is established by showing that but for the defendant's\n\nactions, the claimant would not have been injured. Petcu, 121 Wn. App. at 56. It\n\nis ordinarily a question for the jury unless reasonable minds could reach but one\n\nconclusion. Petcu, 121 Wn. App. at 56.\n\n       Prima facie proof of causation is provided by Anderson's testimony that if\n\nshe and her supervisor had seen the referral on Dillon, they \"would not have\n\n\n\n       1 Consequently, we do not decide the department's motion to strike\nadditional authorities submitted by respondents after oral argument in this court.\n                                        11\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/12\n\n\nplaced them in there,\" and by Stone's opinion that but for the department's\n\nnegligence, the two girls would not have experienced the years of sexual abuse\n\nin the Lange home.\n\n       Citing Rycraft's declaration, the department argues that an issue of fact as\n\nto causation is created by a licensing statute, which stated that an unfounded\n\nreport of child abuse or neglect may not be used to deny a foster home license.2\n\nRycraft opines that because the law enforcement investigation ended\n\ninconclusively, the 2001 referral about Dillon did not rise to the level of \"a\n\nfounded child abuse report.\" Accordingly, the department contends the referral\n\ncould not have been used as a basis for denying the Langes' application for a\n\nfoster care license.\n\n       The licensing statute is irrelevant. The allegation in the referral was that\n\nDillon engaged in criminal conduct; it was not a report of child abuse by Benjamin\n\nor Carolyn. And the adoption was not an administrative proceeding in which the\n\nLanges were contesting the department's refusal to issue them a foster home\n\nlicense. The department social workers, if aware of the allegations against\n\nDillon, would have had every right and reason to recommend denial of the\n\nLanges' application.\n\n\n         any adjudicative proceeding regarding the denial, modification,\n       2 In\n     suspension, or revocation of a foster family home license, the\n     department's decision shall be upheld if there is reasonable cause\n     to believe that:\n            (a)The applicant or licensee lacks the character, suitability,\n     or competence to care for children placed in out-of-home care,\n      however, no unfounded report of child abuse or neglect may be\n      used to deny employment or a license.\nFormer RCW 74.15.130(2)(a)(2004).\n                                          12\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/13\n\n\n       But for the department's evaluation of the Langes as capable of providing\n\na safe home, the girls would not have been injured. The evidence is unequivocal\n\nthat knowledge of the 2001 referral would have caused the department to\n\nrecommend against placement and adoption. A reasonable jury could not\n\nspeculate that the adoption petition would have been presented to and approved\n\nby the court in the face of what the department knew or should have known\n\nabout Dillon.\n\n       Because the record shows no genuine issues of material fact as to duty,\n\nbreach, or causation, the court correctly granted partial summary judgment\n\nestablishing liability.\n\n                            AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n\n       The department's answer stated affirmative defenses including (1)failure\n\nto state a claim;(2)for the purpose of RCW 4.22.070(1), any damages were\n\ncaused by the fault of nonparties including the girls' biological mother and\n\nCarolyn, Benjamin, Co!ten, and Dillon Lange;(3) damages caused by the\n\nintentional conduct of other persons or entities must be segregated from\n\ndamages allegedly caused by the department; (4)the plaintiffs may have failed\n\nto mitigate their damages;(5)the department's actions manifested a reasonable\n\nexercise of judgment and discretion and are not actionable;(6) claim preclusion;\n\n(7) court decisions were an intervening, superseding cause;(8) immunity for\n\ncertain matters asserted; and (9)the State's potential entitlement to an offset\n\nfrom any award to the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/14\n\n\n       The trial court dismissed the department's affirmative defenses for failure\n\nto set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue of fact and alternatively as a\n\nsanction for alleged discovery violations.\n\n       Striking all of the State's affirmative defenses was a severe sanction for a\n\ndiscovery violation. In imposing a severe sanction, a trial court is obliged to\n\nmake findings that lesser sanctions would not have been adequate, that the\n\ndiscovery violation was willful, and that the violation substantially prejudiced the\n\nother party.

These responses did no more than repeat\n\nthe department's answer to the complaint:\n\n      • the biological mother of the girls as well as their adopting parents were\n\n          at fault for failing to protect the girls and for concealing information;\n\n      • Dillon and Co!ten were negligent and had committed intentional torts;\n\n      • damages should be segregated to each intentional tortfeasor;\n\n      • the girls \"may have failed to mitigate their damages by declining\n\n          therapy and services\";\n\n      • prior court orders and the abusive acts of the Lange brothers operated\n\n          as superseding, intervening causes of harm, relieving the department\n\n          of liability;\n\n      • the department\"may be entitled\" to an offset for funds the girls\n\n          received from state programs such as foster care, adding \"This\n\n          response may be supplemented\";\n\n\n                                         16\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/17\n\n\n      • an interrogatory about the defense of contributory or comparative fault\n\n          \"calls for attorney work product,\" but without waiving that objection,\n\n          \"Defendant may either supplement this answer or waive this affirmative\n\n          defense at trial\";\n\n      • an interrogatory asking whether the department believed nonparties\n\n           were at fault or liable was objectionable as calling for attorney work\n\n           product, but without waiving the objection, the Langes and the\n\n           biological mother of the girls \"are wholly responsible for the injuries that\n\n           Plaintiffs claim. This answer may be supplemented as discovery\n\n          continues.\"\n\n       On November 2, 2015, the department filed a response to the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for summary judgment, claiming that the facts stated in the supplemental\n\ndiscovery responses on October 29, 2015, provided prima facie grounds for\n\ndenial of the motion to dismiss the affirmative defenses.\n\n       The department's response brief of November 2, 2015, did not address\n\nthe prima facie showing necessary to establish any particular affirmative defense.\n\nNor did it associate any particular document with any particular affirmative\n\ndefense. The brief rested on the mere allegations of the department's answer to\n\nthe complaint accompanied by numerical references to thousands of otherwise\n\nundifferentiated documents. The department, as the nonmoving party, did not\n\nmeet its burden under CR 56(e)to show the court a genuine issue of material\n\nfact that would justify sending the affirmative defenses to the jury for decision.\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/18\n\n\n                              EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n        The department assigns error to three evidentiary rulings made at trial.\n\nWe will not alter a trial court's decision to admit or exclude evidence unless \"a\n\nsubstantial right of the party is affected.\" ER 103(a).\n\n       The trial court excluded a statement that the older girl gave to police the\n\nsame day she initially reported the sexual abuse. The department claims there\n\nare inconsistencies between the statement and her trial testimony. The\n\ndepartment was permitted to explore the alleged inconsistencies at trial through\n\ncross-examination. The department fails to show how the exclusion of the\n\nstatement, if error, affected a substantial right.\n\n       The department contends the court should have excluded, as hearsay, a\n\ndetective's testimony about his report of a recent interview with Dillon, who at the\n\ntime of the interview had not been convicted. Some of Dillon's remarks during\n\nthe interview could be interpreted as admissions of guilt. The department initially\n\nraised a hearsay objection. But after an extensive colloquy, counsel for the\n\ndepartment said, \"I think the Court can allow the admissions to come in\" without\n\nthose portions that were irrelevant and unduly prejudicial. In view of this\n\ncolloquy, we conclude the hearsay objection was not preserved.\n\n       The department claims the court conveyed a personal opinion to the jury\n\nduring closing argument by allowing plaintiffs' counsel to refer to testimony\n\noffered by the younger girl's guardian ad litem, while prohibiting the department\n\nfrom discussing the same testimony. The rulings do not convey a personal\n\nopinion and in any event were not prejudicial.\n\n\n                                          18\n\fNo. 74892-1-1/19\n\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n                        3eck4e-21 )1, .\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                   19\n\f</pre>",
