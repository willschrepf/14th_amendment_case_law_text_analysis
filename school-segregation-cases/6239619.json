Plaintiffs also claim that defendants failed to take\nprompt action to mitigate damages when the IRS issued revenue rulings and regulations\nin 2004 and 2005 that called such 412(i) plans into question. Defendants\ncross-complained for indemnity and comparative fault against American General Life\nInsurance Company (American General), whose products funded plaintiffs’ 412(i) Plan.\n\f       At issue in this appeal are defendants’ and American General’s separate motions\nfor summary judgment, which the trial court granted after finding that plaintiffs’ claims\nwere time-barred. Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred by (1) determining that the\nlimitations period began to run as of September 2007, when plaintiffs were “on notice”\nthat the IRS would impose penalties in connection with the 412(i) Plan, rather than in\n2010 when penalties were assessed, (2) failing to consider any tolling effect created by\nthe ongoing fiduciary relationship between defendants and plaintiffs, and (3) applying the\nSeptember 2007 “notice” date as a bar to all causes of action in the complaint.\n       For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\n                                  I.   BACKGROUND\n  A. PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT\n       Husband and wife, Nelson Choi and Jeannie Choi (the Chois), and their\nclosely-held corporation Choice Instruments, Inc. (together “plaintiffs”) filed this action\nin November 2010 against their former financial advisors (individuals Matthew Roberson\nand Richard Brown, and Sagemark Consulting, Lincoln Financial Advisors, and Lincoln\nNational Corporation—together “defendants”), asserting causes of action for negligence,\nfraud and deceit, and breach of contract.\n       According to the complaint, the Chois consulted in 2003 with Roberson and\nBrown of Sagemark Consulting, who also were authorized agents of Lincoln Financial,\nfor assistance with investments, asset protection, and tax planning. Defendants advised\nthe Chois that an Internal Revenue Code section 412(i) Plan retirement account was ideal\nfor them and would provide tax advantages, asset protection, and steady income. It\nrequired a complex program of several steps. First, plaintiffs were to purchase large\namounts of “whole life” insurance and pay annual premiums on a five-year schedule.\nSecond, after five years the Chois would purchase the whole life policies from the 412(i)\nPlan at a low “ ‘cash surrender value,’ ” leaving cash in the 412(i) Plan account while the\nChois would own the whole life policies personally. This allegedly would create a\n\n                                             2\n\f“ ‘springing’ ” or increasing cash value for plaintiffs. The third step was a “ ‘power\nplay’ ” exchange of the whole life policies for certain American General Universal Life\n“ ‘Platinum Provider’ ” policies, which would allow plaintiffs to take advantage of\ngenerous borrowing provisions and tax-free cash flow based on the increased policy\nvalues.\n       Per defendants’ recommendation, Choice Instruments bought the Chois individual\nAmerican General whole life policies in 2003, which required annual premium payments\non a five-year schedule through 2007, for a total purchase price of $1,275,000.\nDefendants urged the Chois to buy similar policies in 2004, requiring premium payments\nover five years through 2008, for a total purchase price of $439,000. The policies\ncomprised 70 to 75 percent of the 412(i) Plan portfolio. Defendants allegedly touted the\n“certainty of the immediate deductibility of such contributions” to the 412(i) Plan\naccount, which they “assured . . . was appropriate and authorized by applicable tax law.”\nThey allegedly assured plaintiffs that the program was “ ‘bullet proof,’ ” time-tested, and\ncarried no substantial risk of adverse IRS action or tax consequences.\n       The IRS audit began in 2006. Plaintiffs alleged damages beginning in 2008, when\ncontrary to the previously-represented “ ‘exit strategy’ ” of purchasing the whole life\npolicies at the low cash surrender value, defendants advised them that the IRS would\nrequire fair market value. Plaintiffs paid a total of $613,000 for the purchase of the four\npolicies (approximately $300,000 1 over the anticipated cost). Defendants advised\nplaintiffs to convert the 412(i) Plan to a traditional Internal Revenue Code section 412\nPlan (the “412 Plan”) because the IRS had adopted a negative view of the policies under\nthe 412(i) Plan and considered them defective and not IRS-approved. Defendants\nasserted that this was the fault of American General.\n\n       1\n        Plaintiffs alleged a difference of approximately $212,000 for the 2003 policies\nand approximately $77,000 to $82,000 for the 2004 policies.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Plaintiffs alleged additional damages in 2008 and 2009 from the purchase of\nwhole life policies through Penn Mutual, which they claimed defendants falsely advised\nwas necessary to comply with the requirements of the converted 412 Plan and resulted in\nan “immediate loss” in cash value of approximately $470,000. Plaintiffs further alleged\nthat in 2009, after the IRS audit ended, they were required to pay in excess of $440,000 in\nback taxes and interest for disallowed deductions under the 412(i) Plan, plus $60,000 in\nadditional penalties, and faced future estimated payments of $100,000 to the Franchise\nTax Board of California and anticipated IRS penalties of $600,000 for not reporting the\ntransactions on form 8886.\n       Plaintiffs in sum alleged that defendants “misrepresented, concealed and failed to\ndisclose” the risk that: (1) the “great weighting of life insurance policies” in excess of 50\npercent of plan assets would render the 412(i) Plan “suspect and defective in the view of\nthe IRS”; (2) the IRS would disallow the deductibility of contributions into the 412(i)\nPlan account for the life insurance purchases; (3) the “ ‘springing’ ” cash values would be\nsuspect and unlikely to be approved by the IRS, so plaintiffs would be forced to pay far\nmore (fair market value) than the low cash surrender value; (4) the “irrevocable right” to\n“power play” exchange the whole life policies for the superior “ ‘Platinum Provider’ ”\npolicies was not guaranteed, because American General had a reservation of rights to\nchange or withdraw policies; and (5) the policy purchases were most likely “reportable\ntransactions to be listed on Form 8886” and could be considered abusive tax shelters.\nThey alleged that they would have been better served by purchasing all or mostly\nannuities in a 412(i) Plan, or by “conventional investments,” and that defendants’\nrepresentations that the 412(i) Plan was time-tested and carried little risk of disallowance\nwere false.\n  B. DEFENDANTS’ ANSWER AND CROSS-COMPLAINT\n       Defendants answered the complaint, pleading as an affirmative defense the bar of\n“the applicable statute of limitations, including but not limited to California Code of Civil\n\n                                              4\n\fProcedure section 338.” Defendants also cross-complained against American General for\nindemnity and comparative fault. Defendants assert on appeal that the cross-complaint\nwas “wholly derivative” of plaintiffs’ complaint, so if they were found not liable to\nplaintiffs, American General would not be liable to them. 2\n  C. SUMMARY JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c) 3 in October\n2013, and plaintiffs filed opposition in May 2014, following stipulated time extensions.\n       Defendants argued that plaintiffs could not prevail as a matter of law as to each\ncause of action, that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations,\nand that the corporate defendants were not proper parties to the action. In support of the\nstatute of limitations defense, defendants requested judicial notice of the filing date of\nplaintiffs’ complaint (November 12, 2010) and of an IRS revenue ruling from March\n2004. We summarize the evidence and arguments pertaining only to the statute of\nlimitations issue.\n       Based on the November 2010 filing date of plaintiffs’ complaint, defendants\nargued that plaintiffs were time-barred from asserting a negligence or breach of implied\ncontract claim that accrued prior to November 2008, or a fraud claim that accrued prior to\nNovember 2007 (based on the applicable statutes of limitations for negligence (former\n§ 339.1), breach of contract (§ 339), and fraud (§ 338, subd. (d)). Defendants offered two\ncommunications to show that plaintiffs were informed as of November 2006 that the IRS\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The record on appeal does not contain a copy of the cross-complaint against\nAmerican General. We rely on defendants’ statement that the cross-complaint was\n“wholly derivative” of plaintiffs’ complaint only insofar as it appears to be consistent\nwith the trial court’s ruling on the motion for summary judgment, which addressed both\ndefendants’ and American General’s motions for summary judgment.\n       3\n         Unspecified statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fhad identified defects in the 412(i) Plan, and as of September 2007 that there would be\nIRS penalties and damages accruing.\n       First, in a letter dated November 28, 2006, from the IRS to Choice Instruments,\nthe IRS listed defects of the 412(i) Plan and recommended that plaintiffs unwind the plan\nand distribute the policies, or convert to a section 412 Plan.\n       Second, in an e-mail dated September 19, 2007, from Brown to the Chois, Brown\nsaid that “Dennis” 4 was “close to settling 28 out of 32 of his cases with the IRS” and\n“[a]lthough there will be penalties, some or all of it will be recaptured in your 2007\ndeduction.” Brown explained that Dennis “believes that American General will come\nforward with some kind of favorable offer that will offset some of the penalty as well,”\nand although he could not provide “exact numbers,” “some kind of resolution” seemed to\nbe close, at which point they would need “to talk about getting the policies out of the plan\nper the original strategy.” Mr. Choi expressed some relief in response, stating that he\nhoped “settlement is neared, and we don’t have to pay any penalties that will be our\nultimate goal.” Brown then responded, “Dennis said you probably will have to pay\npenalties—i.e. write a check to the IRS, but it will be made up in a subsequent deduction\nfor 2007 and some enhancements to the insurance products if American General steps up\nto the plate.” In the continued e-mail exchange, Mr. Choi stated that he was “expecting\nAG [American General] to step up to the plate to take care [of] the penalties. As you are\naware, they sold this bad product to us without any legitimacy approval from the IRS,\nand have clients claimed all the tax deductions. That’s really got us upset.” Brown\nresponded, “Dennis seemed very confident that American General will do the right thing,\n       4\n        Defendants Brown and Roberson apparently referred plaintiffs to third parties\nDennis Cunning and Pension Professionals of America to administer the 412(i) Plan and\nhelp respond to the IRS audit. Several documents that plaintiffs cite in support of their\narguments on appeal, including those that were not timely submitted in opposition to the\nmotion for summary judgment (see Discussion section II.C.1., post), include\ncommunications with Dennis Cunning.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fbut I don’t want to be overly optimistic at this point. As you know, it’s all hot air until\nit’s in writing.”\n       According to defendants, the Chois’ knowledge of indeterminate damages due to\nthe 412(i) Plan as of September 2007 was sufficient, under the relevant case law, to\ntrigger the statute of limitations on all of plaintiffs’ claims.\n       Plaintiffs opposed the motion for summary judgment on each of the asserted\ngrounds, including the statute of limitations defense, and purported to dispute most of\ndefendants’ 32 material facts by citing their “Statement of Facts and Opposing Evidence\nBelow Applicable to Motion Generally Nos. 33-105.” They asserted that the November\n2006 letter from the IRS merely informed them that the 412(i) Plan would be audited, and\nthat a threat or possibility of damages is insufficient to complete the cause of action and\ntrigger the statute of limitations. Rather, they contended that damages did not begin to\naccrue until at least 2009, when the audit and negotiations with the IRS concluded, and\nback taxes and penalties began to be assessed. For factual support, plaintiffs referenced\ntheir proffered, material facts Nos. 33-105 (comprising three volumes of evidence\ntotaling about 1,000 pages).\n       The trial court issued a tentative ruling to grant defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment on the statute of limitations defense. The court found that undisputed evidence\nshowed plaintiffs “were on notice of the IRS penalties imposed on them no later than\nSeptember 2007.” Specifically, plaintiffs “were aware that the IRS would be seeking\npenalties and . . . were looking to others to cover those penalties.” The court rejected\nplaintiffs’ argument that damages did not accrue until completion of the audit in 2009.\nCiting the two-year and three-year statutes of limitations applicable to plaintiffs’ causes\nof action, the court concluded that the action, filed in November 2010, was time-barred.\n       The trial court indicated that it also would grant American General’s motion for\nsummary judgment on the cross-complaint, since there was “no basis for liability against\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fdefendants in the complaint, there [were] no triable issues of fact with respect to”\ndefendants’ claims for indemnity, contribution, and comparative fault.\n       Plaintiffs contested the tentative ruling. At the hearing, plaintiffs filed a notice of\nerrata and requested leave to file a motion to amend their separate statement in opposition\nto defendants’ summary judgment motion. The notice of errata sought to correct the\ninadvertent omission of two deposition exhibits from plaintiffs’ evidence filed in support\nof their opposition. Plaintiffs’ counsel explained that the omitted exhibits were a “key\npiece of evidence” showing that defendants, in their capacity as financial advisors, had\nadvised plaintiffs to be patient and not file lawsuits because defendants’ attorneys were\noptimistic about the audit and defendants were going to cover some lawyers’ fees as well.\nHe argued that plaintiffs should be allowed to submit additional evidence of\ncommunications between the Chois and defendants regarding the IRS audit and\nnegotiations, to contravene defendants’ assertion that the Chois were aware of damages\nin September 2007.\n       Regarding the statute of limitations defense, plaintiffs pointed out that the\nSeptember 2007 e-mail did not confirm they would suffer damages, because Brown\nexpressed hope that some or all penalties could be recaptured in 2007 deductions or\ncovered by American General. More broadly, they argued that the limitations defense\nrelated only to the damages arising from tax penalties and the audit, whereas plaintiffs’\nclaims encompassed other damages that accrued later. Plaintiffs objected that\ndefendants’ “very narrow motion should not dismiss everything else that’s in the\ncomplaint.”\n       The trial court rejected plaintiffs’ attempt to introduce evidence and legal theories\nthat were not included in the written opposition and explained that it would adopt its\ntentative ruling. The court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants\nand American General reflected the same reasoning set forth in the tentative, based on the\nconclusion that plaintiffs’ action was time-barred. The court thus declined to address\n\n                                              8\n\fdefendants’ objections to evidence or the other grounds raised in support of the summary\njudgment motion. The court entered judgment for defendants and against plaintiffs on\nAugust 21, 2014. The court simultaneously entered judgment for American General and\nagainst defendants as cross-complainants. Plaintiffs timely appealed the judgment\nagainst them on October 16, 2014. Defendants, as cross-complainants, appealed the\njudgment on that same day.\n                                   II.   DISCUSSION\n\n  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no triable issues of material fact\nsuch that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all causes of\naction. (§ 437c; Schachter v. Citigroup, Inc. (2009) 47 Cal.4th 610, 618 (Schachter).)\n       We review an order granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same\nthree-step analysis as the trial court. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th\n826, 860; Pipitone v. Williams (2016) 244 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1449 (Pipitone).) First, we\nidentify the causes of action framed by the pleadings. Second, we determine whether the\nmoving party has satisfied its burden of showing the causes of action have no merit\nbecause one or more elements cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense\nto that cause of action. Third, if the moving party has made a prima facie showing that it\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the burden of production shifts and we review\nwhether the party opposing summary judgment has provided evidence of a triable issue\nof material fact as to the cause of action or a defense. (§ 437c, subds. (o), (p)(2);\nPipitone, supra, at p. 1449.) A party opposing summary judgment may not “rely upon\nthe mere allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must set forth “specific facts” beyond\nthe pleadings to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact. (§ 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2).) The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty. (Schachter, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 618.)\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f  B. GROUNDS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n       The trial court granted summary judgment based solely on the statute of\nlimitations. Plaintiffs contend that the court erred, both as to its determination of when\nthe statute of limitations began to run on plaintiffs’ claims and as to which claims were\naffected. Defendants dispute plaintiffs’ interpretation of when a cause of action accrues\nand argue that plaintiffs improperly rely on evidence and arguments that were not before\nthe trial court. 5 Defendants further contend that the summary judgment was proper in\nany event, based on grounds raised in the motion that the trial court declined to address,\nand given plaintiffs’ procedurally defective opposition. Plaintiffs respond that it would\nbe error for this court to decide issues not considered by the trial court, including\ndefendants’ alternate grounds for summary judgment and the sufficiency of plaintiffs’\nresponsive separate statement of material facts.\n       Because we will affirm the grant of summary judgment based solely on the statute\nof limitations, we need not address any alternate grounds argued in defendants’ motion. 6\nWe note, however, that whether plaintiffs’ responsive separate statement of material facts\nconformed to applicable rules is not beyond our immediate review. It is implicit in the\ntrial court’s finding that defendants “provided undisputed evidence” of the material facts\n\n       5\n          We requested supplemental briefing on whether two legal theories raised in\nplaintiffs’ opening brief had been forfeited and have considered the parties’ responses in\nour analysis.\n        6\n          If this court were to reach any of the grounds not relied upon by the trial court,\nsection 437c, subdivision (m)(2) requires only that we “afford the parties an opportunity\nto present their views on the issue by submitting supplemental briefs.” It does not mean\nthis court cannot decide issues that were briefed for the trial court and addressed by both\nsides on appeal. (See, e.g., Bains v. Moores (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 445, 471, fn. 39\n[purpose of supplemental briefing “fully met” where the parties addressed alternative\nground for summary judgment in response and reply briefs]; California School of\nCulinary Arts v. Lujan (2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 16, 22 [“ ‘appellate court may affirm a\nsummary judgment on any correct legal theory, as long as the parties had an adequate\nopportunity to address the theory in the trial court’ ”].)\n\n\n                                             10\n\fsupporting the statute of limitations defense that the court considered and rejected\nplaintiffs’ dispute of those facts. This is unsurprising, since plaintiffs purported to\ndispute defendants’ material facts by referring the court generally to the voluminous body\nof opposing evidence. Plaintiffs’ responsive statement fell short of the requirement to\nfollow each disputed material fact with “a reference to the supporting evidence” (§ 437c,\nsubd. (b)(3); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1350(f)(2), (3)), essentially leaving those facts\nuncontroverted. (California School of Culinary Arts v. Lujan, supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at\np. 22 [“ ‘Without a separate statement of undisputed facts with references to supporting\nevidence in the form of affidavits or declarations, it is impossible for the [opposing party]\nto demonstrate the existence of disputed facts.’ ” (italics added)]; Collins v. Hertz Corp.\n(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 64, 75 [It is the duty of the party opposing the summary\njudgment motion “to direct the court to evidence that supports their claims. It is not the\ncourt’s duty to rummage through the papers to construct or resuscitate their case”].)\n  C. ANALYSIS\n       The crux of plaintiffs’ claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in finding that\nthe September 2007 e-mail exchange between Brown and the Chois apprised the Chois of\ndamages based on IRS penalties. Plaintiffs argue that the e-mail exchange, at most, put\nthe Chois on notice that damages might occur in the future, depending on factors\nincluding the pending IRS audit, the offset of penalties with 2007 tax deductions, and the\npossibility that American General might cover certain costs. Plaintiffs argue that the\ncourt’s finding that plaintiffs were “on notice” of damages contravenes the principle that\nthe possibility of future damages does not commence running of the statute of limitations.\n       Plaintiffs further argue that even if the September 2007 e-mail exchange\nconstituted notice of damages, the court erred in failing to consider whether the fiduciary\nrelationship between the Chois and defendants as their investment advisors tolled the\nstatute of limitations or lessened plaintiffs’ burden to discover the wrongful conduct. In\nsupport of this argument—and for added context around the Chois’ understanding of the\n\n                                              11\n\fSeptember 2007 e-mail—plaintiffs rely on late-filed evidentiary submissions that the trial\ncourt rejected. Plaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred in failing to determine\nwhether knowledge of IRS penalties as of September 2007 triggered the statute of\nlimitations as to each independent cause of action alleged in the complaint.\n       We first address plaintiffs’ efforts to supplement the evidence and invoke legal\ntheories that were not included in their written opposition to the motion for summary\njudgment. We then consider plaintiffs’ statute of limitations arguments.\n\n            1. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Refusing to Consider\n               Plaintiffs’ Tardy Submissions\n       On the day of the summary judgment hearing, plaintiffs sought to supplement the\nrecord with evidence to bolster their arguments opposing the statute of limitations\ndefense. In a notice of errata, plaintiffs’ counsel declared that two deposition exhibits\nhad been inadvertently omitted. Counsel explained that the exhibits were not new\nevidence, because defendants had attended the deposition using those exhibits and had\nnotice of their content based on plaintiffs’ responsive separate statement.\n       Plaintiffs also requested leave to file a motion to amend their separate statement.\nThey maintained that if the trial court was inclined to grant summary judgment on the\nstatute of limitations issue, “[i]t would be gravely prejudicial to Plaintiffs to not consider\nevidence that highlights Defendants’ continuing legal advice to Plaintiffs, as well as\ninstructions not to pursue litigation. Plaintiffs’ reliance on the advice of Defendants and\nDefendants’ counsel to forbear litigation against Defendants tolls the statute of\nlimitations.”\n       The trial court refused both requests and rejected plaintiffs’ legal arguments that\nrelied on the late-filed evidence. The court observed that a “very substantial part of the\nargument presented this morning is based on a legal theory that’s nowhere in the\nopposition. Defendants haven’t heard it before. They haven’t had a chance to think\nabout it, to reflect on the facts on which the plaintiffs are relying, many of which were\n\n\n                                              12\n\fnot in the record until today, and the legal authorities that the plaintiffs are presenting\nnow for the first time. [¶] So that is not appropriate.” Plaintiffs filed objections to the\ndenial of leave to amend and attached the excluded evidence, arguing that the additional\nevidence “would have further bolstered Plaintiffs’ contention that a triable issue of fact\nexisted in light of the Court’s tentative ruling.”\n       On appeal, plaintiffs rely in part on several of the late-filed exhibits and argue that\nthe trial court “had discretion to and should have considered these additional documents.”\nThey suggest that since the statute of limitations argument “constituted a very small part”\nof the motion for summary judgment—comprising only one of five issues to be\nadjudicated—“it was not unreasonable” for plaintiffs to seek leave to introduce additional\nevidence bearing on that defense, given the trial court’s tentative ruling. Yet plaintiffs\ncite no legal authority to support the contention that the court erred in refusing to\nconsider the evidence and related arguments.\n       The exhibits appended to plaintiffs’ notice of errata and motion to amend the\nresponsive separate statement—filed on the day of the hearing—were untimely. A party\nmust file and serve opposition to a motion for summary judgment “not less than 14 days”\nprior to the scheduled hearing, “unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.”\n(§ 437c, subd. (b)(2).) Defendants point out that due to time extensions, plaintiffs had\n“approximately 221 days” to oppose the motion for summary judgment, far more than the\nprescribed period to file opposition under the statute. (Id., subds. (a)(2), (b)(2).) When\npressed by the trial court to explain the tardy submissions, plaintiffs’ counsel stated that\n“key” evidence in the notice of errata was omitted due to clerical error, and the evidence\nand arguments in the motion for leave to amend were “not in the brief” but were\ndiscussed “in a broad context as far as the allegations.” He explained, “We’re putting it\nbefore the Court today. . . . We didn’t realize the Court would grasp on to [the statute of\nlimitations issue].”\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       On this showing, we are not persuaded that the trial court erred. “Good cause\nmust be shown to the satisfaction of the trial court before supplemental material may be\nfiled after the statutory deadline . . . .” (Hobson v. Raychem Corp. (1999) 73 Cal.App.4th\n614, 624, disapproved on other grounds by Colmenares v. Braemar Country Club, Inc.\n(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1019.) Furthermore, “case law has been strict in requiring good cause\nto be shown before late filed papers will be accepted.” (Hobson v. Raychem Corp.,\nsupra, at p. 625 [citing example in which counsel for the party opposing summary\njudgment was retained only one day before the hearing].) The trial court considered and\nrejected plaintiffs’ requests to submit additional evidence, noting the failure to comply\nwith statutory requirements and the unfairness to defendants. This was a proper exercise\nof the court’s discretion. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs’ references to any of the\nlate-filed evidence in support of their arguments on appeal.\n\n            2. The Statute of Limitations Period on Plaintiffs’ Claims Commenced\n               Upon Inquiry Notice of Wrongful Conduct Causing Damages\n       The thrust of plaintiffs’ complaint is that defendants wrongly advised the Chois to\nestablish the section 412(i) Plan despite known risks and increasing IRS scrutiny, causing\nplaintiffs to suffer financial losses, back taxes, and government penalties. Plaintiffs’\nclaims sound in tort and are subject to a two- or three-year statute of limitations. 7 If the\n\n       7\n          Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in considering any statute of\nlimitations other than section 338, which defendants expressly cited in their answer.\nPlaintiffs are correct that a defendant who pleads the statute of limitations by reference to\nthe statute must specify the section and, if applicable, particular subdivision(s). (§ 458;\nBrown v. World Church (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 684, 691.) Failure to do so may waive\nthe defense. (Martin v. Van Bergen (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 84, 91.) Yet plaintiffs did\nnot object to the defective pleading by demurrer or otherwise raise this argument before\nthe trial court, either in opposition to the motion for summary judgment or by objection to\nthe trial court’s tentative ruling. While section 458 has been strictly construed,\n“[e]nforcement of that rule . . . depends upon the diligence with which the opposing party\nobjects to the pleading defect by way of demurrer or otherwise.” (Coy v. County of Los\nAngeles (1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1077, 1086, fn. 5; Davenport v. Stratton (1944) 24\n(continued)\n\n                                              14\n\ftrial court correctly determined that plaintiffs’ notice of damages was sufficient as of\nSeptember 2007 to assert their causes of action against defendants, then plaintiffs’\nNovember 2010 complaint was time-barred.\n       “ ‘Statute of limitations’ is the collective term applied to acts or parts of acts that\nprescribe the periods beyond which a plaintiff may not bring a cause of action.” (Fox v.\nEthicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. (2005) 35 Cal.4th 797, 806 (Fox).) “A plaintiff must bring a\nclaim within the limitations period after accrual of the cause of action.” (Ibid.; see\n§ 312.) “Generally speaking, a cause of action accrues at ‘the time when the cause of\naction is complete with all of its elements.’ ” (Fox, supra, at p. 806.) “ ‘ “ ‘Ordinarily\nthis is when the wrongful act is done and the obligation or the liability arises, but it does\nnot “accrue until the party owning it is entitled to begin and prosecute an action\nthereon.” ’ ” . . . In other words, ‘[a] cause of action accrues “upon the occurrence of the\nlast element essential to the cause of action.” ’ ” ’ ” (County of Santa Clara v. Atlantic\nRichfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 316 (Atlantic Richfield), quoting Howard\nJarvis Taxpayers Assn. v. City of La Habra (2001) 25 Cal.4th 809, 815.)\n       If the last element to occur in a tort action is damages, “the statute of limitations\nbegins to run on the occurrence of ‘appreciable and actual harm, however uncertain in\namount,’ that consists of more than nominal damages.” (San Francisco Unified School\nDist. v. W.R. Grace & Co. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1318, 1325-1326 (SFUSD); accord\nAtlantic Richfield, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 317; see, e.g., Davies v. Krasna (1975) 14\nCal.3d 502, 513 [in action for negligence, breach of duty “ ‘causing only nominal\ndamages, speculative harm, or the threat of future harm—not yet realized’ normally ‘does\n\nCal.2d 232, 247-248 [explaining waiver based on failure to raise the sufficiency of the\nplea by demurrer to the answer, or at trial]; see also Corrigan v. Stiltz (1965) 233\nCal.App.2d 381, 386 [noting it “was incumbent on” the party challenging the limitations\nbar “to object to the insufficiency of the sections pleaded either by demurrer to the\nanswer or by timely objection at the trial”].) Plaintiffs may not now, for the first time on\nappeal, object to defendants’ manner of pleading the statute of limitations defense.\n\n\n                                              15\n\fnot suffice to create a cause of action . . .’ ”].) It is “the fact of damage rather than the\namount [that] is the relevant consideration” in determining the existence of “actual\nharm.” (Adams v. Paul (1995) 11 Cal.4th 583, 589 (Adams).)\n       But a cause of action does not accrue, and the limitations period does not begin to\nrun, “until the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the cause of action.”\n(Atlantic Richfield, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 317.) “Under the discovery rule,\nsuspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action, coupled with knowledge of\nany remaining elements, will generally trigger the statute of limitations period.” (Fox,\nsupra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 807.) In ascertaining suspicion or knowledge of the elements of a\ncause of action, courts “do not take a hypertechnical approach . . . . Rather than\nexamining whether the plaintiffs suspect facts supporting each specific legal element of a\nparticular cause of action, we look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect\nthat a type of wrongdoing has injured them.” (Ibid.)\n       “The resolution of a statute of limitations defense is typically a factual question for\nthe trier of fact. However, summary judgment is proper if the court can draw only one\nlegitimate inference from uncontradicted evidence about the limitations issue.” (SFUSD,\nsupra, 37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1325-1326; Adams, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 586 [determining\nwhen plaintiff suffered “manifest and palpable injury” generally raises a question of fact,\nbut may be resolved as a matter of law if the material facts are undisputed].)\n       As previously noted, defendants relied on two exhibits for their statute of\nlimitations defense: (1) the November 2006 letter from the IRS to Choice Instruments\ninforming plaintiffs of specific defects in the 412(i) Plan and recommending that\nplaintiffs “unwind the plan and distribute the policies” or treat the Plan as subject to\nInternal Revenue Code section 412, and (2) the September 2007 e-mail between Brown\nand plaintiffs informing them that “there will be penalties . . . .” The parties primarily\ndispute the effect of the September 2007 e-mail.\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Plaintiffs acknowledge that in the e-mail, Brown notified the Chois that the IRS\nintended to impose penalties on them. But they argue that when read in its entirety, the\ne-mail communicated Brown’s expectation that some or all penalties would be recaptured\nin the Chois’ 2007 deduction, and American General would offer to improve the\ninsurance products in order to avoid financial loss to the Chois. Plaintiffs argue that Mr.\nChoi’s response reflected these assurances, and the fact that penalties had not been\nassessed shows that damages remained uncertain, as did any indication that defendants\nhad acted wrongfully. Plaintiffs posit that the September 2007 e-mail presented, at best,\na triable issue of material fact regarding whether the Chois were “on notice” of actual and\npresent damages, given speculation about the outcome of the IRS audit. Defendants\nrespond that while the amount of damages was unknown, the September 2007 e-mail\nprovides undisputed evidence that plaintiffs were aware of the existence of damages,\nwhich under well-established case authority completes the cause of action and triggers\nthe limitations period.\n       Our resolution of this question turns on what constitutes notice of “ ‘appreciable\nand actual harm’ ” (SFUSD, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1326) in the financial or\ninvestment advising context when the ultimate, financial outcome remains indeterminate\neven while the imposition of penalties appears certain. Viewing the September 2007\ne-mail exchange in the light most favorable to plaintiffs (Schachter, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\np. 618), we nevertheless conclude that plaintiffs had “reason to at least suspect” that\ndefendants’ advice to establish the 412(i) Plan, weighted toward life insurance and\ndependent on deductions and features like “springing” cash values, had harmed them.\n(Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 807.) Our conclusion traces the case law addressing when\nthe injury element of a tort cause of action is complete, causing the cause of action to\naccrue and the limitations period to commence.\n       We begin with International Engine Parts, Inc. v. Feddersen & Co. (1995) 9\nCal.4th 606 (Feddersen), in which the California Supreme Court adopted a bright-line\n\n                                             17\n\frule for determining the timing of actual injury in an accountant malpractice action.\nFeddersen held that “actual injury, caused by an accountant’s negligent filing of tax\nreturns” occurs when “the IRS actually assesses the tax deficiency.” (Id. at p. 608.) The\ncourt explained that based on IRS procedures for the examination of tax returns and\nassessment of deficiencies, findings prior to the penalty assessment “are merely proposed\nfindings, subject to review and negotiation.” (Id. at p. 609.) While noting that other\n“palpable harm caused by the malpractice of the accountant” might accrue prior to\nfinalization of the audit, the court reasoned that such harm would be “based on a tentative\nassessment of potential liability only” and thus would not constitute “actual harm until\nthe date of the deficiency tax assessment or finality of the audit process.” (Id. at p. 620.)\n       Plaintiffs argue that because the September 2007 e-mail informed the Chois that\nthe IRS audit was ongoing and the amount of penalties and any potential offset were\nunknown, the reasoning of Feddersen should apply here. Plaintiffs maintain that there is\nno principled basis to distinguish between applying the statute of limitations in the\ncontext of IRS audit proceedings caused by negligent tax preparation and identical\nproceedings caused by faulty investment advice. Similar attempts to apply Feddersen in\nnon-tax preparation cases, however, have been rejected by subsequent case authority.\n       For example, in Sahadi v. Scheaffer (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 704, this court\nexamined the limits of Feddersen’s application in another accounting malpractice\nscenario. The court observed that “[t]he Supreme Court has subsequently (in a legal\nmalpractice case) stated that Feddersen involved ‘very narrowly drawn circumstances’\nand ‘did not articulate a “rule for all seasons.” ’ ” (Id. at p. 718, quoting Adams, supra,\n11 Cal.4th at p. 588.) The high court reiterated this view in Jordache Enterprises, Inc. v.\nBrobeck, Phleger & Harrison (1998) 18 Cal.4th 739, 763 (Jordache), stating that\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f“Feddersen presented specialized circumstances and did not articulate a rule of broad or\ngeneral applicability.” 8\n       Other Court of Appeal decisions reflect the consensus that Feddersen’s bright-line\nrule applies to accounting malpractice actions for the negligent preparation of tax returns.\nIn Apple Valley Unified School Dist. v. Vavrinek, Trine, Day & Co. (2002) 98\nCal.App.4th 934 (Apple Valley), the court deemed it unsurprising that “subsequent\ndecisions have given Feddersen’s bright-line holding only narrow application,” since\nFeddersen “based its holding not on a conclusion that no actual injury occurs until there\nis a final IRS assessment, but on its determination that in the context of negligent tax\nreturn preparation, the need for uniformity overrides the usual considerations that dictate\nwhen the statute of limitations should be deemed to commence.” (Apple Valley, supra, at\np. 945.) Apple Valley involved an accounting malpractice action in which the plaintiff\nschool district claimed that misrepresentations in the defendant accountants’ audit report\nhad induced it to improperly provide state funds to a charter school. (Id. at p. 937.)\n\n       8\n         In fact, Jordache expressly overruled an earlier Supreme Court decision—also\ninvolving legal malpractice—that Feddersen relied on by analogy in identifying when a\nclient suffers “actual injury” in the context of an accountant’s negligent preparation of\nincome tax returns. (Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at pp. 762-763 [explaining that the\n“broad, categorical rule” for accrual of an attorney malpractice cause of action articulated\nin ITT Small Business Finance Corp. v. Niles (1994) 9 Cal.4th 245 “cannot be reconciled\nwith the particularized factual inquiry required to determine actual injury under” the\nlimitations statute for legal malpractice actions].) In Feddersen, the court examined the\nevolution of the “discovery plus actual injury” (Feddersen, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 615)\nrequirement in professional malpractice actions and relied in substantial part on ITT,\nexplaining that “the assessment of the tax deficiency is the equivalent of the settlement\n[of underlying litigation] in ITT, because the question whether the taxpayer suffered\nactual injury as a result of the accountant’s allegedly negligent preparation of the tax\nreturns is contingent on the outcome of the audit.” (Id. at p. 619.) Despite Feddersen’s\nreliance in part on ITT, the court in Jordache refrained from directly questioning\nFeddersen’s holding. (See Jordache, supra, at p. 764, fn. 10 [because Feddersen arose\nunder a different limitations provision and was not directed at legal malpractice actions,\n“we have no occasion in this case to reexamine Feddersen’s rationale or rule”].)\n\n\n                                             19\n\fThe trial court granted the defendants’ demurrer based on the statute of limitations,\nfinding that the school district became aware of the illegal charter school and suffered\nactual injury when it hired an accountant and attorney at or about that time. (Id. at\npp. 941-942.) On appeal, the school district contended in part that it did not suffer actual\ninjury until over two years later, when the state controller issued a report holding it\nresponsible for overpayments to the charter school; it urged that any liability for\noverpayments before that time “was merely speculative and could not constitute actual\ninjury.” (Id. at p. 944.)\n       After a detailed review of California Supreme Court and appellate court\njurisprudence on when professional negligence causes actual injury, the court elected not\nto extend the Feddersen rule to the accountants’ alleged, negligent misrepresentation.\n(Apple Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 944-947.) Rather, the court reasoned that the\nfact-specific inquiry articulated in Jordache for the timing of injury in a legal malpractice\naction “should apply except to cases which fall within Feddersen’s narrow holding\ngoverning negligent tax return preparation.” (Id. at p. 952.) Applying the Jordache\nanalysis of actual injury based on “whether the plaintiff has sustained damages\ncompensable in a malpractice action” (id. at p. 948), the court affirmed the trial court’s\nfinding that the district “suffered actual injury when it recognized the allegedly improper\napportionment payments to [the charter school] and incurred expenses in an attempt to\ndetermine the extent of the improper conduct.” (Id. at p. 953.)\n       In Van Dyke v. Dunker & Aced (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 446, 448 (Van Dyke)—an\naccountant malpractice action based on erroneous income tax advice—the court similarly\nconcluded that Feddersen’s bright-line rule for cases based on negligent preparation of\ntax returns “does not apply here.” The plaintiffs in Van Dyke allegedly relied on the\ndefendant accountant’s advice that donating a parcel of property to charity would offset\ntheir tax liability via a “ ‘dollar-for-dollar’ tax credit for the fair market value of the land\ndonated.” (Id. at p. 449.) The accountant later informed them that he had made a\n\n                                               20\n\fmistake about the tax credit and instead the plaintiffs would only get a tax deduction\nspread out over several years. (Ibid.) The plaintiffs paid taxes based on the deduction\nbut filed suit only a few years later, after another accountant reviewed the returns,\ndiscovered errors resulting in overpayment, and negotiated with the IRS for a partial\nrefund. (Id. at p. 450.) The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants,\nfinding that the statute of limitations began to run when the accountant informed the\nplaintiffs of his mistake and their resulting tax liability. (Id. at pp. 450, 452.)\n       On appeal, the Van Dyke plaintiffs argued that their cause of action did not accrue\nuntil the completion of negotiations, when the IRS “finally determined” their tax\nobligations. (Van Dyke, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 452.) In declining to apply\nFeddersen, the court explained: “The propriety of the tax advice [the plaintiffs]\nreceived . . . was not contingent on the outcome of the IRS audit. There was nothing\nspeculative about the damages they suffered in 1991 as a result of the alleged erroneous\nadvice regarding the benefits of donating their property to a charitable organization. The\ndetermination by the IRS in 1994 regarding [the plaintiffs]’ 1990 tax liability merely\nresolved the extent of their loss.” (Id. at p. 455.) Comparing the injury in Van Dyke to\nthe immediate “ ‘loss of a right, remedy, or interest, or in the imposition of a liability’ ”\nin cases where the plaintiff entered into an unfavorable agreement due to poor legal\nadvice, the court explained that “ ‘there has been actual injury regardless of whether\nfuture events may affect the permanency of the injury or the amount of monetary\ndamages eventually incurred.’ ” (Id. at p. 457.)\n       Plaintiffs offer no persuasive justification to depart from Apple Valley, Van Dyke,\nand the Supreme Court’s own authority, including Adams and Jordache—all cases that\nrejected proposals to extend Feddersen’s bright-line rule for determining “actual injury”\nto claims based on conduct other than the negligent preparation of tax returns. Moreover,\nplaintiffs’ argument that commencement of the statute of limitations in the context of IRS\naudit proceedings related to faulty investment advice need not differ from the context of\n\n                                               21\n\faudit proceedings related to negligent tax preparation obscures a key difference: whether\nactual injury is contingent on the outcome of the IRS audit process. It may be that actual\ninjury results from an accountant’s allegedly negligent preparation of tax returns only as\ndetermined by an IRS audit (Feddersen, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 619), but the same cannot\nbe said for more wide-ranging categories of negligent tax-related or investment advice.\n(See, e.g., Van Dyke, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 455 [propriety of tax advice and\nresulting injury not contingent on outcome of IRS audit].)\n       Because Feddersen’s bright-line rule does not dictate when the statute of\nlimitations began to run on plaintiffs’ causes of action in this case, our determination is\ngoverned by the general rules articulated in Jordache and later in Fox, and applied in\nApple Valley and Van Dyke. Plaintiffs do not seriously dispute that they had reason to\nsuspect negligent conduct causing loss or damage as of the September 2007 e-mail\nexchange, but contend that the damage had not manifested and any anticipated damages\nwere too uncertain and speculative to constitute actual injury. (See Apple Valley, supra,\n98 Cal.App.4th at p. 942 [statute of limitations “begins to run when (1) the aggrieved\nparty discovers the negligent conduct causing the loss or damage and (2) the aggrieved\nparty has suffered actual injury as a result of the negligent conduct”].)\n       Certainly, as of the September 2007 e-mail, plaintiffs “discover[ed] or should have\ndiscovered” (Atlantic Richfield, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 317) that defendants’ advice\nhad led them to trouble. The November 2006 notice from the IRS informed them of\nsignificant “defects” 9 in the 412(i) Plan that defendants had advised them to establish and\n\n       9\n         The listed defects identified those characteristics of the Plan that plaintiffs allege\ndefendants represented would bring them substantial financial value and were “ ‘bullet\nproof.’ ” The IRS identified the defects as “1. Listed Transaction under Revenue Ruling\n2004-20 [¶] 2. Springing Cash Values [¶] 3. Exchange Rights for a policy with higher\nvalue [¶] 4. Values provided by the contracts significantly exceed amounts needed for\nbenefits under the Plan (including IRC 415) [¶] 5. Excessive surrender/expense charges\n[¶] 6. No separate agreement for flexible premium deferred annuity contracts [¶]\n(continued)\n\n                                              22\n\frecommended that they “unwind the plan and distribute the policies” or treat it as a 412\nPlan. The September 2007 e-mail informed the Chois that there would be IRS penalties\nbut reflected cautious optimism that the penalties would be offset in other ways,\nincluding a deduction and “some kind of favorable offer” if American General “steps up\nto the plate.” Mr. Choi responded, “I am expecting [American General] to step up to the\nplate to take care [of] the penalties. As you are aware, they sold this bad product to us\nwithout any legitimacy approval from the IRS, and have clients claimed all the tax\ndeductions. That’s really got us upset.”\n       Contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion that “there was no certainty” that the Chois “knew\nof Defendants’ wrongful acts,” this exchange satisfies the requirement under the\ndiscovery rule that “[a] plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she\n‘has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.’ ” (Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th\nat p. 807.) Based on Mr. Choi’s response to Brown, plaintiffs recognized that the policies\nthey bought under the 412(i) Plan were compromised and would require payment of\npenalties—though they hoped and insisted that they would not have to pay. Given that\nthe defects in the 412(i) Plan identified by the IRS directly matched those elements of the\nPlan that were supposed to generate a high cash value, confirmation the following year\nthat the IRS would impose penalties was more than adequate to trigger suspicion not only\nregarding the impending penalties, but regarding the promised benefits of the 412(i) Plan.\n       Generally, once plaintiffs “have reason to at least suspect that a type of\nwrongdoing has injured them,” the cause of action begins to accrue. (Fox, supra, 35\nCal.4th at p. 807.) The plaintiffs at that point “are required to conduct a reasonable\ninvestigation . . . , and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have\nbeen revealed by such an investigation.” (Id. at p. 808.) There is no indication that the\n\n\n7. Non-level premiums [¶] 8. Benefits provided by the contracts are not equal to the\nbenefit provided by the plan under one or more forms.”\n\n\n                                             23\n\fduty to investigate applies differently when the element in question is that of damages, or\nmore specifically, the extent thereof. It is often repeated that “the limitations period\nbegins once the plaintiff ‘ “ ‘has notice or information of circumstances to put a\nreasonable person on inquiry . . . .’ ” ’ [Citations.] A plaintiff need not be aware of the\nspecific ‘facts’ necessary to establish the claim; that is a process contemplated by pretrial\ndiscovery. Once the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing, and therefore an incentive\nto sue, she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights. So long as a suspicion\nexists, it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts; she cannot wait for the facts to\nfind her.” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) 44 Cal.3d 1103, 1110-1111 (Jolly).)\n       Here, plaintiffs were aware of facts that should have put them on inquiry notice of\nthe cause or causes of action arising from defendants’ investment advice. (Jolly, supra,\n44 Cal.3d at pp. 1110-1111; Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 807.) Specifically as to\n“ ‘appreciable and actual harm’ ” (Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 748) or the “ ‘actual\ninjury’ ” (ibid.) element of the tort cause of action, “the fact of damage, not the amount”\nserves as the relevant metric. (Id. at p. 743; Adams, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 589.) As\ndefined in Jordache, “[a]ctual injury refers only to the legally cognizable damage\nnecessary to assert the cause of action.” (Jordache, supra, at p. 752.)\n       The IRS’s notice to plaintiffs in November 2006 of numerous defects in their\n412(i) Plan and the need to unwind or otherwise alter the Plan structure raised suspicion\nabout plaintiffs’ ability to realize the promised value of their insurance investments. The\nSeptember 2007 e-mail certainly indicated “legally cognizable damage” (Jordache,\nsupra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 752) in the form of IRS penalties, which appeared certain even\nwhile the ultimate financial impact was unknown. This went beyond “speculative and\ncontingent injuries,” which “are those that do not yet exist, as when an attorney’s error\ncreates only a potential for harm in the future.” (Id. at p. 754.) Brown’s inability to\nprovide “exact numbers” and hedging on whether the penalties would be “recaptured” in\na deduction or potentially “offset” by American General did not consign the fact of\n\n                                               24\n\fdamages to that of potential future harm not yet realized. Rather, the evidence shows that\nthe propriety of defendants’ advice regarding the 412(i) Plan, and the fact of damages,\nwere ascertainable, even if “future events” might have affected the permanency of the\ninjury “or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.” (Ibid.)\n       We recognize that defendants did not show that plaintiffs had incurred calculable\ndamages as of September 2007. On that basis, plaintiffs contrast their circumstances\nupon learning of impending IRS penalties with the “actual injury” in Van Dyke, which as\nnoted earlier, accrued when the plaintiffs transferred their property based on the\naccountant’s faulty advice and were assessed higher taxes than expected. (Van Dyke,\nsupra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 455.) Plaintiffs argue that Van Dyke supports a finding of no\nactual injury here, because no penalty assessment or tax had yet occurred. The facts in\nApple Valley could support a similar argument, insofar as the school district had already\npaid state apportionment funds to the charter school and later incurred out-of-pocket\nlosses by paying investigation and legal fees. (Apple Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 946-947.)\n       However, by the time plaintiffs learned that the IRS’s adverse assessment of the\n412(i) Plan would result in penalties, neither the lack of a numeric assessment nor the\nhope of offset by another source negated the fact that plaintiffs were on notice of actual\ninjury. Not only had plaintiffs already invested substantial money into the program, but\nBrown told them they would have to pay IRS penalties, and the IRS had notified them\nthat the 412(i) Plan components promising springing cash value and exchange rights for a\nhigher-value policy were defective. As the Supreme Court reiterated in Jordache,\n“ ‘[t]he mere breach of a professional duty, causing only nominal damages, speculative\nharm, or the threat of future harm—not yet realized—does not suffice to create a cause of\naction for negligence.’ ” (Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 750.) But “the existence of\nappreciable actual injury does not depend on the plaintiff’s ability to attribute a\nquantifiable sum of money to consequential damages.” (Ibid.)\n\n                                             25\n\f       Plaintiffs’ reliance on SFUSD, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th 1318, is misplaced because\nthe distinction in that case between the threat of future harm and appreciable harm\nforming the damages element of the strict liability or negligence cause of action rested on\nthe unique nature of the harm at issue—that of asbestos contamination in buildings. (Id.\nat p. 1330 [“Physical injury resulting from asbestos contamination, not the mere presence\nof asbestos, must have occurred before a cause of action for strict liability or negligence\ncan accrue in an asbestos-in-building case”].) By contrast, plaintiffs’ economic\ninvestment in the 412(i) Plan was subject to actual and appreciable harm once the IRS\nassigned defects to the Plan and plaintiffs learned they would be subject to penalties. As\nbetween “an actual, existing injury that might be remedied or reduced in the future, and a\nspeculative or contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future” (Jordache,\nsupra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 754), the former applies here. The Chois knew they were being\ninjured in some amount but aspired for a remedy or reduction to the injury through a\nthird-party representative’s negotiations with the IRS and potential remedial changes to\nthe American General policies. We conclude under these circumstances that plaintiffs\nhad knowledge of harm to their financial interest sufficient to trigger inquiry notice and\nto support a legally cognizable claim for damages.\n\n            3. The Statute of Limitations Period Was Not Tolled While Plaintiffs and\n               Defendants Cooperatively Challenged the IRS Assessment of the Plan\n       Plaintiffs contend that even if the September 2007 e-mail constituted notice of\nactual damages, causing the action to accrue, longstanding tolling rules applicable to\nprofessions including lawyers and doctors dictate that the statute of limitations does not\nrun in favor of a fiduciary while the fiduciary relationship continues. Plaintiffs urge us to\napply the rule here, where defendants continued to advise and advocate on behalf of the\nChois during the IRS audit of the 412(i) Plan. Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in\nfailing to consider the continuing relationship between plaintiffs and defendants while\nthey cooperatively sought to defeat or minimize IRS penalties. Defendants respond that\n\n\n                                             26\n\fplaintiffs improperly seek to raise this argument for the first time on appeal. They argue\nthat even if a fiduciary relationship existed between plaintiffs and defendants, no legal\nauthority supports plaintiffs’ contention that the statute of limitations was tolled while the\nparties cooperatively tried to minimize plaintiffs’ damages.\n       We note that although plaintiffs did not raise the tolling argument in their\nopposition papers before the trial court, their counsel argued at the hearing that\ndefendants “are estopped from claiming statute of limitations.” (See Brown v. Bleiberg\n(1982) 32 Cal.3d 426, 438 [noting “the rationale of the tolling doctrine is estoppel”].) In\nsupport, counsel cited certain exhibits purporting to show defendants reassuring the\nChois, before and after September 2007, that they should not act on or worry about the\nIRS audit, since Pension Professionals and their lawyers were fighting the IRS on\nplaintiffs’ behalf.10 The trial court, as explained ante, refused to consider the argument\nand cases that were not in plaintiffs’ opposition papers, deeming it unfair to defendants.\n       An appellate court ordinarily “will not consider an argument ‘raised in an appeal\nfrom a grant of summary judgment . . . if it was not raised below and requires\nconsideration of new factual questions.’ ” (Noe v. Superior Court (2015) 237\nCal.App.4th 316, 335 (Noe); Winchester Mystery House, LLC v. Global Asylum, Inc.\n\n\n       10\n           One of the exhibits cited by plaintiffs’ counsel appears to support our earlier\nconclusion that plaintiffs were subject to actual and appreciable harm as of September\n2007. (See ante, Discussion section II.C.2.) The evidence shows that plaintiffs, in\nAugust 2006, agreed to pay a $5,000 retainer and share up to a maximum of $12,500 in\nadditional legal fees with Pension Professionals to defend against the IRS audit,\nconstituting another form of cognizable legal damages caused by establishment of the\n412(i) Plan. (See Apple Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at p. 949 [finding the school\ndistrict’s “out-of-pocket expenses . . . incurred when it engaged its accountant and legal\ncounsel, in an effort to determine the extent of the improper payments and arrange for\nreimbursement of funds improperly received, constituted actual injury for limitations\npurposes”]; Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 761 [noting that the defendant’s “neglect\nrequired [the plaintiff] to pay defense costs in the Marciano action for years and to lose\ninvestment opportunities for those funds”].)\n\n\n                                             27\n\f(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 579, 594-595 (Winchester).) But we may “consider a newly\nraised issue ‘when [it] involves purely a legal question which rests on an uncontraverted\nrecord which could not have been altered by the presentation of additional evidence.’ ”\n(Noe, supra, at p. 335.) To the extent that plaintiffs’ tolling argument raises a purely\nlegal question and has been briefed by both sides on appeal, we may consider it. We\ndecline, however, to consider any disputed factual issues that were not properly before\nthe trial court, including evidence that plaintiffs sought to add to the record on the day of\nthe summary judgment hearing. (Winchester, supra, at pp. 594-595 [finding plaintiff had\nforfeited theory on appeal that was not argued to the trial court and required application\nof a legal test employing a series of factual determinations].)\n       Plaintiffs propose that so long as a financial advisor continues to advise the client\nor represent the client’s interest in the transaction that gives rise to legal claims, the\naction should be tolled until the advisor-client relationship has terminated. Plaintiffs\nconcede there is no specific statutory tolling provision for financial advisors, but argue\nthe rationale behind tolling in analogous circumstances applies equally here. For\nexample, the statute of limitations in an attorney malpractice action is tolled while “[t]he\nattorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which\nthe alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.” (§ 340.6, subd. (a)(2).)\n       In other cases, a confidential or fiduciary relationship between a defendant and a\nplaintiff will toll the statute of limitations. (Amtower v. Photon Dynamics, Inc. (2008)\n158 Cal.App.4th 1582, 1597 (Amtower); see United States Liab. Ins. Co. v.\nHaidinger-Hayes, Inc. (1970) 1 Cal.3d 586, 596 [explaining postponement of accrual in\ncases “where a fiduciary obligation is involved,” including actions against trustees,\nagents, accountants, and physicians].) The rationale is that “such relationships carry a\nduty of full disclosure and delaying accrual of the statute ‘prevents the fiduciary from\nobtaining immunity for an initial breach of duty by a subsequent breach of the obligation\nof disclosure.’ ” (Amtower, supra, at p. 1597, quoting Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy,\n\n                                               28\n\fCathcart & Gelfand (1971) 6 Cal.3d 176, 189.) For similar reasons, a defendant’s\nalleged fraud in concealing a cause of action may toll the statute of limitations “for that\nperiod during which the claim is undiscovered by plaintiff or until such time as plaintiff,\nby the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered it.” (Sanchez v. South\nHoover Hospital (1976) 18 Cal.3d 93, 99.) Still in other contexts, courts recognize the\neffect of a continuing fiduciary relationship not by tolling the statute of limitations, but\nby applying a reduced burden of discovery on the beneficiary. (Eisenbaum v. Western\nEnergy Resources, Inc. (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 314, 324 [insider-promotor selling limited\npartnership interest to subscriber “ ‘is entitled to rely upon the assumption that his\nfiduciary is acting in his behalf’ ”].)\n       Plaintiffs assert that the relationship between a client and financial planner or\ninvestment advisor is fiduciary as a matter of law (Hasso v. Hapke (2014) 227\nCal.App.4th 107, 140)—a proposition that defendants do not contradict and we accept for\nthe purpose of considering plaintiffs’ argument. 11 While plaintiffs did not allege tolling\nof the statute of limitations, the argument is framed by the allegation in the complaint that\ndefendants concealed and failed to disclose known risks as IRS scrutiny of the 412(i)\nPlans progressed, while attributing any fault to American General. Still, plaintiffs’\ncontention fails as a matter law for the reason previously stated: plaintiffs were on\ninquiry notice as of September 2007 of the facts constituting injury and indicating they\nhad received bad advice. Delayed accrual due to the fiduciary relationship does not\n\n       11\n          Fiduciary duties may be imposed by law, as in “ ‘certain technical, legal\nrelationships such as . . . trustees and beneficiaries, principals and agents, and attorneys\nand clients,’ ” or may be determined as a question of fact, based on the nature of the\nconfidential relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary duty under common law. (Hasso v.\nHapke, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 140 [referring to the investment advisor-client\nrelationship as fiduciary by law].) The statutory definition of investment advisor “also\nincludes any person who uses the title ‘financial planner’ . . .” and engages in the\nbusiness of advising others about investing in securities. (Corp. Code, § 25009,\nsubd. (b).)\n\n\n                                              29\n\fextend beyond the bounds of the discovery rule, which operates to protect the plaintiff\nwho “ ‘despite diligent investigation . . . is blamelessly ignorant of the cause of his\ninjuries’ ” and should not be barred from asserting a cause of action for wrongful conduct\n“ ‘before he could reasonably be expected to discover its existence.’ ” (E-Fab, Inc. v.\nAccountants, Inc. Services (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1308, 1318 (E-Fab).)\n       Here, the only conclusion to be drawn from the evidence leading up to and\nincluding the September 2007 e-mail is that plaintiffs were not shielded from the\nknowledge that the IRS was questioning the validity of 412(i) Plan, had identified\nmultiple defects that would require unwinding or conversion to another type of plan, and\nhad informed Cunning of forthcoming penalties. Plaintiffs, in fact, had agreed in August\n2006 to share the legal costs of defending against the IRS actions. Like in Amtower, in\nwhich we declined to apply the tolling principles to a scenario in which the defendants\nhad “disclosed the facts necessary to support” the plaintiff’s cause of action (Amtower,\nsupra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1597), we find that even assuming a fiduciary relationship\nbetween defendants and plaintiffs, plaintiffs as of September 2007 were aware of the\nfacts necessary to support their causes of action. We conclude that the nature of the\nrelationship between plaintiffs and defendants did not prevent or delay the Chois from\ndiscovering wrongdoing beyond September 2007.\n\n            4. Accrual of the Statute of Limitations Was Not Limited to a Single Cause\n               of Action or Damages Claim\n       Plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s application of the statute of limitations to bar\nthe entire action. They assert that they suffered “several different injuries arising out of\nmultiple instances of poor investment advice,” each of which represents an invasion of a\ndifferent primary right and constitutes a separate cause of action. Plaintiffs argue that\nbecause each injury alleged in the complaint is distinct and arises from separate, bad\nadvice, defendants failed to meet their initial burden on summary judgment by showing\nthat each distinct cause of action was barred by the limitations defense.\n\n\n                                              30\n\f       Like the tolling argument, this legal theory appears fully developed for the first\ntime on appeal. Plaintiffs’ written opposition to the summary judgment motion mentions\nnothing about causes of action left unaddressed by the defendants’ motion, although\nplaintiffs’ counsel did attempt to argue that point at the hearing. He maintained that\ndefendants took “a very simplistic and narrow view of the case” and ignored “a\nsubstantial part of the complaint and various allegations,” thereby failing to meet their\nprima facie burden “to dispose of an entire cause of action and not just to laser focus in\non tax advice and tax penalties.” These arguments go to the heart of defendants’ initial\nburden as the party moving for summary judgment to show that each cause of action,\n“even if not separately pleaded,” had no merit or was barred by a complete defense.\n(§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Consequently, we address the purely legal issue for the first time\non appeal. (Winchester, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at pp. 594-595.)\n       As a general proposition, plaintiffs are correct that under California’s “primary\nright” theory of code pleading, we determine the causes of action alleged in the complaint\n“based on the injury to the plaintiff, not on the legal theory or theories advanced to\ncharacterize it.” (Skrbina v. Fleming Companies (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1353, 1364\n(Skrbina); accord Crowley v. Katleman (1994) 8 Cal.4th 666, 681-682 (Crowley).)\n“Thus, if a plaintiff states several purported causes of action which allege an invasion of\nthe same primary right he has actually stated only one cause of action. On the other\nhand, if a plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s single wrongful act invaded two different\nprimary rights, he has stated two causes of action, and this is so even though the two\ninvasions are pleaded in a single count of the complaint.” (Skrbina, supra, at p. 1364.)\n       In support of their argument that the statute of limitations defense narrowly\naddressed injury only in the form of IRS penalties, plaintiffs seek to differentiate each\niteration of alleged harm and relate it to a different injury or primary right. For example,\nthey contend they were first damaged “based upon the advice regarding deductibility”\nwhen they converted their 412(i) Plan to a traditional 412 Plan and had to pay additional\n\n                                             31\n\fexcise tax because the deductions previously taken were not deductible under the 412\nPlan. They contend that they were separately damaged by defendants’ incorrect advice\nabout the need to file a form 8886 with their 2004 and 2005 tax returns—resulting in IRS\npenalties, and by advice that they would have an “irrevocable contractual right” to\npurchase certain universal life policies in year eight of the program—resulting in the loss\nof promised benefits when the policies were not available, and by advice to buy new life\ninsurance policies for the converted 412 Plan—resulting in a loss when those policies\nwere liquidated, and so on.\n       We are not persuaded by this piecemeal interpretation of injury post hoc. “The\nmost salient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the violation of a\nsingle primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action.” (Crowley, supra, 8 Cal.4th\nat p. 681.) It is, simply put, “the plaintiff’s right to be free from the particular injury\nsuffered.” (Ibid.) Viewed in these terms, “ ‘a cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary\nright’ of the plaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a wrongful act\nby the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.” (Ibid.) The gravamen of plaintiffs’\naction as framed by the complaint in this case was that defendants advised plaintiffs to\nestablish and fund a section 412(i) Plan with tax shelter features that, unsurprisingly,\ntriggered IRS penalties, back taxes, and required conversion to a traditional 412 Plan,\ncausing further economic losses due to disallowed deductions and lost insurance policy\nbenefits. Each claimed injury traces to, and is not distinct from, the same source of\nwrongful conduct—namely defendants’ bad advice concerning establishment of the\n412(i) Plan and purchase of the life insurance policies. The fact that plaintiffs pleaded\nmultiple legal theories of recovery, and that damages accrued in stages, does not\ntransform one primary right into many. “The manner in which a plaintiff elects to\norganize his or her claims within the body of the complaint is irrelevant to determining\nthe number of causes of action alleged under the primary right theory.” (Hindin v. Rust\n(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1247, 1257 (Hindin).)\n\n                                               32\n\f       Even more to the point, application of plaintiffs’ theory would be somewhat novel\nhere, given that the “primary right theory has a fairly narrow field of application” most\ncommonly invoked “when a plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce it in\ntwo suits.” (Crowley, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 682.) While we understand by analogy\nplaintiffs’ attempt to show distinct damages due to separate instances of poor advice\nalleged in the complaint (id. at p. 684 [court “not averse to drawing analogies from the\nprimary right theory when appropriate”]), plaintiffs’ claims are not divisible under the\nrubric proposed. If, hypothetically, plaintiffs had sought to enforce their purportedly\ndistinct claims for damages in separate law suits (such as by alleging negligence in one\nsuit and fraud in a second suit, or by alleging negligent advice regarding the section\n412(i) Plan in one suit and regarding conversion to the 412 Plan in the second suit), the\nlikely outcome would be a plea in abatement (if the first suit remained pending) or a\ndefense of res judicata (if the first suit had terminated on the merits). (Crowley, supra, at\np. 682; see, e.g., Johnson v. American Airlines, Inc. (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 427, 432-433\n[state court action was barred by previous federal class action because the primary right\nallegedly violated—to be free from employment discrimination based on sex—was the\nsame in both cases, even though the federal action alleged federal civil rights violations\nwhile the state action alleged violations of the California Constitution and state statutes].)\n       Plaintiffs’ citations to case authority do not suggest otherwise, but offer some\nguidance on assessing distinct and separate claims. In E-Fab, supra, 153 Cal.App.4th\n1308, the court addressed circumstances in which claims against the defendant accrued at\na different time than claims against a former employee. The plaintiff was the victim of\nembezzlement by the employee; the defendant accounting agency had recruited and\nplaced the employee with plaintiff upon representing that it had screened her background,\ncredentials, and references. (Id. at pp. 1313-1314.) In reviewing the grant of demurrer\non statute of limitations grounds, the court recognized that “the accrual trigger” for the\ncase against the defendant agency was the plaintiff’s discovery that it had misrepresented\n\n                                             33\n\fthe employee’s record and qualifications, not earlier notice of the employee’s fraud. (Id.\nat p. 1323.)\n       In Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 788, 792 (Pooshs), the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that a later-discovered physical injury caused by tobacco\nuse can be considered separate and distinct from an earlier-discovered physical injury, for\nstatute of limitations purposes, but expressly confined its holding to “latent disease cases,\nwithout deciding whether the same rule should apply in other contexts.” The court\ndistinguished latent disease like the plaintiff’s lung cancer from earlier-occurring disease\nlike the plaintiff’s COPD based on the showing—accepted as true given the procedural\nposture—“ ‘that COPD is a separate illness, which does not pre-dispose or lead to lung\ncancer and that it has nothing medically, biologically, or pathologically to do with lung\ncancer.’ ” (Id. at p. 802.) Given the separate and distinct nature of the later-occurring\ninjury, the court drew on its reasoning in an earlier decision which held that appreciable\nharm from tobacco addiction in the form of economic injury (i.e., cost of purchasing\ncigarettes) did not begin the running of the statute of limitations on a suit to recover\ndamages for physical injury (i.e., emphysema and periodontal disease) later resulting\nfrom that addiction. (Id. at p. 799, citing Grisham v. Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc. (2007) 40\nCal.4th 623, 643-646.)\n       Finally, in Hindin, supra, 118 Cal.App.4th at pages 1258 through 1259, the court\ndetermined that the trial court had improperly granted summary adjudication where the\naction for malicious prosecution asserted only a single cause of action, based on a single\nprimary right, even though the underlying lawsuit breached that primary right in two\nways. In contrast, the court in Edward Fineman Co. v. Superior Court (1998) 66\nCal.App.4th 1110, 1116-1118 (Fineman), determined that each of 23 unauthorized\nchecks paid by the defendant bank constituted a “separate and distinct alleged obligation\nor claim” (id. at p. 1118) for purposes of summary adjudication, even though the\nplaintiff’s complaint aggregated the 23 claims into a single cause of action.\n\n                                              34\n\f       As applied here, Hindin is inapposite, because this case is not a malicious\nprosecution action in which the underlying litigation involved different primary rights.\nFineman and E-Fab are distinguishable based on the nature of the claims at issue.\nWhereas in Fineman, the processing of each fraudulent check represented “a separate and\ndistinct wrongful act” that could be assessed independently as a separate cause of action\n(Fineman, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1118), the different manifestations of injury in this\ncase represent an ongoing series of consequences all traceable to the same underlying bad\nadvice. In E-Fab, the nature of the respective claims required the court “to segregate\n[the] plaintiff’s claims against its employee . . . from its claims against [the] defendant,\nrecognizing that each may accrue at a different time.” (E-Fab, supra, 153 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1322.) In contrast, because the series of injuries claimed in this case all trace to the\nsame underlying conduct committed by the same defendants, there is no basis to assign a\nlater accrual date once plaintiffs had “ ‘reason to suspect an injury and some wrongful\ncause . . . .’ ” (Id. at p. 1319; Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 803.) To the extent that the\nnarrow holding in Pooshs has any application here, we note that unlike a plaintiff who\ndevelops one disease but has no reason to suspect the future occurrence of a still-latent\ndisease (Pooshs, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 802), plaintiffs’ knowledge that the IRS would\nissue penalties under the section 412(i) Plan and had recommended unwinding the Plan\nor converting to a traditional 412 Plan provided ample reason to suspect and investigate\nother inevitable economic consequences.\n       In sum, our conclusion that the statute of limitations began to run on plaintiffs’\ncauses of action as of September 2007 extends to all claims arising from the allegations\nthat defendants improperly induced the Chois into establishing the 412(i) Plan and\nfunding it in a manner that was bound to trigger IRS scrutiny.

Plaintiffs also claim that defendants failed to take\nprompt action to mitigate damages when the IRS issued revenue rulings and regulations\nin 2004 and 2005 that called such 412(i) plans into question. Defendants\ncross-complained for indemnity and comparative fault against American General Life\nInsurance Company (American General), whose products funded plaintiffs’ 412(i) Plan.\n\f       At issue in this appeal are defendants’ and American General’s separate motions\nfor summary judgment, which the trial court granted after finding that plaintiffs’ claims\nwere time-barred. Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred by (1) determining that the\nlimitations period began to run as of September 2007, when plaintiffs were “on notice”\nthat the IRS would impose penalties in connection with the 412(i) Plan, rather than in\n2010 when penalties were assessed, (2) failing to consider any tolling effect created by\nthe ongoing fiduciary relationship between defendants and plaintiffs, and (3) applying the\nSeptember 2007 “notice” date as a bar to all causes of action in the complaint.\n       For the reasons stated herein, we affirm.\n                                  I.   BACKGROUND\n  A. PLAINTIFFS’ COMPLAINT\n       Husband and wife, Nelson Choi and Jeannie Choi (the Chois), and their\nclosely-held corporation Choice Instruments, Inc. (together “plaintiffs”) filed this action\nin November 2010 against their former financial advisors (individuals Matthew Roberson\nand Richard Brown, and Sagemark Consulting, Lincoln Financial Advisors, and Lincoln\nNational Corporation—together “defendants”), asserting causes of action for negligence,\nfraud and deceit, and breach of contract.\n       According to the complaint, the Chois consulted in 2003 with Roberson and\nBrown of Sagemark Consulting, who also were authorized agents of Lincoln Financial,\nfor assistance with investments, asset protection, and tax planning. Defendants advised\nthe Chois that an Internal Revenue Code section 412(i) Plan retirement account was ideal\nfor them and would provide tax advantages, asset protection, and steady income. It\nrequired a complex program of several steps. First, plaintiffs were to purchase large\namounts of “whole life” insurance and pay annual premiums on a five-year schedule.\nSecond, after five years the Chois would purchase the whole life policies from the 412(i)\nPlan at a low “ ‘cash surrender value,’ ” leaving cash in the 412(i) Plan account while the\nChois would own the whole life policies personally. This allegedly would create a\n\n                                             2\n\f“ ‘springing’ ” or increasing cash value for plaintiffs. The third step was a “ ‘power\nplay’ ” exchange of the whole life policies for certain American General Universal Life\n“ ‘Platinum Provider’ ” policies, which would allow plaintiffs to take advantage of\ngenerous borrowing provisions and tax-free cash flow based on the increased policy\nvalues.\n       Per defendants’ recommendation, Choice Instruments bought the Chois individual\nAmerican General whole life policies in 2003, which required annual premium payments\non a five-year schedule through 2007, for a total purchase price of $1,275,000.\nDefendants urged the Chois to buy similar policies in 2004, requiring premium payments\nover five years through 2008, for a total purchase price of $439,000. The policies\ncomprised 70 to 75 percent of the 412(i) Plan portfolio. Defendants allegedly touted the\n“certainty of the immediate deductibility of such contributions” to the 412(i) Plan\naccount, which they “assured . . . was appropriate and authorized by applicable tax law.”\nThey allegedly assured plaintiffs that the program was “ ‘bullet proof,’ ” time-tested, and\ncarried no substantial risk of adverse IRS action or tax consequences.\n       The IRS audit began in 2006. Plaintiffs alleged damages beginning in 2008, when\ncontrary to the previously-represented “ ‘exit strategy’ ” of purchasing the whole life\npolicies at the low cash surrender value, defendants advised them that the IRS would\nrequire fair market value. Plaintiffs paid a total of $613,000 for the purchase of the four\npolicies (approximately $300,000 1 over the anticipated cost). Defendants advised\nplaintiffs to convert the 412(i) Plan to a traditional Internal Revenue Code section 412\nPlan (the “412 Plan”) because the IRS had adopted a negative view of the policies under\nthe 412(i) Plan and considered them defective and not IRS-approved. Defendants\nasserted that this was the fault of American General.\n\n       1\n        Plaintiffs alleged a difference of approximately $212,000 for the 2003 policies\nand approximately $77,000 to $82,000 for the 2004 policies.\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       Plaintiffs alleged additional damages in 2008 and 2009 from the purchase of\nwhole life policies through Penn Mutual, which they claimed defendants falsely advised\nwas necessary to comply with the requirements of the converted 412 Plan and resulted in\nan “immediate loss” in cash value of approximately $470,000. Plaintiffs further alleged\nthat in 2009, after the IRS audit ended, they were required to pay in excess of $440,000 in\nback taxes and interest for disallowed deductions under the 412(i) Plan, plus $60,000 in\nadditional penalties, and faced future estimated payments of $100,000 to the Franchise\nTax Board of California and anticipated IRS penalties of $600,000 for not reporting the\ntransactions on form 8886.\n       Plaintiffs in sum alleged that defendants “misrepresented, concealed and failed to\ndisclose” the risk that: (1) the “great weighting of life insurance policies” in excess of 50\npercent of plan assets would render the 412(i) Plan “suspect and defective in the view of\nthe IRS”; (2) the IRS would disallow the deductibility of contributions into the 412(i)\nPlan account for the life insurance purchases; (3) the “ ‘springing’ ” cash values would be\nsuspect and unlikely to be approved by the IRS, so plaintiffs would be forced to pay far\nmore (fair market value) than the low cash surrender value; (4) the “irrevocable right” to\n“power play” exchange the whole life policies for the superior “ ‘Platinum Provider’ ”\npolicies was not guaranteed, because American General had a reservation of rights to\nchange or withdraw policies; and (5) the policy purchases were most likely “reportable\ntransactions to be listed on Form 8886” and could be considered abusive tax shelters.\nThey alleged that they would have been better served by purchasing all or mostly\nannuities in a 412(i) Plan, or by “conventional investments,” and that defendants’\nrepresentations that the 412(i) Plan was time-tested and carried little risk of disallowance\nwere false.\n  B. DEFENDANTS’ ANSWER AND CROSS-COMPLAINT\n       Defendants answered the complaint, pleading as an affirmative defense the bar of\n“the applicable statute of limitations, including but not limited to California Code of Civil\n\n                                              4\n\fProcedure section 338.” Defendants also cross-complained against American General for\nindemnity and comparative fault. Defendants assert on appeal that the cross-complaint\nwas “wholly derivative” of plaintiffs’ complaint, so if they were found not liable to\nplaintiffs, American General would not be liable to them. 2\n  C. SUMMARY JUDGMENT PROCEEDINGS\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c) 3 in October\n2013, and plaintiffs filed opposition in May 2014, following stipulated time extensions.\n       Defendants argued that plaintiffs could not prevail as a matter of law as to each\ncause of action, that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations,\nand that the corporate defendants were not proper parties to the action. In support of the\nstatute of limitations defense, defendants requested judicial notice of the filing date of\nplaintiffs’ complaint (November 12, 2010) and of an IRS revenue ruling from March\n2004. We summarize the evidence and arguments pertaining only to the statute of\nlimitations issue.\n       Based on the November 2010 filing date of plaintiffs’ complaint, defendants\nargued that plaintiffs were time-barred from asserting a negligence or breach of implied\ncontract claim that accrued prior to November 2008, or a fraud claim that accrued prior to\nNovember 2007 (based on the applicable statutes of limitations for negligence (former\n§ 339.1), breach of contract (§ 339), and fraud (§ 338, subd. (d)). Defendants offered two\ncommunications to show that plaintiffs were informed as of November 2006 that the IRS\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         The record on appeal does not contain a copy of the cross-complaint against\nAmerican General. We rely on defendants’ statement that the cross-complaint was\n“wholly derivative” of plaintiffs’ complaint only insofar as it appears to be consistent\nwith the trial court’s ruling on the motion for summary judgment, which addressed both\ndefendants’ and American General’s motions for summary judgment.\n       3\n         Unspecified statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fhad identified defects in the 412(i) Plan, and as of September 2007 that there would be\nIRS penalties and damages accruing.\n       First, in a letter dated November 28, 2006, from the IRS to Choice Instruments,\nthe IRS listed defects of the 412(i) Plan and recommended that plaintiffs unwind the plan\nand distribute the policies, or convert to a section 412 Plan.\n       Second, in an e-mail dated September 19, 2007, from Brown to the Chois, Brown\nsaid that “Dennis” 4 was “close to settling 28 out of 32 of his cases with the IRS” and\n“[a]lthough there will be penalties, some or all of it will be recaptured in your 2007\ndeduction.” Brown explained that Dennis “believes that American General will come\nforward with some kind of favorable offer that will offset some of the penalty as well,”\nand although he could not provide “exact numbers,” “some kind of resolution” seemed to\nbe close, at which point they would need “to talk about getting the policies out of the plan\nper the original strategy.” Mr. Choi expressed some relief in response, stating that he\nhoped “settlement is neared, and we don’t have to pay any penalties that will be our\nultimate goal.” Brown then responded, “Dennis said you probably will have to pay\npenalties—i.e. write a check to the IRS, but it will be made up in a subsequent deduction\nfor 2007 and some enhancements to the insurance products if American General steps up\nto the plate.” In the continued e-mail exchange, Mr. Choi stated that he was “expecting\nAG [American General] to step up to the plate to take care [of] the penalties. As you are\naware, they sold this bad product to us without any legitimacy approval from the IRS,\nand have clients claimed all the tax deductions. That’s really got us upset.” Brown\nresponded, “Dennis seemed very confident that American General will do the right thing,\n       4\n        Defendants Brown and Roberson apparently referred plaintiffs to third parties\nDennis Cunning and Pension Professionals of America to administer the 412(i) Plan and\nhelp respond to the IRS audit. Several documents that plaintiffs cite in support of their\narguments on appeal, including those that were not timely submitted in opposition to the\nmotion for summary judgment (see Discussion section II.C.1., post), include\ncommunications with Dennis Cunning.\n\n\n                                              6\n\fbut I don’t want to be overly optimistic at this point. As you know, it’s all hot air until\nit’s in writing.”\n       According to defendants, the Chois’ knowledge of indeterminate damages due to\nthe 412(i) Plan as of September 2007 was sufficient, under the relevant case law, to\ntrigger the statute of limitations on all of plaintiffs’ claims.\n       Plaintiffs opposed the motion for summary judgment on each of the asserted\ngrounds, including the statute of limitations defense, and purported to dispute most of\ndefendants’ 32 material facts by citing their “Statement of Facts and Opposing Evidence\nBelow Applicable to Motion Generally Nos. 33-105.” They asserted that the November\n2006 letter from the IRS merely informed them that the 412(i) Plan would be audited, and\nthat a threat or possibility of damages is insufficient to complete the cause of action and\ntrigger the statute of limitations. Rather, they contended that damages did not begin to\naccrue until at least 2009, when the audit and negotiations with the IRS concluded, and\nback taxes and penalties began to be assessed. For factual support, plaintiffs referenced\ntheir proffered, material facts Nos. 33-105 (comprising three volumes of evidence\ntotaling about 1,000 pages).\n       The trial court issued a tentative ruling to grant defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment on the statute of limitations defense. The court found that undisputed evidence\nshowed plaintiffs “were on notice of the IRS penalties imposed on them no later than\nSeptember 2007.” Specifically, plaintiffs “were aware that the IRS would be seeking\npenalties and . . . were looking to others to cover those penalties.” The court rejected\nplaintiffs’ argument that damages did not accrue until completion of the audit in 2009.\nCiting the two-year and three-year statutes of limitations applicable to plaintiffs’ causes\nof action, the court concluded that the action, filed in November 2010, was time-barred.\n       The trial court indicated that it also would grant American General’s motion for\nsummary judgment on the cross-complaint, since there was “no basis for liability against\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fdefendants in the complaint, there [were] no triable issues of fact with respect to”\ndefendants’ claims for indemnity, contribution, and comparative fault.\n       Plaintiffs contested the tentative ruling. At the hearing, plaintiffs filed a notice of\nerrata and requested leave to file a motion to amend their separate statement in opposition\nto defendants’ summary judgment motion. The notice of errata sought to correct the\ninadvertent omission of two deposition exhibits from plaintiffs’ evidence filed in support\nof their opposition. Plaintiffs’ counsel explained that the omitted exhibits were a “key\npiece of evidence” showing that defendants, in their capacity as financial advisors, had\nadvised plaintiffs to be patient and not file lawsuits because defendants’ attorneys were\noptimistic about the audit and defendants were going to cover some lawyers’ fees as well.\nHe argued that plaintiffs should be allowed to submit additional evidence of\ncommunications between the Chois and defendants regarding the IRS audit and\nnegotiations, to contravene defendants’ assertion that the Chois were aware of damages\nin September 2007.\n       Regarding the statute of limitations defense, plaintiffs pointed out that the\nSeptember 2007 e-mail did not confirm they would suffer damages, because Brown\nexpressed hope that some or all penalties could be recaptured in 2007 deductions or\ncovered by American General. More broadly, they argued that the limitations defense\nrelated only to the damages arising from tax penalties and the audit, whereas plaintiffs’\nclaims encompassed other damages that accrued later. Plaintiffs objected that\ndefendants’ “very narrow motion should not dismiss everything else that’s in the\ncomplaint.”\n       The trial court rejected plaintiffs’ attempt to introduce evidence and legal theories\nthat were not included in the written opposition and explained that it would adopt its\ntentative ruling. The court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants\nand American General reflected the same reasoning set forth in the tentative, based on the\nconclusion that plaintiffs’ action was time-barred. The court thus declined to address\n\n                                              8\n\fdefendants’ objections to evidence or the other grounds raised in support of the summary\njudgment motion. The court entered judgment for defendants and against plaintiffs on\nAugust 21, 2014. The court simultaneously entered judgment for American General and\nagainst defendants as cross-complainants. Plaintiffs timely appealed the judgment\nagainst them on October 16, 2014. Defendants, as cross-complainants, appealed the\njudgment on that same day.\n                                   II.   DISCUSSION\n\n  A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       Summary judgment is appropriate when there are no triable issues of material fact\nsuch that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all causes of\naction. (§ 437c; Schachter v. Citigroup, Inc. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2597301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2597301/schachter-v-citigroup-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (Schachter).)\n       We review an order granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same\nthree-step analysis as the trial court. (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">826</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860; Pipitone v. Williams (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1437</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1449 (Pipitone).) First, we\nidentify the causes of action framed by the pleadings. Second, we determine whether the\nmoving party has satisfied its burden of showing the causes of action have no merit\nbecause one or more elements cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense\nto that cause of action. Third, if the moving party has made a prima facie showing that it\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the burden of production shifts and we review\nwhether the party opposing summary judgment has provided evidence of a triable issue\nof material fact as to the cause of action or a defense. (§ 437c, subds. (o), (p)(2);\nPipitone, supra, at p. 1449.) A party opposing summary judgment may not “rely upon\nthe mere allegations or denials of its pleadings” but must set forth “specific facts” beyond\nthe pleadings to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact. (§ 437c,\nsubd. (p)(2).) The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\nparty. (Schachter, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 618.)\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f  B. GROUNDS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n       The trial court granted summary judgment based solely on the statute of\nlimitations. Plaintiffs contend that the court erred, both as to its determination of when\nthe statute of limitations began to run on plaintiffs’ claims and as to which claims were\naffected. Defendants dispute plaintiffs’ interpretation of when a cause of action accrues\nand argue that plaintiffs improperly rely on evidence and arguments that were not before\nthe trial court. 5 Defendants further contend that the summary judgment was proper in\nany event, based on grounds raised in the motion that the trial court declined to address,\nand given plaintiffs’ procedurally defective opposition. Plaintiffs respond that it would\nbe error for this court to decide issues not considered by the trial court, including\ndefendants’ alternate grounds for summary judgment and the sufficiency of plaintiffs’\nresponsive separate statement of material facts.\n       Because we will affirm the grant of summary judgment based solely on the statute\nof limitations, we need not address any alternate grounds argued in defendants’ motion. 6\nWe note, however, that whether plaintiffs’ responsive separate statement of material facts\nconformed to applicable rules is not beyond our immediate review. It is implicit in the\ntrial court’s finding that defendants “provided undisputed evidence” of the material facts\n\n       5\n          We requested supplemental briefing on whether two legal theories raised in\nplaintiffs’ opening brief had been forfeited and have considered the parties’ responses in\nour analysis.\n        6\n          If this court were to reach any of the grounds not relied upon by the trial court,\nsection 437c, subdivision (m)(2) requires only that we “afford the parties an opportunity\nto present their views on the issue by submitting supplemental briefs.” It does not mean\nthis court cannot decide issues that were briefed for the trial court and addressed by both\nsides on appeal.

It is not the\ncourt’s duty to rummage through the papers to construct or resuscitate their case”].)\n  C. ANALYSIS\n       The crux of plaintiffs’ claim on appeal is that the trial court erred in finding that\nthe September 2007 e-mail exchange between Brown and the Chois apprised the Chois of\ndamages based on IRS penalties. Plaintiffs argue that the e-mail exchange, at most, put\nthe Chois on notice that damages might occur in the future, depending on factors\nincluding the pending IRS audit, the offset of penalties with 2007 tax deductions, and the\npossibility that American General might cover certain costs. Plaintiffs argue that the\ncourt’s finding that plaintiffs were “on notice” of damages contravenes the principle that\nthe possibility of future damages does not commence running of the statute of limitations.\n       Plaintiffs further argue that even if the September 2007 e-mail exchange\nconstituted notice of damages, the court erred in failing to consider whether the fiduciary\nrelationship between the Chois and defendants as their investment advisors tolled the\nstatute of limitations or lessened plaintiffs’ burden to discover the wrongful conduct. In\nsupport of this argument—and for added context around the Chois’ understanding of the\n\n                                              11\n\fSeptember 2007 e-mail—plaintiffs rely on late-filed evidentiary submissions that the trial\ncourt rejected. Plaintiffs also contend that the trial court erred in failing to determine\nwhether knowledge of IRS penalties as of September 2007 triggered the statute of\nlimitations as to each independent cause of action alleged in the complaint.\n       We first address plaintiffs’ efforts to supplement the evidence and invoke legal\ntheories that were not included in their written opposition to the motion for summary\njudgment. We then consider plaintiffs’ statute of limitations arguments.\n\n            1. The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion in Refusing to Consider\n               Plaintiffs’ Tardy Submissions\n       On the day of the summary judgment hearing, plaintiffs sought to supplement the\nrecord with evidence to bolster their arguments opposing the statute of limitations\ndefense. In a notice of errata, plaintiffs’ counsel declared that two deposition exhibits\nhad been inadvertently omitted. Counsel explained that the exhibits were not new\nevidence, because defendants had attended the deposition using those exhibits and had\nnotice of their content based on plaintiffs’ responsive separate statement.\n       Plaintiffs also requested leave to file a motion to amend their separate statement.\nThey maintained that if the trial court was inclined to grant summary judgment on the\nstatute of limitations issue, “[i]t would be gravely prejudicial to Plaintiffs to not consider\nevidence that highlights Defendants’ continuing legal advice to Plaintiffs, as well as\ninstructions not to pursue litigation. Plaintiffs’ reliance on the advice of Defendants and\nDefendants’ counsel to forbear litigation against Defendants tolls the statute of\nlimitations.”\n       The trial court refused both requests and rejected plaintiffs’ legal arguments that\nrelied on the late-filed evidence. The court observed that a “very substantial part of the\nargument presented this morning is based on a legal theory that’s nowhere in the\nopposition. Defendants haven’t heard it before. They haven’t had a chance to think\nabout it, to reflect on the facts on which the plaintiffs are relying, many of which were\n\n\n                                              12\n\fnot in the record until today, and the legal authorities that the plaintiffs are presenting\nnow for the first time. [¶] So that is not appropriate.” Plaintiffs filed objections to the\ndenial of leave to amend and attached the excluded evidence, arguing that the additional\nevidence “would have further bolstered Plaintiffs’ contention that a triable issue of fact\nexisted in light of the Court’s tentative ruling.”\n       On appeal, plaintiffs rely in part on several of the late-filed exhibits and argue that\nthe trial court “had discretion to and should have considered these additional documents.”\nThey suggest that since the statute of limitations argument “constituted a very small part”\nof the motion for summary judgment—comprising only one of five issues to be\nadjudicated—“it was not unreasonable” for plaintiffs to seek leave to introduce additional\nevidence bearing on that defense, given the trial court’s tentative ruling. Yet plaintiffs\ncite no legal authority to support the contention that the court erred in refusing to\nconsider the evidence and related arguments.\n       The exhibits appended to plaintiffs’ notice of errata and motion to amend the\nresponsive separate statement—filed on the day of the hearing—were untimely. A party\nmust file and serve opposition to a motion for summary judgment “not less than 14 days”\nprior to the scheduled hearing, “unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.”\n(§ 437c, subd. (b)(2).) Defendants point out that due to time extensions, plaintiffs had\n“approximately 221 days” to oppose the motion for summary judgment, far more than the\nprescribed period to file opposition under the statute. (Id., subds. (a)(2), (b)(2).) When\npressed by the trial court to explain the tardy submissions, plaintiffs’ counsel stated that\n“key” evidence in the notice of errata was omitted due to clerical error, and the evidence\nand arguments in the motion for leave to amend were “not in the brief” but were\ndiscussed “in a broad context as far as the allegations.” He explained, “We’re putting it\nbefore the Court today. . . . We didn’t realize the Court would grasp on to [the statute of\nlimitations issue].”\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       On this showing, we are not persuaded that the trial court erred. “Good cause\nmust be shown to the satisfaction of the trial court before supplemental material may be\nfiled after the statutory deadline . . . .” (Hobson v. Raychem Corp. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Furthermore, “case law has been strict in requiring good cause\nto be shown before late filed papers will be accepted.” (Hobson v. Raychem Corp.,\nsupra, at p. 625 [citing example in which counsel for the party opposing summary\njudgment was retained only one day before the hearing].) The trial court considered and\nrejected plaintiffs’ requests to submit additional evidence, noting the failure to comply\nwith statutory requirements and the unfairness to defendants. This was a proper exercise\nof the court’s discretion. Accordingly, we reject plaintiffs’ references to any of the\nlate-filed evidence in support of their arguments on appeal.\n\n            2. The Statute of Limitations Period on Plaintiffs’ Claims Commenced\n               Upon Inquiry Notice of Wrongful Conduct Causing Damages\n       The thrust of plaintiffs’ complaint is that defendants wrongly advised the Chois to\nestablish the section 412(i) Plan despite known risks and increasing IRS scrutiny, causing\nplaintiffs to suffer financial losses, back taxes, and government penalties. Plaintiffs’\nclaims sound in tort and are subject to a two- or three-year statute of limitations. 7 If the\n\n       7\n          Plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in considering any statute of\nlimitations other than section 338, which defendants expressly cited in their answer.\nPlaintiffs are correct that a defendant who pleads the statute of limitations by reference to\nthe statute must specify the section and, if applicable, particular subdivision(s).

In ascertaining suspicion or knowledge of the elements of a\ncause of action, courts “do not take a hypertechnical approach . . . . Rather than\nexamining whether the plaintiffs suspect facts supporting each specific legal element of a\nparticular cause of action, we look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect\nthat a type of wrongdoing has injured them.” (Ibid.)\n       “The resolution of a statute of limitations defense is typically a factual question for\nthe trier of fact. However, summary judgment is proper if the court can draw only one\nlegitimate inference from uncontradicted evidence about the limitations issue.” (SFUSD,\nsupra, 37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1325-1326; Adams, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 586 [determining\nwhen plaintiff suffered “manifest and palpable injury” generally raises a question of fact,\nbut may be resolved as a matter of law if the material facts are undisputed].)\n       As previously noted, defendants relied on two exhibits for their statute of\nlimitations defense: (1) the November 2006 letter from the IRS to Choice Instruments\ninforming plaintiffs of specific defects in the 412(i) Plan and recommending that\nplaintiffs “unwind the plan and distribute the policies” or treat the Plan as subject to\nInternal Revenue Code section 412, and (2) the September 2007 e-mail between Brown\nand plaintiffs informing them that “there will be penalties . . . .” The parties primarily\ndispute the effect of the September 2007 e-mail.\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f       Plaintiffs acknowledge that in the e-mail, Brown notified the Chois that the IRS\nintended to impose penalties on them. But they argue that when read in its entirety, the\ne-mail communicated Brown’s expectation that some or all penalties would be recaptured\nin the Chois’ 2007 deduction, and American General would offer to improve the\ninsurance products in order to avoid financial loss to the Chois. Plaintiffs argue that Mr.\nChoi’s response reflected these assurances, and the fact that penalties had not been\nassessed shows that damages remained uncertain, as did any indication that defendants\nhad acted wrongfully. Plaintiffs posit that the September 2007 e-mail presented, at best,\na triable issue of material fact regarding whether the Chois were “on notice” of actual and\npresent damages, given speculation about the outcome of the IRS audit. Defendants\nrespond that while the amount of damages was unknown, the September 2007 e-mail\nprovides undisputed evidence that plaintiffs were aware of the existence of damages,\nwhich under well-established case authority completes the cause of action and triggers\nthe limitations period.\n       Our resolution of this question turns on what constitutes notice of “ ‘appreciable\nand actual harm’ ” (SFUSD, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 1326) in the financial or\ninvestment advising context when the ultimate, financial outcome remains indeterminate\neven while the imposition of penalties appears certain. Viewing the September 2007\ne-mail exchange in the light most favorable to plaintiffs (Schachter, supra, 47 Cal.4th at\np. 618), we nevertheless conclude that plaintiffs had “reason to at least suspect” that\ndefendants’ advice to establish the 412(i) Plan, weighted toward life insurance and\ndependent on deductions and features like “springing” cash values, had harmed them.\n(Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 807.) Our conclusion traces the case law addressing when\nthe injury element of a tort cause of action is complete, causing the cause of action to\naccrue and the limitations period to commence.\n       We begin with International Engine Parts, Inc. v.

The\ncourt explained that based on IRS procedures for the examination of tax returns and\nassessment of deficiencies, findings prior to the penalty assessment “are merely proposed\nfindings, subject to review and negotiation.” (Id. at p. 609.) While noting that other\n“palpable harm caused by the malpractice of the accountant” might accrue prior to\nfinalization of the audit, the court reasoned that such harm would be “based on a tentative\nassessment of potential liability only” and thus would not constitute “actual harm until\nthe date of the deficiency tax assessment or finality of the audit process.” (Id. at p. 620.)\n       Plaintiffs argue that because the September 2007 e-mail informed the Chois that\nthe IRS audit was ongoing and the amount of penalties and any potential offset were\nunknown, the reasoning of Feddersen should apply here. Plaintiffs maintain that there is\nno principled basis to distinguish between applying the statute of limitations in the\ncontext of IRS audit proceedings caused by negligent tax preparation and identical\nproceedings caused by faulty investment advice. Similar attempts to apply Feddersen in\nnon-tax preparation cases, however, have been rejected by subsequent case authority.\n       For example, in Sahadi v.

Apple Valley involved an accounting malpractice action in which the plaintiff\nschool district claimed that misrepresentations in the defendant accountants’ audit report\nhad induced it to improperly provide state funds to a charter school. (Id. at p. 937.)\n\n       8\n         In fact, Jordache expressly overruled an earlier Supreme Court decision—also\ninvolving legal malpractice—that Feddersen relied on by analogy in identifying when a\nclient suffers “actual injury” in the context of an accountant’s negligent preparation of\nincome tax returns. (Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at pp. 762-763 [explaining that the\n“broad, categorical rule” for accrual of an attorney malpractice cause of action articulated\nin ITT Small Business Finance Corp. v.

In Feddersen, the court examined the\nevolution of the “discovery plus actual injury” (Feddersen, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 615)\nrequirement in professional malpractice actions and relied in substantial part on ITT,\nexplaining that “the assessment of the tax deficiency is the equivalent of the settlement\n[of underlying litigation] in ITT, because the question whether the taxpayer suffered\nactual injury as a result of the accountant’s allegedly negligent preparation of the tax\nreturns is contingent on the outcome of the audit.” (Id. at p. 619.) Despite Feddersen’s\nreliance in part on ITT, the court in Jordache refrained from directly questioning\nFeddersen’s holding. (See Jordache, supra, at p. 764, fn. 10 [because Feddersen arose\nunder a different limitations provision and was not directed at legal malpractice actions,\n“we have no occasion in this case to reexamine Feddersen’s rationale or rule”].)\n\n\n                                             19\n\fThe trial court granted the defendants’ demurrer based on the statute of limitations,\nfinding that the school district became aware of the illegal charter school and suffered\nactual injury when it hired an accountant and attorney at or about that time. (Id. at\npp. 941-942.) On appeal, the school district contended in part that it did not suffer actual\ninjury until over two years later, when the state controller issued a report holding it\nresponsible for overpayments to the charter school; it urged that any liability for\noverpayments before that time “was merely speculative and could not constitute actual\ninjury.” (Id. at p. 944.)\n       After a detailed review of California Supreme Court and appellate court\njurisprudence on when professional negligence causes actual injury, the court elected not\nto extend the Feddersen rule to the accountants’ alleged, negligent misrepresentation.\n(Apple Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at pp. 944-947.) Rather, the court reasoned that the\nfact-specific inquiry articulated in Jordache for the timing of injury in a legal malpractice\naction “should apply except to cases which fall within Feddersen’s narrow holding\ngoverning negligent tax return preparation.” (Id. at p. 952.) Applying the Jordache\nanalysis of actual injury based on “whether the plaintiff has sustained damages\ncompensable in a malpractice action” (id. at p. 948), the court affirmed the trial court’s\nfinding that the district “suffered actual injury when it recognized the allegedly improper\napportionment payments to [the charter school] and incurred expenses in an attempt to\ndetermine the extent of the improper conduct.” (Id. at p. 953.)\n       In Van Dyke v. Dunker & Aced (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448 (Van Dyke)—an\naccountant malpractice action based on erroneous income tax advice—the court similarly\nconcluded that Feddersen’s bright-line rule for cases based on negligent preparation of\ntax returns “does not apply here.” The plaintiffs in Van Dyke allegedly relied on the\ndefendant accountant’s advice that donating a parcel of property to charity would offset\ntheir tax liability via a “ ‘dollar-for-dollar’ tax credit for the fair market value of the land\ndonated.” (Id. at p. 449.) The accountant later informed them that he had made a\n\n                                               20\n\fmistake about the tax credit and instead the plaintiffs would only get a tax deduction\nspread out over several years. (Ibid.) The plaintiffs paid taxes based on the deduction\nbut filed suit only a few years later, after another accountant reviewed the returns,\ndiscovered errors resulting in overpayment, and negotiated with the IRS for a partial\nrefund. (Id. at p. 450.) The trial court granted summary judgment for the defendants,\nfinding that the statute of limitations began to run when the accountant informed the\nplaintiffs of his mistake and their resulting tax liability. (Id. at pp. 450, 452.)\n       On appeal, the Van Dyke plaintiffs argued that their cause of action did not accrue\nuntil the completion of negotiations, when the IRS “finally determined” their tax\nobligations. (Van Dyke, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 452.) In declining to apply\nFeddersen, the court explained: “The propriety of the tax advice [the plaintiffs]\nreceived . . . was not contingent on the outcome of the IRS audit. There was nothing\nspeculative about the damages they suffered in 1991 as a result of the alleged erroneous\nadvice regarding the benefits of donating their property to a charitable organization. The\ndetermination by the IRS in 1994 regarding [the plaintiffs]’ 1990 tax liability merely\nresolved the extent of their loss.” (Id. at p. 455.) Comparing the injury in Van Dyke to\nthe immediate “ ‘loss of a right, remedy, or interest, or in the imposition of a liability’ ”\nin cases where the plaintiff entered into an unfavorable agreement due to poor legal\nadvice, the court explained that “ ‘there has been actual injury regardless of whether\nfuture events may affect the permanency of the injury or the amount of monetary\ndamages eventually incurred.’ ” (Id. at p. 457.)\n       Plaintiffs offer no persuasive justification to depart from Apple Valley, Van Dyke,\nand the Supreme Court’s own authority, including Adams and Jordache—all cases that\nrejected proposals to extend Feddersen’s bright-line rule for determining “actual injury”\nto claims based on conduct other than the negligent preparation of tax returns. Moreover,\nplaintiffs’ argument that commencement of the statute of limitations in the context of IRS\naudit proceedings related to faulty investment advice need not differ from the context of\n\n                                               21\n\faudit proceedings related to negligent tax preparation obscures a key difference: whether\nactual injury is contingent on the outcome of the IRS audit process. It may be that actual\ninjury results from an accountant’s allegedly negligent preparation of tax returns only as\ndetermined by an IRS audit (Feddersen, supra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 619), but the same cannot\nbe said for more wide-ranging categories of negligent tax-related or investment advice.\n(See, e.g., Van Dyke, supra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 455 [propriety of tax advice and\nresulting injury not contingent on outcome of IRS audit].)\n       Because Feddersen’s bright-line rule does not dictate when the statute of\nlimitations began to run on plaintiffs’ causes of action in this case, our determination is\ngoverned by the general rules articulated in Jordache and later in Fox, and applied in\nApple Valley and Van Dyke. Plaintiffs do not seriously dispute that they had reason to\nsuspect negligent conduct causing loss or damage as of the September 2007 e-mail\nexchange, but contend that the damage had not manifested and any anticipated damages\nwere too uncertain and speculative to constitute actual injury. (See Apple Valley, supra,\n98 Cal.App.4th at p. 942 [statute of limitations “begins to run when (1) the aggrieved\nparty discovers the negligent conduct causing the loss or damage and (2) the aggrieved\nparty has suffered actual injury as a result of the negligent conduct”].)\n       Certainly, as of the September 2007 e-mail, plaintiffs “discover[ed] or should have\ndiscovered” (Atlantic Richfield, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 317) that defendants’ advice\nhad led them to trouble. The November 2006 notice from the IRS informed them of\nsignificant “defects” 9 in the 412(i) Plan that defendants had advised them to establish and\n\n       9\n         The listed defects identified those characteristics of the Plan that plaintiffs allege\ndefendants represented would bring them substantial financial value and were “ ‘bullet\nproof.’ ” The IRS identified the defects as “1. Listed Transaction under Revenue Ruling\n2004-20 [¶] 2. Springing Cash Values [¶] 3. Exchange Rights for a policy with higher\nvalue [¶] 4. Values provided by the contracts significantly exceed amounts needed for\nbenefits under the Plan (including IRC 415) [¶] 5. Excessive surrender/expense charges\n[¶] 6. No separate agreement for flexible premium deferred annuity contracts [¶]\n(continued)\n\n                                              22\n\frecommended that they “unwind the plan and distribute the policies” or treat it as a 412\nPlan. The September 2007 e-mail informed the Chois that there would be IRS penalties\nbut reflected cautious optimism that the penalties would be offset in other ways,\nincluding a deduction and “some kind of favorable offer” if American General “steps up\nto the plate.” Mr. Choi responded, “I am expecting [American General] to step up to the\nplate to take care [of] the penalties. As you are aware, they sold this bad product to us\nwithout any legitimacy approval from the IRS, and have clients claimed all the tax\ndeductions. That’s really got us upset.”\n       Contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion that “there was no certainty” that the Chois “knew\nof Defendants’ wrongful acts,” this exchange satisfies the requirement under the\ndiscovery rule that “[a] plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she\n‘has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.’ ” (Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th\nat p. 807.) Based on Mr. Choi’s response to Brown, plaintiffs recognized that the policies\nthey bought under the 412(i) Plan were compromised and would require payment of\npenalties—though they hoped and insisted that they would not have to pay. Given that\nthe defects in the 412(i) Plan identified by the IRS directly matched those elements of the\nPlan that were supposed to generate a high cash value, confirmation the following year\nthat the IRS would impose penalties was more than adequate to trigger suspicion not only\nregarding the impending penalties, but regarding the promised benefits of the 412(i) Plan.\n       Generally, once plaintiffs “have reason to at least suspect that a type of\nwrongdoing has injured them,” the cause of action begins to accrue. (Fox, supra, 35\nCal.4th at p. 807.) The plaintiffs at that point “are required to conduct a reasonable\ninvestigation . . . , and are charged with knowledge of the information that would have\nbeen revealed by such an investigation.” (Id. at p. 808.) There is no indication that the\n\n\n7. Non-level premiums [¶] 8. Benefits provided by the contracts are not equal to the\nbenefit provided by the plan under one or more forms.”\n\n\n                                             23\n\fduty to investigate applies differently when the element in question is that of damages, or\nmore specifically, the extent thereof. It is often repeated that “the limitations period\nbegins once the plaintiff ‘ “ ‘has notice or information of circumstances to put a\nreasonable person on inquiry . . . .’ ” ’ [Citations.] A plaintiff need not be aware of the\nspecific ‘facts’ necessary to establish the claim; that is a process contemplated by pretrial\ndiscovery. Once the plaintiff has a suspicion of wrongdoing, and therefore an incentive\nto sue, she must decide whether to file suit or sit on her rights. So long as a suspicion\nexists, it is clear that the plaintiff must go find the facts; she cannot wait for the facts to\nfind her.” (Jolly v. Eli Lilly & Co. (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1377307\"><a href=\"/opinion/1377307/jolly-v-eli-lilly-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1110-1111 (Jolly).)\n       Here, plaintiffs were aware of facts that should have put them on inquiry notice of\nthe cause or causes of action arising from defendants’ investment advice. (Jolly, supra,\n44 Cal.3d at pp. 1110-1111; Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 807.) Specifically as to\n“ ‘appreciable and actual harm’ ” (Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 748) or the “ ‘actual\ninjury’ ” (ibid.) element of the tort cause of action, “the fact of damage, not the amount”\nserves as the relevant metric. (Id. at p. 743; Adams, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 589.) As\ndefined in Jordache, “[a]ctual injury refers only to the legally cognizable damage\nnecessary to assert the cause of action.” (Jordache, supra, at p. 752.)\n       The IRS’s notice to plaintiffs in November 2006 of numerous defects in their\n412(i) Plan and the need to unwind or otherwise alter the Plan structure raised suspicion\nabout plaintiffs’ ability to realize the promised value of their insurance investments. The\nSeptember 2007 e-mail certainly indicated “legally cognizable damage” (Jordache,\nsupra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 752) in the form of IRS penalties, which appeared certain even\nwhile the ultimate financial impact was unknown. This went beyond “speculative and\ncontingent injuries,” which “are those that do not yet exist, as when an attorney’s error\ncreates only a potential for harm in the future.” (Id. at p. 754.) Brown’s inability to\nprovide “exact numbers” and hedging on whether the penalties would be “recaptured” in\na deduction or potentially “offset” by American General did not consign the fact of\n\n                                               24\n\fdamages to that of potential future harm not yet realized. Rather, the evidence shows that\nthe propriety of defendants’ advice regarding the 412(i) Plan, and the fact of damages,\nwere ascertainable, even if “future events” might have affected the permanency of the\ninjury “or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.” (Ibid.)\n       We recognize that defendants did not show that plaintiffs had incurred calculable\ndamages as of September 2007. On that basis, plaintiffs contrast their circumstances\nupon learning of impending IRS penalties with the “actual injury” in Van Dyke, which as\nnoted earlier, accrued when the plaintiffs transferred their property based on the\naccountant’s faulty advice and were assessed higher taxes than expected. (Van Dyke,\nsupra, 46 Cal.App.4th at p. 455.) Plaintiffs argue that Van Dyke supports a finding of no\nactual injury here, because no penalty assessment or tax had yet occurred. The facts in\nApple Valley could support a similar argument, insofar as the school district had already\npaid state apportionment funds to the charter school and later incurred out-of-pocket\nlosses by paying investigation and legal fees. (Apple Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 946-947.)\n       However, by the time plaintiffs learned that the IRS’s adverse assessment of the\n412(i) Plan would result in penalties, neither the lack of a numeric assessment nor the\nhope of offset by another source negated the fact that plaintiffs were on notice of actual\ninjury. Not only had plaintiffs already invested substantial money into the program, but\nBrown told them they would have to pay IRS penalties, and the IRS had notified them\nthat the 412(i) Plan components promising springing cash value and exchange rights for a\nhigher-value policy were defective. As the Supreme Court reiterated in Jordache,\n“ ‘[t]he mere breach of a professional duty, causing only nominal damages, speculative\nharm, or the threat of future harm—not yet realized—does not suffice to create a cause of\naction for negligence.’ ” (Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 750.) But “the existence of\nappreciable actual injury does not depend on the plaintiff’s ability to attribute a\nquantifiable sum of money to consequential damages.” (Ibid.)\n\n                                             25\n\f       Plaintiffs’ reliance on SFUSD, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1318</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, is misplaced because\nthe distinction in that case between the threat of future harm and appreciable harm\nforming the damages element of the strict liability or negligence cause of action rested on\nthe unique nature of the harm at issue—that of asbestos contamination in buildings. (Id.\nat p. 1330 [“Physical injury resulting from asbestos contamination, not the mere presence\nof asbestos, must have occurred before a cause of action for strict liability or negligence\ncan accrue in an asbestos-in-building case”].) By contrast, plaintiffs’ economic\ninvestment in the 412(i) Plan was subject to actual and appreciable harm once the IRS\nassigned defects to the Plan and plaintiffs learned they would be subject to penalties. As\nbetween “an actual, existing injury that might be remedied or reduced in the future, and a\nspeculative or contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future” (Jordache,\nsupra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 754), the former applies here. The Chois knew they were being\ninjured in some amount but aspired for a remedy or reduction to the injury through a\nthird-party representative’s negotiations with the IRS and potential remedial changes to\nthe American General policies. We conclude under these circumstances that plaintiffs\nhad knowledge of harm to their financial interest sufficient to trigger inquiry notice and\nto support a legally cognizable claim for damages.\n\n            3. The Statute of Limitations Period Was Not Tolled While Plaintiffs and\n               Defendants Cooperatively Challenged the IRS Assessment of the Plan\n       Plaintiffs contend that even if the September 2007 e-mail constituted notice of\nactual damages, causing the action to accrue, longstanding tolling rules applicable to\nprofessions including lawyers and doctors dictate that the statute of limitations does not\nrun in favor of a fiduciary while the fiduciary relationship continues. Plaintiffs urge us to\napply the rule here, where defendants continued to advise and advocate on behalf of the\nChois during the IRS audit of the 412(i) Plan. Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in\nfailing to consider the continuing relationship between plaintiffs and defendants while\nthey cooperatively sought to defeat or minimize IRS penalties. Defendants respond that\n\n\n                                             26\n\fplaintiffs improperly seek to raise this argument for the first time on appeal. They argue\nthat even if a fiduciary relationship existed between plaintiffs and defendants, no legal\nauthority supports plaintiffs’ contention that the statute of limitations was tolled while the\nparties cooperatively tried to minimize plaintiffs’ damages.\n       We note that although plaintiffs did not raise the tolling argument in their\nopposition papers before the trial court, their counsel argued at the hearing that\ndefendants “are estopped from claiming statute of limitations.” (See Brown v. Bleiberg\n(1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1165408\"><a href=\"/opinion/1165408/brown-v-bleiberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438 [noting “the rationale of the tolling doctrine is estoppel”].) In\nsupport, counsel cited certain exhibits purporting to show defendants reassuring the\nChois, before and after September 2007, that they should not act on or worry about the\nIRS audit, since Pension Professionals and their lawyers were fighting the IRS on\nplaintiffs’ behalf.10 The trial court, as explained ante, refused to consider the argument\nand cases that were not in plaintiffs’ opposition papers, deeming it unfair to defendants.\n       An appellate court ordinarily “will not consider an argument ‘raised in an appeal\nfrom a grant of summary judgment . . . if it was not raised below and requires\nconsideration of new factual questions.’ ” (Noe v. Superior Court (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 (Noe); Winchester Mystery House, LLC v. Global Asylum, Inc.\n\n\n       10\n           One of the exhibits cited by plaintiffs’ counsel appears to support our earlier\nconclusion that plaintiffs were subject to actual and appreciable harm as of September\n2007. (See ante, Discussion section II.C.2.) The evidence shows that plaintiffs, in\nAugust 2006, agreed to pay a $5,000 retainer and share up to a maximum of $12,500 in\nadditional legal fees with Pension Professionals to defend against the IRS audit,\nconstituting another form of cognizable legal damages caused by establishment of the\n412(i) Plan. (See Apple Valley, supra, 98 Cal.App.4th at p. 949 [finding the school\ndistrict’s “out-of-pocket expenses . . . incurred when it engaged its accountant and legal\ncounsel, in an effort to determine the extent of the improper payments and arrange for\nreimbursement of funds improperly received, constituted actual injury for limitations\npurposes”]; Jordache, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 761 [noting that the defendant’s “neglect\nrequired [the plaintiff] to pay defense costs in the Marciano action for years and to lose\ninvestment opportunities for those funds”].)\n\n\n                                             27\n\f(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594-595 (Winchester).) But we may “consider a newly\nraised issue ‘when [it] involves purely a legal question which rests on an uncontraverted\nrecord which could not have been altered by the presentation of additional evidence.’ ”\n(Noe, supra, at p. 335.) To the extent that plaintiffs’ tolling argument raises a purely\nlegal question and has been briefed by both sides on appeal, we may consider it. We\ndecline, however, to consider any disputed factual issues that were not properly before\nthe trial court, including evidence that plaintiffs sought to add to the record on the day of\nthe summary judgment hearing. (Winchester, supra, at pp. 594-595 [finding plaintiff had\nforfeited theory on appeal that was not argued to the trial court and required application\nof a legal test employing a series of factual determinations].)\n       Plaintiffs propose that so long as a financial advisor continues to advise the client\nor represent the client’s interest in the transaction that gives rise to legal claims, the\naction should be tolled until the advisor-client relationship has terminated. Plaintiffs\nconcede there is no specific statutory tolling provision for financial advisors, but argue\nthe rationale behind tolling in analogous circumstances applies equally here. For\nexample, the statute of limitations in an attorney malpractice action is tolled while “[t]he\nattorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which\nthe alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.” (§ 340.6, subd. (a)(2).)\n       In other cases, a confidential or fiduciary relationship between a defendant and a\nplaintiff will toll the statute of limitations. (Amtower v. Photon Dynamics, Inc. (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The rationale is that “such relationships carry a\nduty of full disclosure and delaying accrual of the statute ‘prevents the fiduciary from\nobtaining immunity for an initial breach of duty by a subsequent breach of the obligation\nof disclosure.’ ” (Amtower, supra, at p. 1597, quoting Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy,\n\n                                               28\n\fCathcart & Gelfand (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1396310\"><a href=\"/opinion/1396310/neel-v-magana-olney-levy-cathcart-gelfand/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 189.) For similar reasons, a defendant’s\nalleged fraud in concealing a cause of action may toll the statute of limitations “for that\nperiod during which the claim is undiscovered by plaintiff or until such time as plaintiff,\nby the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered it.” (Sanchez v. South\nHoover Hospital (1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1267464\"><a href=\"/opinion/1267464/sanchez-v-south-hoover-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99.) Still in other contexts, courts recognize the\neffect of a continuing fiduciary relationship not by tolling the statute of limitations, but\nby applying a reduced burden of discovery on the beneficiary. (Eisenbaum v. Western\nEnergy Resources, Inc. (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 [insider-promotor selling limited\npartnership interest to subscriber “ ‘is entitled to rely upon the assumption that his\nfiduciary is acting in his behalf’ ”].)\n       Plaintiffs assert that the relationship between a client and financial planner or\ninvestment advisor is fiduciary as a matter of law (Hasso v. Hapke (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140)—a proposition that defendants do not contradict and we accept for\nthe purpose of considering plaintiffs’ argument. 11 While plaintiffs did not allege tolling\nof the statute of limitations, the argument is framed by the allegation in the complaint that\ndefendants concealed and failed to disclose known risks as IRS scrutiny of the 412(i)\nPlans progressed, while attributing any fault to American General. Still, plaintiffs’\ncontention fails as a matter law for the reason previously stated: plaintiffs were on\ninquiry notice as of September 2007 of the facts constituting injury and indicating they\nhad received bad advice. Delayed accrual due to the fiduciary relationship does not\n\n       11\n          Fiduciary duties may be imposed by law, as in “ ‘certain technical, legal\nrelationships such as . . . trustees and beneficiaries, principals and agents, and attorneys\nand clients,’ ” or may be determined as a question of fact, based on the nature of the\nconfidential relationship that gives rise to a fiduciary duty under common law. (Hasso v.\nHapke, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 140 [referring to the investment advisor-client\nrelationship as fiduciary by law].) The statutory definition of investment advisor “also\nincludes any person who uses the title ‘financial planner’ . . .” and engages in the\nbusiness of advising others about investing in securities. (Corp. Code, § 25009,\nsubd. (b).)\n\n\n                                              29\n\fextend beyond the bounds of the discovery rule, which operates to protect the plaintiff\nwho “ ‘despite diligent investigation . . . is blamelessly ignorant of the cause of his\ninjuries’ ” and should not be barred from asserting a cause of action for wrongful conduct\n“ ‘before he could reasonably be expected to discover its existence.’ ” (E-Fab, Inc. v.\nAccountants, Inc. Services (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1318 (E-Fab).)\n       Here, the only conclusion to be drawn from the evidence leading up to and\nincluding the September 2007 e-mail is that plaintiffs were not shielded from the\nknowledge that the IRS was questioning the validity of 412(i) Plan, had identified\nmultiple defects that would require unwinding or conversion to another type of plan, and\nhad informed Cunning of forthcoming penalties. Plaintiffs, in fact, had agreed in August\n2006 to share the legal costs of defending against the IRS actions. Like in Amtower, in\nwhich we declined to apply the tolling principles to a scenario in which the defendants\nhad “disclosed the facts necessary to support” the plaintiff’s cause of action (Amtower,\nsupra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 1597), we find that even assuming a fiduciary relationship\nbetween defendants and plaintiffs, plaintiffs as of September 2007 were aware of the\nfacts necessary to support their causes of action. We conclude that the nature of the\nrelationship between plaintiffs and defendants did not prevent or delay the Chois from\ndiscovering wrongdoing beyond September 2007.\n\n            4. Accrual of the Statute of Limitations Was Not Limited to a Single Cause\n               of Action or Damages Claim\n       Plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s application of the statute of limitations to bar\nthe entire action. They assert that they suffered “several different injuries arising out of\nmultiple instances of poor investment advice,” each of which represents an invasion of a\ndifferent primary right and constitutes a separate cause of action. Plaintiffs argue that\nbecause each injury alleged in the complaint is distinct and arises from separate, bad\nadvice, defendants failed to meet their initial burden on summary judgment by showing\nthat each distinct cause of action was barred by the limitations defense.\n\n\n                                              30\n\f       Like the tolling argument, this legal theory appears fully developed for the first\ntime on appeal. Plaintiffs’ written opposition to the summary judgment motion mentions\nnothing about causes of action left unaddressed by the defendants’ motion, although\nplaintiffs’ counsel did attempt to argue that point at the hearing. He maintained that\ndefendants took “a very simplistic and narrow view of the case” and ignored “a\nsubstantial part of the complaint and various allegations,” thereby failing to meet their\nprima facie burden “to dispose of an entire cause of action and not just to laser focus in\non tax advice and tax penalties.” These arguments go to the heart of defendants’ initial\nburden as the party moving for summary judgment to show that each cause of action,\n“even if not separately pleaded,” had no merit or was barred by a complete defense.\n(§ 437c, subd. (p)(2).) Consequently, we address the purely legal issue for the first time\non appeal. (Winchester, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at pp. 594-595.)\n       As a general proposition, plaintiffs are correct that under California’s “primary\nright” theory of code pleading, we determine the causes of action alleged in the complaint\n“based on the injury to the plaintiff, not on the legal theory or theories advanced to\ncharacterize it.” (Skrbina v. Fleming Companies (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1364\n(Skrbina); accord Crowley v. Katleman (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451389\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451389/crowley-v-katleman/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681-682 (Crowley).)\n“Thus, if a plaintiff states several purported causes of action which allege an invasion of\nthe same primary right he has actually stated only one cause of action. On the other\nhand, if a plaintiff alleges that the defendant’s single wrongful act invaded two different\nprimary rights, he has stated two causes of action, and this is so even though the two\ninvasions are pleaded in a single count of the complaint.” (Skrbina, supra, at p. 1364.)\n       In support of their argument that the statute of limitations defense narrowly\naddressed injury only in the form of IRS penalties, plaintiffs seek to differentiate each\niteration of alleged harm and relate it to a different injury or primary right. For example,\nthey contend they were first damaged “based upon the advice regarding deductibility”\nwhen they converted their 412(i) Plan to a traditional 412 Plan and had to pay additional\n\n                                             31\n\fexcise tax because the deductions previously taken were not deductible under the 412\nPlan. They contend that they were separately damaged by defendants’ incorrect advice\nabout the need to file a form 8886 with their 2004 and 2005 tax returns—resulting in IRS\npenalties, and by advice that they would have an “irrevocable contractual right” to\npurchase certain universal life policies in year eight of the program—resulting in the loss\nof promised benefits when the policies were not available, and by advice to buy new life\ninsurance policies for the converted 412 Plan—resulting in a loss when those policies\nwere liquidated, and so on.\n       We are not persuaded by this piecemeal interpretation of injury post hoc. “The\nmost salient characteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the violation of a\nsingle primary right gives rise to but a single cause of action.” (Crowley, supra, 8 Cal.4th\nat p. 681.) It is, simply put, “the plaintiff’s right to be free from the particular injury\nsuffered.” (Ibid.) Viewed in these terms, “ ‘a cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary\nright’ of the plaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a wrongful act\nby the defendant constituting a breach of that duty.” (Ibid.) The gravamen of plaintiffs’\naction as framed by the complaint in this case was that defendants advised plaintiffs to\nestablish and fund a section 412(i) Plan with tax shelter features that, unsurprisingly,\ntriggered IRS penalties, back taxes, and required conversion to a traditional 412 Plan,\ncausing further economic losses due to disallowed deductions and lost insurance policy\nbenefits. Each claimed injury traces to, and is not distinct from, the same source of\nwrongful conduct—namely defendants’ bad advice concerning establishment of the\n412(i) Plan and purchase of the life insurance policies. The fact that plaintiffs pleaded\nmultiple legal theories of recovery, and that damages accrued in stages, does not\ntransform one primary right into many. “The manner in which a plaintiff elects to\norganize his or her claims within the body of the complaint is irrelevant to determining\nthe number of causes of action alleged under the primary right theory.” (Hindin v. Rust\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1247</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1257 (Hindin).)\n\n                                               32\n\f       Even more to the point, application of plaintiffs’ theory would be somewhat novel\nhere, given that the “primary right theory has a fairly narrow field of application” most\ncommonly invoked “when a plaintiff attempts to divide a primary right and enforce it in\ntwo suits.” (Crowley, supra, 8 Cal.4th at p. 682.) While we understand by analogy\nplaintiffs’ attempt to show distinct damages due to separate instances of poor advice\nalleged in the complaint (id. at p. 684 [court “not averse to drawing analogies from the\nprimary right theory when appropriate”]), plaintiffs’ claims are not divisible under the\nrubric proposed. If, hypothetically, plaintiffs had sought to enforce their purportedly\ndistinct claims for damages in separate law suits (such as by alleging negligence in one\nsuit and fraud in a second suit, or by alleging negligent advice regarding the section\n412(i) Plan in one suit and regarding conversion to the 412 Plan in the second suit), the\nlikely outcome would be a plea in abatement (if the first suit remained pending) or a\ndefense of res judicata (if the first suit had terminated on the merits). (Crowley, supra, at\np. 682; see, e.g., Johnson v. American Airlines, Inc. (1984) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In E-Fab, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1308</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court addressed circumstances in which claims against the defendant accrued at\na different time than claims against a former employee. The plaintiff was the victim of\nembezzlement by the employee; the defendant accounting agency had recruited and\nplaced the employee with plaintiff upon representing that it had screened her background,\ncredentials, and references. (Id. at pp. 1313-1314.) In reviewing the grant of demurrer\non statute of limitations grounds, the court recognized that “the accrual trigger” for the\ncase against the defendant agency was the plaintiff’s discovery that it had misrepresented\n\n                                             33\n\fthe employee’s record and qualifications, not earlier notice of the employee’s fraud. (Id.\nat p. 1323.)\n       In Pooshs v. Philip Morris USA, Inc. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 792 (Pooshs), the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that a later-discovered physical injury caused by tobacco\nuse can be considered separate and distinct from an earlier-discovered physical injury, for\nstatute of limitations purposes, but expressly confined its holding to “latent disease cases,\nwithout deciding whether the same rule should apply in other contexts.” The court\ndistinguished latent disease like the plaintiff’s lung cancer from earlier-occurring disease\nlike the plaintiff’s COPD based on the showing—accepted as true given the procedural\nposture—“ ‘that COPD is a separate illness, which does not pre-dispose or lead to lung\ncancer and that it has nothing medically, biologically, or pathologically to do with lung\ncancer.’ ” (Id. at p. 802.) Given the separate and distinct nature of the later-occurring\ninjury, the court drew on its reasoning in an earlier decision which held that appreciable\nharm from tobacco addiction in the form of economic injury (i.e., cost of purchasing\ncigarettes) did not begin the running of the statute of limitations on a suit to recover\ndamages for physical injury (i.e., emphysema and periodontal disease) later resulting\nfrom that addiction. (Id. at p. 799, citing Grisham v. Philip Morris U.S.A., Inc. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2638174\"><a href=\"/opinion/2638174/grisham-v-philip-morris-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643-646.)\n       Finally, in Hindin, supra, 118 Cal.App.4th at pages 1258 through 1259, the court\ndetermined that the trial court had improperly granted summary adjudication where the\naction for malicious prosecution asserted only a single cause of action, based on a single\nprimary right, even though the underlying lawsuit breached that primary right in two\nways. In contrast, the court in Edward Fineman Co. v. Superior Court (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1116-1118 (Fineman), determined that each of 23 unauthorized\nchecks paid by the defendant bank constituted a “separate and distinct alleged obligation\nor claim” (id. at p. 1118) for purposes of summary adjudication, even though the\nplaintiff’s complaint aggregated the 23 claims into a single cause of action.\n\n                                              34\n\f       As applied here, Hindin is inapposite, because this case is not a malicious\nprosecution action in which the underlying litigation involved different primary rights.\nFineman and E-Fab are distinguishable based on the nature of the claims at issue.\nWhereas in Fineman, the processing of each fraudulent check represented “a separate and\ndistinct wrongful act” that could be assessed independently as a separate cause of action\n(Fineman, supra, 66 Cal.App.4th at p. 1118), the different manifestations of injury in this\ncase represent an ongoing series of consequences all traceable to the same underlying bad\nadvice. In E-Fab, the nature of the respective claims required the court “to segregate\n[the] plaintiff’s claims against its employee . . . from its claims against [the] defendant,\nrecognizing that each may accrue at a different time.” (E-Fab, supra, 153 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1322.) In contrast, because the series of injuries claimed in this case all trace to the\nsame underlying conduct committed by the same defendants, there is no basis to assign a\nlater accrual date once plaintiffs had “ ‘reason to suspect an injury and some wrongful\ncause . . . .’ ” (Id. at p. 1319; Fox, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 803.) To the extent that the\nnarrow holding in Pooshs has any application here, we note that unlike a plaintiff who\ndevelops one disease but has no reason to suspect the future occurrence of a still-latent\ndisease (Pooshs, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 802), plaintiffs’ knowledge that the IRS would\nissue penalties under the section 412(i) Plan and had recommended unwinding the Plan\nor converting to a traditional 412 Plan provided ample reason to suspect and investigate\nother inevitable economic consequences.\n       In sum, our conclusion that the statute of limitations began to run on plaintiffs’\ncauses of action as of September 2007 extends to all claims arising from the allegations\nthat defendants improperly induced the Chois into establishing the 412(i) Plan and\nfunding it in a manner that was bound to trigger IRS scrutiny. The trial court\nconsequently did not err in finding that plaintiffs’ action was time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n                                              35\n\f                               III.
