Brodie was found guilty by a jury of\nconspiring to trade with Cuba in violation of the American Cuban\nembargo currently in place under the provisions of the Trading with\nthe Enemy Act of 1917 (“TWEA”) and the Cuban Assets Control\nRegulations (“CACRs”). The United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania, ruling on a previously reserved\nmotion for judgment of acquittal, thereafter acquitted the Defendant\non the ground that there was insufficient evidence of his knowing and\nwillful participation in the charged conspiracy to support conviction.\nUnited States v. Brodie, 268 F. Supp. 2d 408 (E.D. Pa. 2002). After\nreviewing the government’s evidence against the Defendant, we\nconclude that the District Court erred in entering the judgment of\nacquittal, and accordingly, we vacate the judgment, reinstate the jury\nverdict, and remand for further proceedings which may, on the\npresent record, include a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                  2\n\f                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      The American Cuban Embargo\n\n        The backdrop for this appeal is the American Cuban embargo\nagainst trading with Cuba which derives in the first instance from the\nTWEA, 50 U.S.C. App. § 1 et. seq. The TWEA as originally enacted\ndealt only with the President’s use of economic powers in times of\nwar, but was expanded in 1933 to deal with national emergencies that\narose during peacetime. See Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 226 n.2\n(1984). Section 5(b) of the TWEA, in pertinent part, authorizes the\nPresident, through a designated agency, to “investigate, regulate, ...\nor prohibit ... transactions involving, any property in which any\nforeign country or a national thereof has any interest, by any person,\nor with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States.” 50 U.S.C. App. § 5(b)(1)(B).1 Section 16, in turn,\ncriminalizes willful violation of any “order of the President issued in\ncompliance with the provisions of th[e TWEA].” 50 U.S.C.App.\n\n       1\n         TWEA Section 5(b) was amended in 1977 to limit the\nPresident’s authority once again to times of war, but the same law\ncontaining that limitation (i.e., The International Emergency\nEconomic Powers Act (“IEEPA”)) also grand-fathered existing\nexercises of the President’s national emergency authority (including\nthe American Cuban embargo) and permitted the President to extend\ntheir exercise in one year intervals where in the national interest. The\nCuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (popularly known as\nLIBERTAD), enacted in 1996, continued the Cuban embargo\nindefinitely and effectively suspended the IEEPA’s requirement that\nthe President revisit the basis for the American Cuban embargo each\nyear. See 22 U.S.C. §§ 6021-6091; see also United States v.\nPlummer, 221 F.3d 1298, 1307-1308 & n.6 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(reviewing this history).\n\n                                   3\n\f§ 16. Presidential authority under the TWEA has been delegated to\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, who has in turn delegated that authority\nto the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). See Regan, 468\nU.S. at 226 n.2 (citing Exec. Order No. 9193, 3 C.F.R. 1174, 1175\n(1942) and Treasury Department Order No. 128 (Rev. 1, Oct. 15,\n1962)). In 1963, the CACRs were promulgated pursuant to TWEA\nSection 5(b) to impose an embargo against Cuba in an effort “to deal\nwith the peacetime emergency created by Cuban attempts to\ndestabilize governments throughout Latin America.” Regan, 468\nU.S. at 226. The CACRs incorporated and expanded upon prior\neconomic sanctions already imposed against Cuba. See id. at 226 &\nn.4.\n\n       Of particular importance to this appeal is CACR § 515.201(b)\nwhich provides:\n\n       (b)       All of the following transactions are\n                 prohibited except as specifically authorized by\n                 the Secretary of the Treasury (or any person,\n                 agency, or instrumentality designated by him)\n                 by means of regulations, rulings, instructions,\n                 licenses, or otherwise, if such transactions\n                 involve property in which any foreign country\n                 designated under this part,[2] or any national\n\n       2\n           CACR § 515.201(d) provides:\n\n       For the purposes of this part, the term ‘foreign country\n       designated under this part’ and the term ‘designated\n       foreign country’ mean Cuba and the term ‘effective\n       date’ and the term ‘effective date of this section’ mean\n       with respect to Cuba, or any national thereof, 12:01\n       a.m., e.s.t., July 8, 1963.\n\n                                   4\n\f               thereof, has at any time on or since the\n               effective date of this section had any interest\n               of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect:\n\n               (1) All dealings in, including, without\n               limitation, transfers, withdrawals, or\n               exportations of, any property or evidences of\n               indebtedness or evidences of ownership of\n               property by any person subject to the\n               jurisdiction of the United States; and\n\n               (2) All transfers outside the United States with\n               regard to any property or property interest\n               subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nSee 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b) (2005); see also 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b)\n(1992); 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b) (1993); 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b)\n(2000). As CACR § 515.201(b) suggests, business transactions\ninvolving Cuba may be specifically authorized by OFAC; here,\nhowever, it is uncontested that no such authorization was ever\nobtained for the business transactions that gave rise to the underlying\nprosecution.\n\n       The phrase “person subject to the jurisdiction of the United\nStates” as used in CACR § 515.201(b) is defined in CACR\n§ 515.329, 31 C.F.R. § 515.329, which provided, at the time the\nconspiracy charged in this case was allegedly in effect:\n\n\n\n\n31 C.F.R. § 515.201(d) (2005).\n\n                                  5\n\f       The term ‘person subject to the jurisdiction of the\n       United States’ includes:\n\n       (a) Any individual, wherever located, who is a citizen\n       or resident of the United States;\n\n       (b) Any person within the United States as defined in\n       § 515.330;\n\n       (c) Any corporation organized under the laws of the\n       United States or of any State, territory, possession, or\n       district of the United States; and\n\n       (d) Any corporation, partnership, or association,\n       wherever organized or doing business, that is owned\n       or controlled by persons specified in paragraphs (a) or\n       (c) of this section.\n\n31 C.F.R. § 515.329 (1993) (emphasis added); see also 31 C.F.R.\n§ 515.329 (2000); 50 Fed. Reg. 27435 (July 3, 1985).3 The critical\n\n       3\n        Effective March 24, 2003, CACR § 515.329 was revised to\nprovide:\n\n       (c) Any corporation, partnership, association, or\n       other organization organized under the laws of the\n       United States or of any State, territory, possession, or\n       district of the United States; and\n       (d) Any corporation, partnership, association, or other\n       organization, wherever organized or doing business,\n       that is owned or controlled by persons specified in\n       paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section.\n\n\n                                  6\n\fphrase “owned or controlled” in CACR § 515.329(d) is not defined\nin the CACRs, but notably, the CACRs have included a broad\n“person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” feature from\ntheir inception. See 28 Fed. Reg. 6974, 6978 (July 9, 1963) (CACR\n§ 515.329).\n\n        The effect of the prohibition against entities “owned or\ncontrolled by persons specified in [31 C.F.R. § 515.329 (a) or (c)]”\nfrom undertaking any of the transactions prohibited by CACR\n§ 515.201(b), was substantially muted in prior years by a regulatory\nexemption permitting foreign subsidiaries of companies owned or\ncontrolled by American citizens to trade with Cuba under certain\nconditions, as well as liberal application of the licensing provision by\nOFAC. See 31 C.F.R. § 515.559 (1975); 40 Fed. Reg. 47108 (Oct. 8,\n1975).4 See also Ralph H. Folsom,1 INT ’L BUS. TRANS. § 18.4 (2d ed.\n2004); Harry L.

TRANS. §18.4.\n\n        In 1992, Congress enacted the Cuban Democracy Act, Act of\nOct. 23, 1992, 106 Stat. 2575, codified at 22 U.S.C. §§ 6001-6010,\nwhich, inter alia, rescinded OFAC’s authority to issue licences for the\nexport of goods to Cuba by “persons subject to the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States.” See 22 U.S.C. § 6005(a) (popularly known as the\n“Mack Amendment”). See also Clara David, “Trading With Cuba:\nThe Cuban Democracy Act and Export Rules,” 8 FLA . J. INT ’L Law\n385 (Fall 1993) (author, then a licensing officer for OFAC, stating\nthat the Cuban Democracy Act eliminated the prior exemption to the\nCuban embargo for trade by foreign subsidiaries of American firms).\nThe Cuban Democracy Act took effect on October 23, 1992, and the\nCACRs were subsequently amended to reflect the Act’s strict\nprovisions. See 31 C.F.R. § 515.559 (1993).5 In March 1996,\n\n       5\n           CACR § 515.559 currently provides, in pertinent part:\n\n       (a) Effective October 23, 1992, no specific licenses\n       will be issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section\n       for transactions between U.S.-owned or controlled\n       firms in third countries and Cuba for the exportation\n       to Cuba of commodities produced in the authorized\n       trade zone or for the importation of goods of Cuban\n       origin into countries in the authorized trade zone,\n       unless, in addition to meeting all requirements of\n       paragraph (b), one or more of the following conditions\n       are satisfied:\n                (1) The contract underlying the proposed\n\n                                   8\n\fCongress further strengthened the American Cuban embargo by\nenacting the LIBERTAD.

The LIBERTAD mandates that the American Cuban\nembargo, including all restrictions imposed by the CACRs, “remain\nin effect” unless and until the embargo is suspended or terminated in\naccordance with statutory procedures. 22 U.S.C. § 6032(h) (cross-\nreferencing 22 U.S.C. § 6064 (“Termination of the economic\nembargo of Cuba”)). Such procedures, in turn, make suspension or\ntermination of the embargo contingent upon a change of political\npower in Cuba. See 22 U.S.C. § 6064; see also 22 U.S.C. § 6065.\nNumerous countries, including the European Union, Canada and\nMexico, reacted to the strengthening of the American Cuban\n\n\n       transaction was entered into prior to October 23,\n       1992;\n               (2) The transaction is for the exportation of\n       medicine or medical supplies from a third country to\n       Cuba, which shall not be restricted [except under\n       certain laws or in certain cases];\n               (3) The transaction is for the exportation of\n       telecommunications equipment from a third country,\n       when the equipment is determined to be necessary for\n       efficient and adequate telecommunications service\n       between the United States and Cuba.\n       (b) Specific licenses will be issued in appropriate\n       cases for certain categories of transactions between\n       U.S.-owned or controlled firms in third countries and\n       Cuba, where local law requires, or policy in the third\n       country favors, trade with Cuba.

The Indictment\n\n        The Defendant Stefan E. Brodie and his brother Donald B.\nBrodie (“Don Brodie”) were co-owners of The Bro-Tech Corporation,\nan entity incorporated in Delaware, which manufactured and sold ion\nexchange resins for industrial use in water purification under the trade\nname “The Purolite Company.” The Bro-Tech Corporation was\nheadquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, and had a\nmanufacturing plant and warehouse facility located in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania. The Defendant was the president of The Bro-Tech\nCorporation; his brother Don Brodie was the vice-president. Purolite\nproduct was sold by salesmen operating from sales offices located\nthroughout North America, including one in Ontario, Canada\n(“Purolite Canada”) from which James E. Sabzali (“Mr. Sabzali”), a\nCanadian citizen, worked from approximately 1990 to 1995 until\npromoted to a marketing position based in the Bala Cynwyd office.\n\n      The Defendant, Don Brodie and The Bro-Tech Corporation\nowned, in approximately 1/3 shares, another corporation known as\n\n        6\n         The American Cuban embargo’s purported extraterritorial\nreach has been criticized by numerous commentators. See, e.g.,\nClark, “Dealing with Extraterritorial Sanctions,” 20 U. PA . J. INT ’L\nECON . L. 61; Ellicott, “Between a Rock and a Hard Place,” 27 STET .\nL. REV . 1465; Kam S.

Purolite International Limited (alternatively called “the\nU.K. entity” herein to differentiate it from “The Purolite Company”\nor the “U.S. entity”) had its own board of directors, sales people, and\nfinance department. The Brodie brothers, however, ultimately owned\nand controlled the U.K. entities as well as the U.S. entities.\n\n        In late 1996-early 1997, the United States Customs Service\n(which investigates illegal exports on behalf of OFAC) received\ninformation leading it to suspect that The Purolite Company was\ntrading in violation of the American Cuban embargo. Customs agents\nthereafter met with a Purolite official at the Bala Cynwyd office on\nFebruary 5, 1997, and, following some initial exchange of documents\nbetween the agents and the company, a prosecutor was assigned and\ngrand jury subpoenas were issued to the company. On October 5,\n2000, a grand jury indicted the Defendant, Don Brodie, The Bro-Tech\nCorporation d/b/a/ “The Purolite Company,” and Mr. Sabzali on a\nsingle count of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 371 (criminalizing\nthe act of “conspir[ing] either to commit any offense against the\nUnited States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof”)\nand 18 U.S.C. § 2 (criminalizing the act of “aid[ing] and abet[ting]\nthe commission of a crime against the United States”) by engaging in\ntransactions involving property with Cuba in contravention of the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        Together, the Defendant, Don Brodie and The Bro-Tech\nCorporation owned 95% of the shares in Bro-Tech Limited; 5% of the\nshares were owned by a third-party.\n\n                                  11\n\fTWEA, 50 U.S.C. App. §§ 5(b) & 16,8 and CACR § 515.201(b), 31\nC.F.R. § 515.201(b). The conspiracy was alleged to have existed\nfrom approximately April 1993 to May 2000. Overt acts in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy were alleged to have begun on or about\nJune 21, 1994 and to have ended on or about July 31, 1999. The\novert acts involved the sale of ion exchange resins, payment for the\nproduct, and the payment of expenses related to business travel\nundertaken by Don Brodie, Mr. Sabzali and others to, from and\nwithin Cuba. Additionally, the grand jury indicted Don Brodie, The\nBro-Tech Corporation, and Mr. Sabzali for 76 additional substantive\nviolations of the TWEA and CACRs tied to specific sales of Purolite\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Section 16 of the TWEA provides:\n\n       Whoever shall willfully violate any of the provisions\n       of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39 and 41 to 44 of\n       this Appendix] or of any license, rule, or regulation\n       issued thereunder, and whoever shall willfully violate,\n       neglect, or refuse to comply with any order of the\n       President issued in compliance with the provisions of\n       the Act [said sections] shall, upon conviction, be fined\n       not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, be\n       fined not more than $100,000, or imprisoned for not\n       more than ten years, or both; and the officer, director,\n       or agent of any corporation who knowingly\n       participates in such violation shall, upon conviction,\n       be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned for not\n       more than ten years or both.\n\n50 U.S.C. App. § 16(a) (West 2004) (brackets in the original).\n\n                                 12\n\fproduct and expense-related transactions.9 The Defendant was\ncharged only with conspiracy to violate the TWEA and CACR\n§ 515.201(b) as alleged in the first count of the indictment.\n\n       C.      Proceedings Below\n\n        The District Court denied numerous pre-trial defense motions\nto dismiss the indictment. In particular, on August 14, 2001, the\nDistrict Court denied motions to dismiss the indictment based on (1)\nan alleged inconsistency between the CACRs and Section 620(a) of\nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. § 2370, and President\nKennedy’s February 3, 1962 Proclamation 3447 (27 Fed. Reg. 1085);\n(2) an alleged failure of President Kennedy to declare a national\nemergency with respect to Cuba; (3) an alleged unconstitutional\ndelegation of legislative powers to the Executive Branch by Section\n5(b) of the TWEA; and (4) an alleged termination of the President’s\nauthority under Section 5(b) of the TWEA due to the fact that the\nexercise of that authority by President George H.W. Bush on\nSeptember 13, 1991, was not published in the Federal Register until\nSeptember 23, 1991. Additionally, on October 24, 2001, the District\nCourt denied motions to dismiss all or parts of the indictment based\n\n\n\n       9\n         A fifth defendant, John H. Dolan, former director of\npurchasing for The Purlolite Company with whom the Customs\nagents met in the Bala Cynwyd office in February 1997, was also\nindicted for one count of making false statements to government\nofficials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a). Mr. Dolan’s trial was\nsevered from that of his co-defendants, and he later pleaded guilty to\na superceding information charging one count of concealing\ninformation on imported articles and containers in violation of 19\nU.S.C. § 1304(a). Mr. Dolan was sentenced to six months probation\nand fined $2,000.\n\n                                 13\n\fon principles of international comity, the foreign sovereign\ncompulsion doctrine10 and lack of jurisdiction.\n\n        The four defendants, each separately represented by counsel,\nwere then tried together in a single trial. At the close of the\ngovernment’s evidence, the Defendant made a motion pursuant to\nFed.R.Crim.P. 29(a) for judgment of acquittal. The District Court\nreserved the motion pursuant to Rule 29(b),11 and the defense\nthereafter put on its case. In charging the jury, the District Court gave\na willful blindness instruction over the objection of the defense,\nthereby instructing the jury that it could find the knowledge element\nof the crime to be satisfied if it concluded beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the Defendant had deliberately closed his eyes to what otherwise\n\n\n\n        10\n          See Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d\n1287, 1293 (3d Cir. 1979) (explaining, in the context of an antitrust\naction, that “[t]he sovereign compulsion defense is not principally\nconcerned with the validity or legality of the foreign government’s\norder, but rather with whether it compelled the American business to\nviolate American antitrust law.”).\n        11\n             Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b) provides:\n\n        Reserving Decision. The court may reserve decision\n        on the motion, proceed with the trial (where the\n        motion is made before the close of all the evidence),\n        submit the case to the jury, and decide the motion\n        either before the jury returns a verdict or after it\n        returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without\n        having returned a verdict. If the court reserves\n        decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the\n        evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.\n\n                                   14\n\fwould have been obvious to him concerning the facts in question.12\nThe jury then found all defendants guilty of the conspiracy charge in\nCount I. Additionally, Don Brodie was found guilty of 33, The Bro-\nTech Corporation of 44, and Mr. Sabzali of 20, of the separate\nsubstantive counts related to specific sales of Purolite product and\nexpense-related transactions.13 The jury also found The Bro-Tech\nCorporation subject to a forfeiture of $665,737.\n\n        Following post-trial briefing and oral argument, the District\nCourt on May 31, 2002, granted the Defendant’s motion for judgment\nof acquittal on the ground that there was insufficient evidence from\nwhich the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe Defendant had knowingly and willfully participated in the\nconspiracy. 268 F. Supp. 2d 408. In granting the motion, the District\nCourt reasoned that the government’s evidence showed the Defendant\ndid not know it was unlawful under the CACRs for Purolite\nInternational Limited, incorporated in and operating from the United\nKingdom (“U.K. entity”), to trade with Cuba if The Purolite\nCompany, incorporated in and operating from the United States\n(“U.S. entity”), was not involved. See id. at 417. Additionally, the\nDistrict Court reasoned that, to the extent the government had proven\nthat the U.S. entity was actually involved in particular transactions,\nthe evidence also showed the Defendant was unaware of such\ninvolvement. See id. The government filed the present appeal.\n\n\n\n         12\n              See United States v. Stewart, 185 F.3d 112, 126 (3d Cir.\n1999).\n         13\n         Don Brodie, The Bro-Tech Corporation and Mr. Sabzali\nwere acquitted on all counts involving sales made in the time period\nof 1997-1999, four of the sales made in 1996 and three of the sixteen\ncounts involving expense-related transactions.\n\n                                    15\n\f        Approximately a year later, the District Court denied the\nmotions for judgment of acquittal filed by Don Brodie, The Bro-Tech\nCorporation and Mr. Sabzali, finding their convictions (including\nthose for conspiracy to violate the TWEA and CACRs) supported by\nsufficient evidence. United States v. Brodie, 268 F. Supp. 2d 420,\n423-424 (E.D. Pa. 2003). However, in that same ruling, the District\nCourt also granted all four defendants a new trial on the ground that\nthe government had made certain improper and inflammatory\ncomments and argument during its opening and closing statements\nwhich prejudiced the jury. See id. at 424-35. Importantly, the District\nCourt granted a new trial for the Defendant conditional on the\noutcome of the pending appeal. See id. at 436. The government\nappealed also from the order granting a new trial, and that appeal was\nconsolidated by this Court with the present appeal. Thereafter, on\nOctober 15, 2003, this Court granted the government’s motion to\nremand the appeal taken from the grant of a new trial to allow the\nDistrict Court to consider the guilty pleas of Don Brodie, The Bro-\nTech Corporation and Mr. Sabzali.14 The District Court then\ndismissed all remaining counts of the indictment as to these three\ndefendants, and the government voluntarily dismissed its appeal of\nthe order granting a new trial. Thus, the only issue before this Court\nis the propriety of the judgment acquitting the Defendant.\n\n\n\n       14\n         Subsequently, Don Brodie pleaded guilty to Count 36 of the\nindictment (involving his approval of expenditures in the amount of\n$4,187 for Mr. Sabzali’s Cuba-related travel) and was sentenced to\none year probation and fined $10,000. The Bro-Tech Corporation\nalso pleaded guilty to Count 36 of the indictment, and was fined\n$250,000. Mr. Sabzali pleaded guilty to a superceding information\ncharging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2 (aiding and abetting) and § 545\n(smuggling goods into the United States), and was sentenced to one\nyear probation and fined $10,000.\n\n                                  16\n\f            II. STANDARD AND SCOPE OF REVIEW\n\n        In ruling on a motion for judgment of acquittal made pursuant\nto Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, a district court must “‘review the record in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any\nrational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt based on the available evidence.’” United States v.\nSmith, 294 F.3d 473, 476 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v.\nWolfe, 245 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir. 2001)). A finding of insufficiency\nshould be “‘confined to cases where the prosecution’s failure is\nclear.’” Smith, 294 F.3d at 477 (quoting United States v. Leon, 739\nF.2d 885, 891 (3d Cir. 1984)). Courts must be ever vigilant in the\ncontext of Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 not to usurp the role of the jury by\nweighing credibility and assigning weight to the evidence, or by\nsubstituting its judgment for that of the jury. See United States v.\nJannotti, 673 F.2d 578, 581 (3d Cir. ) (en banc) (trial court usurped\njury function by deciding contested issues of fact), cert. denied, 457\nU.S. 1106 (1982); see also Charles A. Wright, 2A FED . PRAC. & PRO .\n(Criminal 3d) § 467 at 311 (2000) (“A number of familiar rules\ncircumscribe the court in determining whether the evidence is\nsufficient ... It is not for the court to assess the credibility of\nwitnesses, weigh the evidence or draw inferences of fact from the\nevidence. These are functions of the jury.”). On appeal from the\ngrant or denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this Court\nexercises plenary review and independently applies the same standard\nas the district court. See United States v. Coleman, 811 F.2d 804, 807\n(3d Cir. 1987); Jannotti, 673 F.2d at 598.15\n\n       15\n          The Defendant urges this Court not to view the evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the government in conducting our review\ndue to the prosecutorial misconduct which, inter alia, gave rise to the\ngrant of a new trial. We reject this invitation as based on a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the standard, as this Court is not\n\n                                  17\n\f        Our scope of review is dictated by the procedural posture in\nwhich this case comes before us. The Defendant moved for a\njudgment of acquittal at the close of the government’s case pursuant\nto Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a), and the District Court reserved decision on\nthe motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b). Accordingly, the District\nCourt was required to, and properly did, determine whether an\nacquittal was appropriate based solely on the evidence presented by\nthe government. See Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b) (“[i]f the [trial] court\nreserves decision, it must decide the motion on the basis of the\nevidence at the time the ruling was reserved”). The Advisory\nCommittee Notes to the 1994 Amendments to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29\nprovide that an appellate court, reviewing a judgment of acquittal\nunder Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b), is “similarly limited.” Advisory\nCommittee Notes to 1994 Amendments. Thus, in reviewing the\njudgment of acquittal entered below, we too will examine only to the\nevidence presented in the government’s case, which includes\nevidence elicited on cross-examination of the government witnesses,\nbut not evidence presented in the defense case. See id.; see also\nUnited States v. Finn, 375 F.3d 1033, 1037 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\n        The elements of conspiracy – i.e., “an agreement, either\nexplicit or implicit, to commit an unlawful act, combined with intent\nto commit an unlawful act, combined with intent to commit the\nunderlying offense” – can be proven entirely by circumstantial\nevidence. United States v. Kapp, 781 F.2d 1008, 1010 (3d Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 475 U.S. 1024 (1986); see also Smith, 294 F.3d at 477 (listing\nrequirements for conspiracy and principle that they may be proven\nentirely by circumstantial evidence); United States v. Fuentes-Coba,\n738 F.2d 1191, 1196 (11th Cir. 1984) (listing same factors for\nconspiracy under the TWEA), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1213 (1985).\n\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict\nentered below.\n\n                                 18\n\fIndeed, the very nature of the crime of conspiracy is such that it often\nmay be established only by indirect and circumstantial evidence. See,\ne.g., Blumenthal v. United States, 332 U.S. 539, 557 (1947) (because\n“[s]ecrecy and concealment are essential features of successful\nconspiracy,” the law “rightly gives room for allowing the conviction\nof those discovered upon showing sufficiently the essential nature of\nthe plan and their connections with it, without requiring evidence of\nknowledge of all its details or of the participation of others”). Thus,\n“[t]he existence of a conspiracy ‘can be inferred from evidence of\nrelated facts and circumstances from which it appears as a reasonable\nand logical inference, that the activities of the participants ... could\nnot have been carried on except as the result of a preconceived\nscheme or common understanding.’” Smith, 294 F.3d at 477 (quoting\nUnited States v. Gibbs, 190 F.3d 188, 197 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting\nKapp, 781 F.2d at 1010)) (ellipsis in the original).\n\n        We must, however, give “close scrutiny” to the sufficiency of\nthe government’s evidence in a conspiracy case, see Coleman, 811\nF.2d at 807, for the reasons that “[s]light evidence of a defendant’s\nconnection with a conspiracy is insufficient to support a guilty\nverdict,” id. at 808, and “guilt must remain personal and individual.”\nUnited States v. Samuels, 741 F.2d 570, 575 (3d Cir. 1984).\nConspiracy cannot be proven “by piling inference upon inference”\nwhere those inferences do not logically support the ultimate finding\nof guilt. Coleman, 811 F.2d at 808.\n\n        In conducting the sufficiency inquiry, we do not view the\ngovernment’s evidence in isolation, but rather, in conjunction and as\na whole. “The court must determine ‘whether all the pieces of\nevidence, taken together, make a strong enough case to let a jury find\n[the defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.’” Coleman, 811\nF.2d at 807 (quoting United States v. Allard, 240 F.2d 840, 841 (3d\nCir. 1957)). See also United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 600\n\n\n                                  19\n\fF.2d 414, 417 (3d Cir. 1979) (“‘[T]he character and effect of a\nconspiracy (is) not to be judged by dismembering it and viewing its\nseparate parts, but only by looking at it as a whole.’”) (quoting United\nStates v. Patten, 226 U.S. 525 (1913)) (parenthesis in the original).\n“To sustain a conspiracy conviction, the ‘contention that the evidence\nalso permits a less sinister conclusion is immaterial. ... [T]he\nevidence need not be inconsistent with every conclusion save that of\nguilt.’” Smith, 294 F.3d at 478 (quoting United States v. Dent, 149\nF.3d 180, 188 (3d Cir. 1998)).\n\n                         III. DISCUSSION\n\n        The bulk of the evidence presented by the government during\nthe joint trial of the Defendant and his three indicted co-conspirators\ndid not directly involve the Defendant’s participation in the\nunderlying conspiracy, but rather the accomplishment of particular\nillegal acts by Don Brodie and Mr. Sabzali. The District Court, in\nruling on the Defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, noted that\nthe Defendant and the government had agreed during oral argument\non the motion that:\n\n       a reasonable jury could find that [The] Bro-Tech\n       [Corporation] made the following sales to Cuba\n       through intermediaries ...\n\n       1. From 1992 to 1993, four sales were made by\n       Bro-Tech through a Canadian company. The sales\n       were booked at Bro-Tech, and the product was\n       manufactured by and shipped from Purolite\n       International. These sales were not charged in the\n       indictment.\n\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\f       2. From 1994 to 1996, thirty-five sales were made by\n       Bro-Tech through intermediaries in Canada and\n       Mexico. At times the product sold was manufactured\n       by and shipped from Bro-Tech, and at other times\n       Purolite International.\n\n       3. From 1997 to 1999, twenty-four sales were made\n       by Bro-Tech through the intermediary San Marco. All\n       sales in this period were booked at Purolite\n       International, and the product was manufactured by\n       and shipped from Purolite International.\n\n268 F. Supp. 2d at 410-11. The fact that these sales transactions\noccurred, and the manner in which they were booked, manufactured\nand shipped, is important background to the evidence presented\nagainst the Defendant, but rather than set forth the evidence which\nwould support these facts, we too will incorporate this list of proven\ntransactions accepted by the District Court. See id.\n\n         Against the Defendant, the government presented what we\nwill categorize as six key pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the\nbasic company structure; (2) the “billing instruction,” and series of\nevents related to the 1992 audit of The Bro-Tech Corporation; (3) the\n“our friends in the Caribbean” speech; (4) Mr. Sabzali’s 1995\nperformance review; (5) the pervasive use of “code words” for Cuba\nby employees of The Bro-Tech Corporation d/b/a/ The Purolite\nCompany; and (6) several post-investigation events. This evidence\nis set forth in Section III.A of this opinion. In Section III.B, because\nwe recognize that further proceedings on remand may include a new\ntrial, we clarify the intent requirement for conspiracy to violate the\nTWEA and CACRs, and address the efficacy of the Defendant’s\nintent-based defense which posited that he did not understand it was\nunlawful for the U.K. entity to trade with Cuba and/or did not know\n\n\n                                  21\n\fthat the U.S. entity was actually involved in the trading. In Section\nIII.C, we assess the government’s evidence against the Defendant as\na comprehensive whole and in the light most favorable to the\ngovernment as required by the governing standard.\n\n       A.      The Evidence Against The Defendant\n\n       1.      Basic company structure\n\n        As noted above, the Defendant was the President and co-\nowner with his brother Don Brodie of The Bro-Tech Corporation,\nd/b/a “The Purolite Company.” Together with The Bro-Tech\nCorporation, the Defendant and Don Brodie also owned, in\napproximately 1/3 shares, Bro-Tech Limited, which was incorporated\nin the United Kingdom. Bro-Tech Limited, in turn, controlled\nPurolite International Limited, which was also incorporated in the\nUnited Kingdom. Both the U.S. and the U.K. entities were controlled\nby the Brodies. The Bro-Tech Corporation made over $2.1 million\ndollars in gross income from its trade with Cuba.\n\n        In his capacity as President, the Defendant oversaw the\nfinances of The Bro-Tech Corporation and Purolite International\nLimited, had direct supervision of Edward Grossman (who was The\nBro-Tech Corporation’s Chief Financial Officer), and served as the\nprimary contact for legal counsel to the company. The Defendant\nalso oversaw the European sales force, while Don Brodie oversaw the\nNorth American sales force and Philadelphia manufacturing facility.\nEdward Nace, a former products manager for The Purolite Company\nfrom 1993 to 1997 who worked from the Bala Cynwyd office as a\nliaison between sales and manufacturing, testified that both the\nDefendant and Don Brodie reviewed on a “fairly frequent[]” basis the\nhard-copy log book of daily purchase orders kept at the Bala Cynwyd\noffice, which listed customer name, type and quantity of product\n\n\n                                 22\n\fordered. Later, when the company switched to a computerized\nsystem, both brothers would review the daily “edit reports” listing\norders.\n\n        The office in Bala Cynwyd was located on one part of one\nfloor in an office building that housed numerous other companies.\nApproximately 30 employees worked in the Bala Cynwyd office,\nincluding both the Defendant and Don Brodie over the course of the\ncharged conspiracy, as well as Mr. Sabzali beginning in early 1996.\nMr. Sabzali and Don Brodie shared a secretary in the Bala Cynwyd\noffice, at least through early 1998, and the Defendant’s secretary, at\nleast through early 1998, had her desk physically located directly\noutside of Mr. Sabzali’s office.\n\n        On cross-examination, Mr. Grossman testified that during the\nrelevant time period (1993 to 2000), the Defendant spent a\n“significant amount of time” (estimated at 70 to 80 %) away from the\nBala Cynwyd office establishing new manufacturing plants and sales\noffices in China and Romania.\n\n       2.      The billing instruction, audit and related events\n\n        During 1992, from his office in Canada, Mr. Sabzali sold\nPurolite product through the Canadian subsidiary (“Purolite Canada”)\nin four transactions to Galax, Incorporated (“Galax”). The product\nwas booked and invoiced from the Bala Cynwyd office, but\nmanufactured by and shipped from the U.K. entity. In 1986, the\nUnited States Department of Treasury had designated Galax a\n“specially designated national,” i.e., a company with which American\ncompanies were prohibited from transacting business because the\n\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\fdesignated company was known to have ties with Cuba.16 While\nthese 1992 transactions with Galax were not charged in the\nindictment, they are important background to much of the evidence\npresented against the Defendant because trial testimony established\nthat, in early 1993, the auditing firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP\nconducted an audit of The Bro-Tech Corporation for the year 1992\nand found reference to one of the 1992 sales to Galax. The auditor-\nin-charge, Mr. Stephen Coulter, CPA, brought the reference directly\nto the Defendant’s attention, and this touched off a series of events,\nevidence of which forms the basis for the linchpin inference urged by\nthe government in this prosecution – i.e., that the Defendant knew his\ncompany was conducting illegal sales transactions with Cuba and\nknew that the U.S. entity was involved, or was at least willfully blind\nto that involvement. That the 1992 transaction with Galax had\noccurred and how the auditor’s concern about it was handled by the\nDefendant are critical. While the trial testimony concerning this\nseries of events was often confusing and sometimes contradictory, we\nattempt to set it forth as coherently as possible and in the light most\nfavorable to the government.\n\n        We begin with the evidence related to what we will call “the\nbilling instruction.” Mr. Grossman (former CFO of The Bro-Tech\nCorporation) testified on direct examination that he was personally\naware of a sales transaction made to Galax in 1992. He explained\nhow he came to possess that knowledge:\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          A senior enforcement investigations officer of OFAC,\ntestifying for the government, explained the term SDN, that Galax\nwas an SDN, and that it had been so designated in 1986. See 31\nC.F.R. § 500.306 (defining “specially designated national”); see also\n31 C.F.R. Ch. V, App. A (2005) (listing Galax, Inc. as an SDN).\n\n                                  24\n\f       Q:      And how do you know that – or how were you\n               aware of it? ...\n\n       A:      Yes. During the year, in 1992 at some point,\n               [the Defendant] called me into his office and\n               indicated that there had been an invoice, this\n               Galax, and that it had a reference to Cuba on\n               there and that I should instruct the customer\n               service department, the billing department, to\n               make certain that they don’t include any\n               reference to Cuba in any future invoices on the\n               face of the invoice.\n\n       Q:      Was that in 1992?\n\n       A:      I believe so.\n\n       Q:      Did you give such an instruction to the billing\n               department?\n\n       A:      Yes, I did.\n\nA. 716 (Grossman, direct).\n\n        Next is the evidence related to the audit. Deloitte & Touche\nhad been performing audits for The Bro-Tech Corporation since\napproximately 1988, and for the year 1992, had been engaged to\nexpress an opinion on the combined financial statements of The Bro-\nTech Corporation and Bro-Tech Limited. In the course of performing\nthe 1992 audit early in 1993, the auditors “found a shipment into\nCuba on a sales transaction .... [in a] dollar amount ... between 2 and\n$300,000...” A. 304 (Coulter, direct). The occurrence of this\ntransaction was significant to the auditors because, as Mr. Coulter\n\n\n                                  25\n\fexplained, “[w]e are aware that U.S. companies were not supposed to\nbe shipping goods into Cuba because of the American boycott,” and\n“to the extent a transaction is a potential illegal act, the auditor is\nobligated to follow up on that transaction to determine the potential\nconsequences both from a financial reporting as well as a disclosure\npoint of view.” A. 304-05 (Coulter, direct). The auditors were\nconcerned that The Bro-Tech Corporation would be subject to a\nmonetary fine for the Galax transaction, which, depending on the\nlikelihood of assessment, would have to be addressed in the audit in\na particular fashion. In light of this concern, Mr. Coulter spoke\ndirectly to the Defendant, as President of The Bro-Tech Corporation,\nabout the Galax transaction and its implications for the audit. Mr.\nCoulter testified as to that conversation:\n\n       Q:      Was that [conversation with the Defendant]\n               on the telephone or face to face or in what\n               way?\n\n       A:      Well, there were numerous discussions\n               regarding the liability. Some were by\n               telephone, some were face to face and we did\n               have discussions, in addition to [the\n               Defendant] had discussions with Ed\n               Grossman.\n\n               ...\n\n       Q:      And when you talked to [the Defendant], what\n               was his explanation regarding this\n               transaction?\n\n       A:      [The Defendant] indicated that the transaction\n               had been effected by a new salesman with the\n\n\n                                  26\n\f               company and that it was one transaction and\n               he understood that they should not be doing\n               this, and he was going to take steps to insure\n               that the company would detect any such\n               proposed transactions in the future.\n\nA. 307 (Coulter, direct). Other testimony supported that the Galax\nsale under discussion had been arranged by Mr. Sabzali operating\nfrom Canada, and that he had been a salesman for the company since\napproximately 1990 – i.e., two to three years before the outlined\nconversation. Two “steps” were taken in the wake of the\nconversation between the Defendant and Mr. Coulter concerning the\nGalax transaction. We present these “steps” first as filtered through\nthe eyes of the auditors and then as they were “implemented” by The\nBro-Tech Corporation.\n\n        Subsequent to the conversation outlined above, the Defendant\nshowed Mr. Coulter a copy of the following memorandum written on\nPurolite letterhead:\n\n       April 7, 1993\n\n       To:     All Sales Offices\n\n       From: Steve Brodie\n\n       CC:     Don Brodie/Ed Grossman\n\n       It has come to our attention, during the 1992 audit,\n       that a sale was made to the Canadian Company,\n       Galax. The Galax credit was checked in our\n       Philadelphia office, and approved. Subsequent to the\n\n\n\n                                   27\n\f       approval of the order, our shipping department in the\n       UK was ordered to drop-ship this order to Cuba.\n\n       While it is proper to ship this order from the UK in\n       terms of UK law, it is contrary to USA policy and law\n       to ship material of any kind to the island nation of\n       Cuba in violation of the US embargo. Brotech\n       Corporation is a US Corporate citizen, and as such,\n       has no intention of violating US policy, now nor in the\n       future.\n\n       No shipment of Purolite merchandise is to be shipped\n       to, redirected to, or trans-shipped to Cuba. Any\n       requests to do so are to be reported to Don or me.\n\n       /s/ Steve Brodie\n\nA. 206 (Gov. Ex. 11) (hereinafter the “future policy memorandum”)\n(emphasis added). In addition to being the purported issuer of the\nfuture policy memorandum, the Defendant had also signed it. Mr.\nCoulter, however, did not find the memorandum helpful for deciding\nhow to characterize the Galax transaction for auditing purposes, and\nhis reaction to the memorandum set off another important response\nfrom the Defendant. As Mr. Coulter explained:\n\n       Q:      When you saw this document, were you\n               satisfied it took care of the problem?\n\n       A:      No, we were not.\n\n       Q:      And why not?\n\n\n\n\n                                  28\n\f        A:       Well, essentially that was certainly appropriate\n                 going forward to insure that there were no\n                 shipments to Cuba and we fully supported\n                 that, however, the fact of the matter was that\n                 there was a shipment in 1992 to Cuba and we\n                 did not know the legal ramifications of that.\n                 And we were requesting from the company a\n                 legal opinion with respect to their exposure.\n\n        Q:       And what was [the Defendant’s] reaction\n                 when you told him you wanted a legal\n                 opinion?\n\n        A:       Well, again, because it was a single\n                 transaction performed by a salesman that was\n                 new to the company, [the Defendant] felt like\n                 we were overreacting in requesting a legal\n                 opinion and he did not want to incur the cost\n                 of a legal opinion.\n\nA. 314-15 (Coulter, direct) The legal opinion requested by Mr\nCoulter was subsequently obtained, and Mr. Coulter participated in\na telephone discussion of that opinion with the attorney involved.\nMr. Coulter testified that the legal opinion, “together with\nmanagement’s representation that the transaction was unintentional\nand inadvertent,” were relied upon by the auditors in determining that\nthe possibility of a fine related to the transaction was “remote.” A.\n315 (Coulter, direct). The “remote” characterization was significant\nto the auditors because, as Mr. Coulter explained, “‘remote’ mean[t\nthat] it’s less likely that a liability [here, a fine] has been incurred, and\nin that instance there would be no requirement to either disclose or\nrecord the liability” in the audit. A. 306-07 (Coulter, direct). When\nthe 1992 audit report for The Bro-Tech Corporation was subsequently\n\n\n                                     29\n\fissued in July 1993, Deloitte & Touche also sent a letter addressed to\nthe “directors of Bro-Tech Corporation trading as the Purolite\nCompany to the attention of [the Defendant], President,” in which the\nauditors characterized the legal opinion as they had understood and\nrelied upon it in issuing the 1992 audit:\n\n       The company inadvertently entered into a sales\n       transaction with a new customer that is listed by the\n       U.S. Department of Treasury as a specially designated\n       national (SDN). Sales to SDN’s are prohibited by law\n       and carry potential civil penalties which, depending\n       on intent, could be significant. The company’s legal\n       counsel has indicated based on very limited\n       knowledge of the transaction and the related federal\n       laws that since the sale was unintentional, the\n       likelihood of fines and penalties being assessed is\n       remote in this particular case.\n\nA. 319 (Coulter, direct) (reading Gov. Ex. 4). Mr. Grossman testified\nthat he had received a copy of this letter most likely through the\nDefendant’s secretary.\n\n       Prior to the issuance of the 1992 audit report in July 1993,\nanother “step” was taken in the wake of the auditors’ concern with the\nGalax transaction. When asked if the Defendant had made any other\nsuggestions regarding what might be done with the Galax transaction\nin terms of accounting, Mr. Coulter testified:\n\n       A:      At one point in the process of dealing with\n               this issue, there was a suggestion that the sale\n               recorded in Bro-Tech Corporation’s books be\n               transferred to Bro-Tech, Limited’s [i.e., the\n               U.K. entity’s] books.\n\n\n                                 30\n\f       Q:      And what was your response to that?\n\n       A:      After considering it, we felt like we would\n               still need a legal opinion because the sales\n               transaction was initially recorded in Bro-Tech\n               Corporation’s books to begin with, and that\n               even if it were transferred to Bro-Tech,\n               Limited, we would not know the legal\n               implications of that either.\n\n       Q:      Did that go any further, that suggestion?\n\n       A:      I don’t believe it did, no.\n\nA. 320 (Coulter, direct).17 On cross-examination, Mr. Coulter\nexplained that, in addition to recommending that a legal opinion be\nobtained with respect to treatment of the Galax transaction for audit\npurposes, Deloitte & Touche recommended that a set of checks be\ninstituted by the company to make certain that SDNs would not\nbecome clients in the future. Someone from The Bro-Tech\nCorporation – although their identity is not clear – told Mr. Coulter\nthat such checks would be implemented.18 A few months after the\n\n\n       17\n         But see infra. at 32-34, reviewing Grossman’s testimony\nabout transferring the sale to the U.K. entity’s books.\n       18\n         Also on cross-examination, Mr. Coulter explained that he\nhad participated in a telephone conversation during this same time\nperiod related to the Galax transaction with someone at Coopers and\nLybrand, which was then performing audits for Bro-Tech Limited in\nthe United Kingdom. The impetus for the conversation was Deloitte\n& Touche’s engagement to express a combined audit for The Bro-\nTech Corporation and Bro-Tech Limited for 1992, and Deloitte &\n\n                                  31\n\f1992 audit report was issued in July 1993, someone from The Bro-\nTech Corporation – again their identity is unclear – informed Deloitte\n& Touche that it was being replaced by Coopers and Lybrand.19 Mr.\nCoulter acknowledged on cross-examination that Coopers and\nLybrand had already been performing audits for Bro-Tech Limited.\nHe also acknowledged that the Defendant had been upset with the\nperceived untimeliness and expense of the 1992 audit report.\n\n        Mr. Grossman provided the view from inside The Bro-Tech\nCorporation concerning how the “steps” identified by Mr. Coulter\nwere actually implemented by the company in the wake of the\nauditors’ concern with the Galax transaction. He testified that indeed\na transfer of a Galax transaction to the books of Bro-Tech Limited did\noccur, but his testimony was confusing as to whether that transfer\ninvolved the 1992 Galax transaction found by Deloitte & Touche or\nanother Galax transaction in 1993. He testified:\n\n       Q:      ... [Y]ou were aware of – you testified you\n               were aware of a Galax sale in ‘92, but you’re\n               not sure if it’s the same one that the auditors\n               found?\n\n       A:      Correct.\n\n\nTouche’s concern that there may be additional shipments to Cuba\nrelevant to the combined audit.\n       19\n          This fact was important to the government, which urged an\ninference that the switch in auditors was undertaken to punish\nDeloitte & Touche for finding and focusing on the problematic Galax\ntransaction and/or to ensure that The Bro-Tech Corporation was not\nbeing serviced by auditors already aware of and therefore more prone\nto scrutinize the company’s transactions for Cuban ties.\n\n                                 32\n\fQ:   What if any sales were you aware of to Galax\n     in 1993?\n\nA:   I’m not aware of any sales certainly that were\n     processed through the United States office.\n     Again, I believe – I’m sorry, I think that there\n     was a transaction in 1993 that had initially\n     been billed by the U.S. office and when this\n     was found a decision was made to in essence\n     transfer the sale to – so that it would come\n     through Purolite International Limited, monies\n     that were collected in connection with this\n     sale were collected by the U.S. company and\n     transferred to Purolite International Limited.\n\nQ:   Can you take a look, sir, at Government\n     Exhibit 10? Do you recognize that document?\n\nA:   Yes, I do.\n\nQ:   Is there a notation concerning something that\n     you asked to be done?\n\nA:   It’s dated March 31st, 1993. ‘Per Ed. G.,’\n     which would be myself –\n\n     ...\n\nQ:   [ ] Do you want to tell us what this is all\n     about?\n\nA:   Again, this is a handwritten note dated 3/31/93\n     and it says “Per Ed. G.,” which is myself,\n\n\n                       33\n\f               “$330,103.20 sale to be reversed, cash to be\n               reversed and forwarded to Purolite\n               International Limited,” it says, “conversation”\n               or “conversion to be Bala’s responsibility.”\n\n       Q:      Well, did you make – who if anyone made that\n               decision with you?\n\n       A:      This decision would have been made in\n               conjunction with [the Defendant], it probably\n               would have been a conversation that we had\n               once we understood that there was, you know,\n               a transaction related to Cuba and that there\n               would be funds coming into Purolite\n               Company as a result of that transaction.\n\n       Q:      Is this at the time of the audit?\n\n       A:      Yes. March 31st, ‘93, so the audit would have\n               taken place – either been completed shortly\n               before that or some time around that time\n               frame.\n\nA. 720-722 (Grossman, direct).\n\n        Mr. Grossman also testified regarding the future policy\nmemorandum, a critical piece of evidence for both the prosecution\nand the defense. Handwritten on the copy of the future policy\nmemorandum admitted at trial was a faxed notation, indicating that\nthe memorandum had been faxed as addressed on April 7, 1993, to all\nsales offices, as well as to, inter alia, Don Brodie and Mr. Grossman.\nMr. Grossman testified that he received a copy; another salesman\ntestified that he did not. In addition to the memorandum itself\n\n\n                                  34\n\fconstituting evidence, Mr. Grossman testified that it was his\nunderstanding that the memorandum encapsulated The Bro-Tech\nCorporation’s policy regarding sales to Cuba in the future. On direct\nexamination, he testified:\n\n       Q:      What if any decisions were made by [the\n               Defendant] in response to the Deloitte &\n               Touche audit?\n\n       A:      My understanding is that any – any orders\n               having to do with Cuba would be processed\n               through the U.K. company. My understanding\n               at that time was that they did not have the\n               same restrictions on shipping to Cuba and this\n               if there, you know, was business having to do\n               with that it would – material would not only\n               be shipped from Purolite Limited, but it would\n               be, you know, billed by Purolite International\n               Limited[].\n\nA. 719 (Grossman, direct). Mr. Grossman provided further critical\ntestimony regarding the future policy memorandum on cross-\nexamination, which we set forth in full:\n\n       Q:      As a result of [ ] those events [i.e., the audit\n               events just discussed, having occurred in early\n               1993], you indicated that [the Defendant]\n               issued the memorandum that you looked at\n               dated April 7, 1993 [i.e., the future policy\n               memorandum], correct?\n\n       A:      Correct.\n\n\n\n                                 35\n\fQ:   And as a result of those events the policy of\n     Purolite in the U.S. going forward was that if\n     future materials were to be shipped to Cuba\n     they would be shipped from Purolite\n     International in the United Kingdom and\n     billed by Purolite International in the United\n     Kingdom, correct?\n\nA:   That was my understanding, yes.\n\nQ:   And that was different from what had\n     happened in 1992, because in 1992 all of the\n     product had been manufactured and shipped\n     from the United Kingdom, [but] it was billed\n     out of the United States entity, correct?\n\nA:   It was billed out of the United States entity. I\n     can’t say without a doubt that a hundred\n     percent of the material came from Purolite\n     International Limited, I don’t know where all\n     of the material came to fill those orders, I\n     know that some ...\n\nQ:   Your understanding at the time was that it had\n     come from Purolite International, correct?\n\nA:   At least primarily, yeah.\n\nQ:   Now, you understood at that time that it was\n     lawful to ship product to Cuba from the\n     United Kingdom, did you not?\n\n\n\n\n                       36\n\fA:   I understood, it was explained to me at some\n     point in time that they did not have the same\n     prohibition in the United Kingdom as we have\n     in the United States.\n\nQ:   And [the Defendant] told you in 1993 that he\n     understood that it was lawful for entities in the\n     United Kingdom to ship product to Cuba,\n     correct?\n\nA:   Yes.\n\nQ:   Now, in light of that decision [i.e., in April\n     1993], your understanding of what both Bro-\n     Tech’s finance department and Bro-Tech in\n     the United States should be doing generally\n     was that there should not be any future\n     transactions involving Bro-Tech in the U.S.\n     that involved the sale of product to Cuba,\n     correct?\n\nA:   Correct.\n\nQ:   And [the Defendant] told you as part of that\n     decision [i.e., in 1993] that future invoices\n     coming out of Bro-Tech should not reflect\n     sales to Cuba, correct?\n\nA:   Correct.\n\nQ:   And that was because future sales were\n     supposed to go out of Purolite International in\n     the United Kingdom, correct?\n\n\n                        37\n\fA:   This is after – you’re talking about after the\n     Deloitte & Touche –\n\nQ:   After the Deloitte & Touche audit.\n\nA:   Correct.\n\nQ:   So your mission, as you understood it going\n     forward from 1993, was to ensure that your\n     finance department was not causing\n     transactions to be booked out of the United\n     States that involved sale of product to Cuba?\n\nA:   My understanding was that was not supposed\n     to happen. It was [the Defendant’s] and Don\n     Brodie’s company, so it wasn’t my decision as\n     to – you know, to accept orders and to conduct\n     commerce with Cuba, so my understanding is\n     that that wasn’t going to happen and that any\n     commerce with Cuba would be transacted\n     through Purolite International, Limited.\n\nQ:   ... You didn’t receive any instruction at that\n     time to delete or alter or destroy any records\n     that related to Cuba in 1993, did you?\n\nA:   That’s correct.\n\nQ:   And you didn’t give any such instructions to\n     anyone within the finance department,\n     correct?\n\nA:   That’s correct.\n\n\n                       38\n\f       Q:     So for the 1992 transactions that had\n              happened with Galax, the documents that\n              related to those remained within the finance\n              department of Bro-Tech, correct?\n\n       A:     That’s correct [presumably, this suggests that,\n              although the 1992 Galax sale had been\n              transferred to Purolite International’s books,\n              Bro-Tech in the United States still had records\n              relating to that sale and the fact that it had\n              been transferred].\n\n              ...\n\n       Q:     Now, is it fair to say that in addition to the\n              principle that sales would now be booked out\n              of the U.K., you were taking efforts to ensure\n              that if anyone affiliated with Bro-Tech\n              traveled to Cuba that the expenses associated\n              with that travel would be borne by the United\n              Kingdom entity?\n\n       A:     Yes.\n\n       Q:     And that was because based on your\n              understanding the United States entity was not\n              to be involved in activity with respect to\n              Cuba?\n\n       A:     That’s correct.\n\nA. 747-49, 752 (Grossman, cross-examination).\n\n\n\n                                39\n\f       3.     The “Our friends in the Caribbean” speech\n\n        Craig Gentile, a regional salesman for The Bro-Tech\nCorporation from 1990 to 1997, testified that the company held bi-\nannual sales meetings in the spring and fall. Asked whether Cuba or\nsales to Cuba were ever mentioned at those meetings, he testified:\n\n       A:     There was only one time that Cuba was ever\n              mentioned in a sales meeting. ... It was either\n              fall of ‘91 or spring of ‘92. And we met at the\n              manufacturing facility in Philadelphia,\n              downstairs, and everybody gave their\n              presentation on their sales and what they were\n              going to do, projections for the next year or\n              how they had done previously. And Jim\n              Sabzali got up to give his presentation and\n              during his presentation he said that this was\n              the business that they were going to be doing\n              in Cuba and ...\n\n       Q:     What happened then?\n\n       A:     [The Defendant] jumped up, he was very\n              excited – I don’t remember exactly what he\n              said, but [Mr. Sabzali] just smiled and said,\n              [‘] well I mean our friends in the Caribbean.[’]\n\n              ...\n\n       Q:     What was your reaction to what happened?\n\n       A:     I was surprised that [Mr. Sabzali] brought it up.\n\n\n\n                                40\n\f       Q:      What was the reaction of any other salespeople in the\n               room?\n\n       A:      I think everybody was surprised, it got very quiet.\n               Then we proceeded.\n\nA. 362-363 (Gentile, direct).\n\n         Mr. Gentile was questioned on cross-examination as to the\ndate of this incident. He had previously told the grand jury that the\nevent occurred in 1993 and on cross-examination at trial he\nacknowledged this previous testimony. A. 371 (Gentile, cross-\nexamination) (“[Gentile]: I don’t have the transcript, but if that’s\nwhat it says, that’s what I said.”). However, as set forth above, his\ntrial testimony placed the incident earlier in time, and before the\nevents of the 1992 audit report.\n\n       4.      Mr. Sabzali’s 1995 performance review\n\n        Mr. Sabzali, who had arranged the transactions with Galax in\n1992 from his Canadian office and who had spoken of Cuban sales\nduring the sales presentation witnessed by Mr. Gentile, was promoted\nin 1995 to the position of Director of Marketing for the North\nAmerican operations of The Bro-Tech Corporation, and reassigned as\na result from Canada to the Bala Cynwyd office. The basis for the\npromotion was summed up in a type-written performance review\ndated May 16, 1995. Critically, the performance review took note of\nMr. Sabzali’s development of the “Caribbean territory to make\nPurolite the dominant player” and his procurement of “sales in\nMexico as an adjunct to the Caribbean.” A. 207 (Gov. Ex. 14).20\n\n       20\n         As explained infra., “Caribbean” was generally understood\nand used by many Bro-Tech/Purolite employees to refer to Cuba. On\n\n                                 41\n\fHandwritten at the bottom of the performance review was the\nnotation: “New Position, Salary $102,000, Effective 4/1/94.” A\nrelated memorandum identified Mr. Sabzali’s responsibilities in the\nnew position; importantly, however, he was to “continue handling the\nCaribbean areas for North America.” Mr. Grossman testified that the\nhandwritten notation at the bottom of the performance review “looks\nlike the handwriting of – or the printing of [the Defendant],” A. 731\n(Grossman, direct),21 and another former employee, Daniel\nOpperman, testified that while it was Don Brodie who had hired Mr.\nOpperman, it was the Defendant who had promoted him.\n\n       5.      Pervasive use of “code words” for Cuba\n\n         A number of former employees of The Bro-Tech Corporation\ntestified that they understood, at the time of their employment during\nthe relevant time period, that terms like “the Caribbean,” “the island”\nand “that island” were used to refer to Cuba. Specifically, Mr.\nGrossman testified that “Caribbean island was kind of a code word\nfor Cuba after Deloitte and Touche’s findings in early 1993,” A. 725\n(Grossman, direct), and that “Caribbean meant Cuba.” Id. at 728.\n\n\ndirect examination, Mr. Grossman testified that he could recall only\none other customer in the Caribbean, and that he too understood\nCaribbean to mean Cuba.\n       21\n          As the District Court pointed out, 268 F. Supp. 2d at 416\nn.3, there were problems with Mr. Grossman’s testimony in that he\ndid not specifically clarify that he had ever seen the Defendant’s\nhandwriting, and the defense was apparently caught off-guard by the\ngovernment’s elicitation of this lay opinion testimony on handwriting\nduring the trial. However, because no objection to this testimony was\nmade at trial, we, like the District Court, will consider it legitimate\nevidence for the jury to consider.\n\n                                  42\n\fMr. Sabzali’s secretary in the Bala Cynwyd office from 1996 to early\n1998 testified that she recalled two conversations with Mr. Sabzali\nregarding Cuba, one of which she described as a “sort of smiling\nconversation where he said, we refer to it as the island, not by its\nformal name.” A. 1302 (Lenton, direct). Ms. Graves, a former\ncustomer services employee in charge of processing sales orders for\nThe Purolite Company at the Bala Cynwyd office from approximately\n1995 until her retirement in January 1999, testified that she and her\ncounterpart in the Canada office would frequently talk about\nshipments to Cuba, but specified that in so doing, “[w]e didn’t refer\nto them as shipments to Cuba, but ... as shipments to that island.” A.\n880 (Graves, direct). Mr. Nace testified that he had told Mr. Sabzali\nthat he was uncomfortable receiving faxes from Sabzali openly\nreferring to Cuba and as a result, Mr. Sabzali referred to Cuba, at least\nin dealings with Mr. Nace, as the Caribbean. Mr. Carlos Lugo, who\noperated as a salesman of The Purolite Company in Mexico from\nMay 1996 to 2000,22 testified with reference to an expense report that\nhe had turned in to the Bala Cywyd office related to travel through\nJanuary 1998 that “Mr. Ed Grossman called me and said to me that\nthat report had to be redone because I stated that I was going to\nHavana and the name Havana could not be in the report.” A. 601\n(Lugo, direct). There was also testimony that words like Havana and\n\n\n\n        22\n         Mr. Lugo testified that in September 1995, he was contacted\nby someone he characterized as the international manager of the\nPurolite Company based in Bala Cynwyd, and asked to help\nincorporate an arm of the Purolite Company in Mexico. In 1996, Mr.\nLugo “started as an employee of the Mexican entity” which was\nowned “when it was created ... 50 percent by Mr. Don Brodie and 50\npercent by [the Defendant].” A. 580 (Lugo, direct). Later, according\nto Mr. Lugo, “98 percent of the shares were transferred to The Bro-\nTech Corporation.” Id.\n\n                                   43\n\fCuba were sometimes used rather openly in transaction and expense-\nrelated documentation.\n\n       6.      Post-investigation events\n\n         On February 5, 1997, and pursuant to an earlier telephone\nconversation, Customs agents visited the Bala Cynwyd office and met\nwith Mr. Dolan. At that meeting, an agent “apprised Mr. Dolan that\nwe [Customs] had an investigation and it appeared, based on records\nthat I had in my possession and confidential source information, that\nthere were violations of illegal exports relative to the OFAC\nregulations.” A. 1447 (McCrosson, direct). According to the agent,\nMr. Dolan responded that he had “researched [the company’s] files\nbased on the previous phone call and said he could only locate one\ndocument relative to the names I had provided him.” Id. Mr. Dolan\nthen showed the agents a copy of the future policy memorandum,\nwhich purported to state as a matter of company policy that the U. S.\nentity was not to be involved in any sales to Cuba. With this\nbackground, we present the evidence related to the post-investigation\nevents.\n\n       a.      The Sabzali memoranda\n\n        The government introduced three memoranda written by Mr.\nSabzali in the weeks following the Customs agents’ visit. The first,\ndated February 28, 1997, and addressed to Pilar Guzman, a woman\nthrough whom Purolite product was sold to Cuban end-users,\nprovided in pertinent part: “Please note that pricing to San Marco\nwill change slightly for the four orders being ready, as well as for\nfuture orders. The reason is that we now have to ship products from\nU.K., and the easiest method would be to ship directly to Havana, and\nnot to Tampico.” A. 1310-11 (Lenton, direct, reading from Gov. Ex.\n77) (emphasis added). The first memorandum did not identify the\n\n\n                                 44\n\fDefendant as someone intended to receive a copy – he was not, in\nother words, “carbon copied” on the first memorandum. The second\nmemorandum, also dated February 28, 1997, was addressed to an\nItalian representative of The Purolite Company, and provided, in\npertinent part: “For future reference, please note that orders will be\nsent from Milan to Pontyclun, but invoicing will be done directly\nfrom Ponty to the customer in the Caribbean.” A. 1313 (Lenton,\ndirect, reading from Gov. Ex. 78) (emphasis added). The subject line\non the second memorandum referenced “four orders for the\nCaribbean.” Id. The Defendant was carbon copied on this second\nmemorandum, and the secretary who faxed it testified that he would\nhave received his copy in the Bala Cynwyd office. The third\nmemorandum, dated March 3, 1997, and carbon copied to the\nDefendant, provided further details regarding the “Caribbean orders,”\nconfirmed that the sales would be handled entirely through Purolite\nInternational Limited, and openly listed the place of shipment as\nHavana, Cuba.\n\n       b.      Telephone calls\n\n        The government offered testimony related to two telephone\ncalls made by the Defendant after the investigation which lead to the\nindictment was underway. In September 1999, months after she had\nretired from The Purolite Company, Ms. Graves, the former sales\nprocessing clerk, received a telephone call from the Defendant at her\nhome. She testified:\n\n       A:      He asked me if I had been contacted by\n               anyone from the Government regarding the\n               Cuba sales.\n\n       Q:      And what did you say?\n\n\n\n                                 45\n\f       A:      I said yes, I had, and then he – I mentioned\n               that I had been questioned about, I believe it\n               was the shipments for Galax, and I mentioned\n               that there were other shipments after those,\n               and I said but I can’t remember the name of\n               the company.\n\n       Q:      Shipments where?\n\n       A:      To Cuba. And he said [‘] well, if you can’t\n               remember the name, then you don’t have\n               anything to tell them.[’]\n\nA. 881 (Graves, direct). As noted above, the Defendant agreed during\noral argument on the motion for acquittal that other evidence in the\ngovernment’s case would support a finding that “from 1994 to 1996,\nthirty-five sales were made by Bro-Tech through intermediaries in\nCanada and Mexico.” See supra. at 20-21. The intermediary in\nMexico was an entity known as Ingenieria y Mantenimiento Industrial\n(or “IMI”) and shipments to IMI occurred after the Galax sales. Ms.\nGraves testified that, as a former sales processing clerk, she knew of\nthe sales through IMI. On cross-examination, Ms. Graves\nacknowledged that the Defendant had expressed “interest and\ncuriosity” about the subject matter of the government investigation\nduring their telephone conversation, and that she knew at the time she\nwas interviewed by the government that the company had legal\ncounsel whom she did not advise of the interview. Additionally, she\ntestified that she had reported the telephone call to the government\nand agreed to have a wire installed on her phone to record any future\ncalls from the Defendant, but he never called again.\n\n       The second telephone call identified by the government was\npurportedly made by the Defendant to Mr. Lugo, the Purolite\n\n\n                                 46\n\fsalesman in Mexico. Mr. Lugo testified that he had met someone at\nthe United States Embassy in Mexico City at the request of the United\nStates government sometime after December 1997 or 1998.23 There,\nhe was asked “some questions regarding why I went to Cuba. ... if I\ngo to Cuba for business or anything.” A. 607 (Lugo, direct).\nSubsequent to that meeting, Mr. Lugo reported on it at Mr. Sabzali’s\nrequest to Mr. Dolan. Mr. Lugo testified that he then received a\ntelephone call from the Defendant:\n\n       Q:      What if any conversations did you have with\n               [the Defendant] about your embassy visit?\n\n       A:      After my visit, [the Defendant] called me and\n               said to me not to do it again with[out] inform\n               – informing before.\n\n       Q:      Not to do what again?\n\n       A:      To go to the [United States] embassy.\n\nA. 612 (Lugo, direct).           On cross-examination, Mr. Lugo\nacknowledged that he knew at the time of his interview at the United\nStates Embassy that the company was represented by counsel and\nunder investigation for trading with Cuba. He also acknowledged\nthat he had previously testified before the grand jury that the embassy\nvisit occurred sometime in April or May 1999, and that it was Mr.\nSabzali, not the Defendant, who informed him following that visit\n\n       23\n         It is unclear from the record, and apparently unclear to Mr.\nLugo himself, exactly why he was contacted by the United States and\nasked to visit the Embassy in Mexico City. He had, however,\npreviously had two boxes of Cuban cigars confiscated from him by\nthe United States Customs Service in Washington, D.C.\n\n                                  47\n\fthat the Defendant did not want him to go to the embassy again\nwithout informing the company.\n\n       B.      The Intent Requirement\n\n        On appeal, the Defendant argues in support of a separate\nground for affirming the judgment of acquittal – specifically, that the\ngovernment was required and failed to show that the Defendant had\nknowledge of the specific CACR or licensing provision which he and\nhis co-conspirators were found to have violated. This argument relies\non an inaccurate statement of the law, which we find necessary to\ncorrect in order to guide the District Court on remand should there be\na new trial.\n\n       The Defendant was indicted for conspiracy to violate Section\n16 of the TWEA and CACR § 515.201(b), and accordingly the\ngovernment, in proving a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, was\nrequired to prove at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for\nthe underlying substantive offense of violating the American Cuban\nembargo. See United States v. Feola, 420 U.S. 671, 686 (1975). To\nprove conspiracy to violate the TWEA and the CACRs, the\ngovernment is required to show “specific intent.” See Fuentes-Coba,\n738 F.2d at 1196 (prosecution for violating the American Cuban\nembargo); United States v. Macko, 994 F.2d 1526 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(same); see also United States v. Tooker, 957 F.2d 1209 (5th Cir.)\n(prosecution for violating American embargo on trading with\nVietnam), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 864 (1992); United States v. Dien\nDuc Huynh, 246 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n        In the context of the TWEA, the specific intent requirement\ndemands that the government prove that a defendant had general\nknowledge of the law which forbade his actions and acted with the\nspecific intent to circumvent that law. See Tooker, 957 F.2d at 1214.\n\n\n                                  48\n\fBut the government need not prove the defendant had knowledge of\nthe specific regulation governing the conduct engaged in – in other\nwords, a defendant “cannot ‘avoid prosecution by claiming that [he\nor she] had not brushed up on the law.’” Id. (quoting Hamling v.\nUnited States, 418 U.S. 87, 123 (1974)). See also Bryan v. United\nStates, 524 U.S. 184 (1998) (conviction for “willfully” violating\nfederal statute prohibiting sale of firearm without license requires a\nshowing that the defendant knew his conduct was unlawful, not that\nhe was aware of the particular licensing requirement); id. at 196\n(“Thus, the willfulness requirement of § 924(a)(1)(D) does not carve\nout an exception to the traditional rule that ignorance of the law is no\nexcuse; knowledge that the conduct is unlawful is all that is\nrequired”); Liparota v. United States, 471 U.S. 419, 434 (1985)\n(explaining in the context of prosecution for acquiring possession of\nfood stamps in a manner unauthorized by statute or regulations that\nthe government need not show “knowledge of specific regulations\ngoverning food stamp acquisition or possession.”); United States v.\nTsai, 954 F.2d 155, 162 (3d Cir.) (stating in context of conviction for\nviolating Arms Export Control Act, “[i]f the defendant knew that the\nexport was in violation of the law, we are hard pressed to say that it\nmatters what the basis of that knowledge was.”), cert. denied, 506\nU.S. 830 (1992). “Rather, the government must prove only that the\ndefendant[] knew that [his] planned conduct was legally prohibited\nand that [he] therefore acted with an ‘evil-meaning mind.’” Tooker,\n957 F.2d at 1214 (quoting Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246,\n251 (1952)). A jury may infer a willful violation of a known legal\nobligation from the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.\nSee Tooker, 957 F.2d at 1214 (citing Liparota); Macko, 994 F.2d at\n1535 (concluding “the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury\nto find beyond a reasonable doubt that [the defendants] knew about\nthe Cuban trade embargo and deliberately violated it through their\nown conduct or by aiding and abetting other individuals.”); Dien Duc\nHuynh, 246 F.3d 743 (same in context of the Vietnam embargo); see\n\n\n                                  49\n\falso United States v. Covarrubias, 94 F.3d 172, 175-76 (5th Cir.\n1996) (finding, in context of prosecution for exporting weapons into\nMexico, sufficient evidence to support jury’s conclusion that\ndefendant knew that either a license or some other form of\nauthorization was required to lawfully transport weapons).\n\n        Of course, in this criminal conspiracy case, like any other, the\ngovernment must prove that the defendant had knowledge of the facts\nthat constitute the offense and of the illicit purpose of the conspiracy.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Idowu, 157 F.3d 265, 267 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(explaining, in the context of a challenge to the sufficiency of the\nevidence for a conspiracy conviction, that “the government is obliged\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge\nof the particular illegal objective contemplated by the conspiracy”);\nUnited States v. Pearlstein, 576 F.2d 531, 540-41 (3d Cir. 1978)\n(stating, in the context of reversing conviction for mail fraud, that\n“the evidence must indicate that the defendants had knowledge of the\nfraudulent nature of the [ ] operation and wilfully participated in the\nscheme with the intent that its illicit objectives be achieved”); see\nalso Bryan, 524 U.S. at 193 (“‘knowingly’ merely requires proof of\nknowledge of the facts that constitute the offense”). The knowledge\nelement of a crime such as the one charged here may be satisfied\nupon a showing beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had\nactual knowledge or “deliberately closed his eyes to what otherwise\nwould have been obvious to him concerning the fact in question.”\nUnited States v. Stewart, 185 F.3d 112, 126 (3d Cir. 1999). To find\nknowledge premised on the latter “willful blindness” theory, the jury\nmust be able to conclude that “the defendant himself was objectively\naware of the high probability of the fact in question, and not merely\nthat a reasonable man would have been aware of the probability.”\nUnited States v. Caminos, 770 F.2d 361, 365 (3d Cir. 1985). Willful\nblindness is not to be equated with negligence or lack of due care, and\ndoes not allow a conviction simply because the defendant “should\n\n\n                                   50\n\fhave known of facts of which he or she was unaware.” United States\nv. Wert-Ruiz, 228 F.3d 250, 255 (3d Cir. 2000) (willful blindness is\na “subjective state of mind that is deemed to satisfy the scienter\nrequirement of knowledge”); see also United States v. Sharma, 190\nF.3d 220, 231 (3d Cir. 1999) (purpose of a willful blindness\ninstruction is to “ensure[] that a juror who believed that a defendant\nturned a blind eye towards his co-defendant’s conduct would not vote\nto acquit the willfully blind defendant”). As noted, the government\npursued the willful blindness theory of knowledge at trial and the\nDistrict Court provided a correct willful blindness instruction to the\njury.\n\n         The indictment and the evidence presented by the government\nin this case naturally tended to divide the overt acts in furtherance of\nthe conspiracy into two time frames: (1) 1994 (when the first overt\nact was alleged to have occurred) through late 1996, and (2) early\n1997 (when Customs agents first visited the Bala Cynwyd office) to\nMay 2000 (the end of the alleged conspiracy).24 We understand the\ndefense to have incorporated these two time frames into its argument\nas to why the government failed to prove that the Defendant acted\nwith the requisite intent. He argues on appeal that the evidence “is\nconsistent with the fact that [he] did not know that any transactions\nwith Cuba were being carried out unlawfully through the United\nStates. Rather, he believed that all transactions with Cuba were being\n\n       24\n         Indeed as the Defendant states in his brief on appeal, “[t]he\ngovernment introduced evidence that, from 1994-1996, [The] Bro-\nTech [Corporation] engaged in transactions that ultimately involved\nCuba. From 1997-1999, however, [The] Bro-Tech [Corporation] did\nnot engage in sales to Cuba. Rather, sales to Cuba in 1997-1999 were\nhandled by PIL [Purolite International Limited] in the United\nKingdom, without United States involvement.” Brief of Appellee at\n10.\n\n                                  51\n\fhandled lawfully by entities in Canada and the United Kingdom\nwithout United States involvement.” Brief of Appellee at 11. In\nother words, the Defendant contends that he believed at all times\npertinent to the charged conspiracy that trading with Cuba was lawful\nso long as conducted through the U.K. entity without the participation\nof the U.S. entity. To the extent that the evidence showed the U.S.\nentity was actually involved in the transactions from 1994 through\n1996 (which, as noted above, the Defendant agreed the evidence\ncould prove), then Defendant posits that he did not know of that\ninvolvement, and hence could not have willfully violated the law. As\nfor the transactions which occurred from early 1997 through the end\nof the charged conspiracy, the Defendant posits that he did not know\nthat trading with Cuba through a foreign subsidiary owned or\ncontrolled by a American citizen was illegal, and hence could not\nhave acted with intent to violate the law.\n\n         Implicit in this defense strategy (and indeed obvious from the\nface of the future policy memorandum that the Defendant purportedly\nwrote and relies heavily upon for his defense) is an admission that the\nDefendant understood that the U.S. entity was prohibited from trading\nwith Cuba, and indeed, that was a correct interpretation of the law.\nTo the extent that the Defendant also believed it was lawful for the\nU.K. entity to trade with Cuba so long as the U.S. entity was not\ninvolved, his interpretation of the law was incorrect, because as\nwritten, the CACRs prohibit entities which are “owned or controlled”\nby American citizens from trading with Cuba. See 31 C.F.R.\n§§ 515.201(b), 515.329 (a), (c).25 We do not find it necessary,\n\n       25\n         The Defendant informs us in a footnote in his brief on appeal\nthat “evidence in the defense case demonstrated that [the Defendant]\ntolerated these transactions only because he believed – based on\ninformation from the British government and Bro-Tech’s outside\ncounsel, Morgan Lewis [& Bockius LLP] – that it would be illegal in\n\n                                  52\n\fhowever, to determine whether the Defendant’s mistaken\nunderstanding of the law as it related to trade conducted solely\nthrough the U.K. entity in the latter time period should negate a\nfinding of specific intent and thereby support acquittal because, for\nreasons that will become clearer as we examine the reasonable\ninferences that arise from the government’s evidence below, we\nconclude that a reasonable jury could find that the Defendant actually\nknew of, or was willfully blind to, the involvement of the U.S. entity\nin the transactions conducted in 1994-1996.26 Such a conclusion\nwould by itself support a conviction for conspiracy, as it is not\nnecessary for the government to prove anything related to the latter\n\n\nCanada and in the United Kingdom to halt all such transactions in\ndeference to the United States embargo.” Brief of Appellee at 12. As\nexplained above, we do not review any evidence in the defense case\nin assessing the propriety of the judgment of acquittal. However, we\ntake note of this footnote and of the fact (revealed to us by the\ngovernment) that the Brodies and The Bro-Tech Corporation have\npending a legal malpractice action against Morgan, Lewis & Bockius\nLLP, to stress that we appreciate the broad context of this case, but do\nnot deem it relevant to the present decision.\n        26\n         The District Court also recognized that the evidence\n“establishe[d] that [the Defendant] did know that it was illegal for the\nU.S. company to be involved in sales to Cuba.” 268 F. Supp. 2d at\n417. The District Court further reasoned that “[i]f there were\nevidence ... that [the Defendant] knew about the involvement of the\nU.S. company in some of the sales from 1994 through 1996, the\nCourt will assume that a rational jury could find that he knowingly\nand willfully joined the conspiracy.” Id. at 417. The District Court\nfound insufficient evidence to support the inference of such\nknowledge; examining the same evidence, however, we find it\nsufficient to support that critical inference.\n\n                                  53\n\ftime period. However, we also conclude that a reasonable juror could\nconclude on the evidence that the Defendant knew or was willfully\nblind to the fact that the U.S. entity was still involved (albeit to a\nmuch lesser degree) in the transactions that occurred in the latter time\nframe.27 We now explore how these conclusions may be reached on\nthe evidence as a whole.\n\n        C.      The Evidence as a Whole\n\n        We will by necessity segregate our discussion in terms of the\nsix key pieces of evidence identified above, but one should not miss\nthe forest for the trees. The inferences against the Defendant urged\nby the government depend for their reasonableness on viewing the\nevidence as a whole, and while the Defendant disputes the existence\nof nearly every tree, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant did conspire to violate\nthe American Cuban embargo.\n\n        1.      Basic company structure\n\n        We begin with the evidence related to the basic structure of\nThe Bro-Tech Corporation d/b/a/ The Purolite Company, not because\nit was the most critical, but because a rational jury could legitimately\nuse it as a prism through which to assess all of the other\ncircumstantial evidence presented against the Defendant in this case.\n\n        27\n          Additionally, although the government urges the inference\nthat the Defendant actually knew of the participation of the U.S.\nentity in the transactions conducted by the U.K. entity and we find\nthat inference reasonable, we believe that a rational jury might also\nconclude from the evidence as a whole that the Defendant’s actions\nbelie a good faith belief in the legality of the “trading though the U.K.\nis ok” policy which he espoused as the basis for his defense.\n\n                                   54\n\fWe believe, moreover, that this evidence is particularly revealing\nwhen considered under the willful blindness instruction given by the\nDistrict Court.\n\n         From the facts related to the basic company structure, the\ngovernment urged an inference that the Defendant, as President of\nThe Bro-Tech Corporation, knew that the sales involving Cuba were\noccurring and critically, that they involved the U.S. entity, or was at\nthe very least willfully blind to that fact. The District Court was\n“very reluctant in a criminal conspiracy case, where the required\nmental state is knowledge and willfulness, to give any weight to these\npoints,” 268 F. Supp. 2d at 420, and moreover, took explicit note of\ntestimony elicited on cross-examination that, during the period of the\ncharged conspiracy, the Defendant “spent 70-80% of his time out of\nthe country opening plants in Romania and China.” Id. We\nconclude, however, that the District Court usurped the role of the jury\nin its handling of this evidence.\n\n         In our view, it would be reasonable for a jury to give weight\n– indeed, substantial weight – to the fact that the Defendant was the\nPresident of The Bro-Tech Corporation; this, in turn, would support\nthe critical inference that he knew of the sales to Cuba and of the U.S.\nentity’s involvement therein. This inference is only strengthened\nwhen other basic facts pertaining to the corporate structure are added\ninto the mix. While The Bro-Tech Corporation had offices and\noperations in various parts of the world, it was not a large company\nas evidenced by the fact that its main office was housed on one floor\nof a suburban Pennsylvania office building and that the men most\nintimately involved in the prohibited sales – Don Brodie and later,\nMr. Sabzali – had their offices in that building in close proximity to\nthe Defendant’s office. The illegal sales to Cuba, moreover, which\ngrossed approximately $2.1 million, were not so minuscule as to\nreasonably escape the notice of the company’s president. Finally, the\n\n\n                                  55\n\ftestimony tended to paint the Defendant as an active participant in\ncompany affairs, not as a corporate figurehead whom a jury might\nmore readily infer was ignorant of the actions of his fellow officers\nand subordinates.\n\n         A rational jury, moreover, could legitimately consider the\nrelationship between the Brodies in drawing reasonable inferences\nabout the Defendant’s knowledge and intent. While guilt for\nconspiracy cannot be proven solely by familial relationships, see e.g.,\nUnited States v. Williams-Hendricks, 805 F.2d 496, 502-503 (5th Cir.\n1986), it is not the bare fact of kinship that drives the inference\nsought by the government in this case, but rather the additional facts\nthat the brothers owned the entities involved, were active participants\nin company affairs, and appear to have communicated with one\nanother on business-related issues, including Mr. Sabzali’s\npromotion. There is no proscription against a jury considering and\ndrawing reasonable adverse inferences from such facts. See United\nStates v. Warshawsky, 20 F.3d 204, 209 n.2 (6th Cir. 1994) (noting\nin context of prosecution for conspiracy to transport stolen parts that\n“the jury could properly consider the fact that the defendants were\nboth brothers and business partners, which raises a permissible\ninference that they might share information concerning their business\nactivities”); United States v. Investment Enterprises, Inc., 10 F.3d\n263, 267 n.4 (5th Cir. 1993) (noting in context of prosecution of\ncompany president for interstate transportation of obscene materials\nthat “[c]lose relationships can be part of the circumstantial evidence\nfrom which a jury may infer that the defendant knew of a\nconspiracy”); see also United States v. Loscalzo, 18 F.3d 374, 382\n(7th Cir. 1994) (rejecting corporate president’s effort to paint his\nparticipation in context of conviction for conspiracy to defraud the\nUnited States and mail fraud as that of the “ignorant partner” where\nevidence showed his financial benefit from the problematic\narrangement and his overall position of responsibility).\n\n\n                                  56\n\f         As was the case with various testimony elicited on cross-\nexamination of the government’s witnesses, the testimony concerning\nthe Defendant’s lengthy absences from the Bala Cynwyd office while\npursuing business elsewhere may be said to weaken the inference of\nknowledge or willful blindness to the participation of the U.S. entity,\nbut it does not completely erase that inference or render it\nunreasonable. Given the fact that this same evidence portrays the\nDefendant as an active participant in his company’s affairs (he was,\nafter all, out of the office actively pursuing business on behalf of his\ncompany), a juror might reasonably infer that he was not completely\ndisconnected from events concerning his company, even while\nphysically absent from his office. The weight and relevance of such\nevidence is to be assessed by the jury; it is not to be deemed of\noverriding importance by the court.\n\n       2.      The billing instruction, audit and related events\n\n        The government and the defense each had their own theory as\nto what the series of events concerning the 1992 Galax transaction\nand the audit revealed about the state of the Defendant’s knowledge\nof the illegality of the sales to Cuba and of the U.S. entity’s\ninvolvement therein. The basic thrust of the government’s theory was\nthat, as revealed by the billing instruction, the Defendant already\nknew about the 1992 Galax transaction before it was brought to his\nattention by the auditors and that his actions related to the billing\ninstruction and the audit in the period of 1992 and 1993 reveal two\nthings: one, that he was attempting to conceal his knowledge of any\nand all Cuba-related transactions that had already occurred and of the\nU.S. entity’s involvement therein, and two, that he expected and\nintended future transactions to occur. This global inference is tied to\na series of interconnected supporting inferences, each of which we\nbelieve a rational jury could make on the evidence presented.\n\n\n\n                                  57\n\f         The first major supporting inference is tied to the billing\ninstruction. The District Court, noting that Mr. Grossman testified\nthat the billing instruction was given before the events of the audit,\nconcluded that a “permissible inference from [Mr. Grossman’s]\ntestimony is that [the Defendant] gave the instructions he did to Mr.\nGrossman to conceal sales to Cuba.” 268 F. Supp. 2d at 418. We\nagree, and further believe that a rational jury who concludes that the\nbilling instruction was given in 1992 could also infer therefrom that\nthe Defendant desired those sales to continue. In our view, a rational\njury viewing the evidence as a whole could conclude that it was this\naction by the Defendant which dictated how sales to Cuba were\nhandled by the company in the 1994-1996 time-frame before the\ninvestigation began. At the very least this evidence suggests that the\nDefendant was willfully blind to the actions of the U.S. entity in the\n1994-1996 period.\n\n        The second major supporting inference is tied to the events\nconcerning the audit. While the District Court did not specifically\nexplain why it rejected the government’s inferences from this\nevidence, we conclude that it must have done so and did so\nimproperly. A rational jury, especially one that has already indulged\na negative inference against the Defendant in relation to the 1992\nbilling instruction, could infer that the Defendant (1) feigned\nignorance to the auditor who discovered the Galax sale in 1993; (2)\ndeliberately characterized Mr. Sabzali as a new employee (when he\nknew differently28) and initially resisted the need for a legal opinion\n\n       28\n          The District Court, finding “no evidence that Mr. Sabzali\nhad been with the company since 1990,” emphatically rejected any\ninference that the Defendant lied or somehow misrepresented the\ntruth to the auditors in 1993 when he characterized Mr. Sabzali as a\n“new” employee. See 268 F. Supp. 2d at 418 n.6. Such evidence is\nin the record however. Mr. Grossman testified on direct examination\n\n                                  58\n\fon the effect of the Galax transaction, both in an effort to downplay\nthe significance of the transaction; and (3) fired the auditors who\ndiscovered the Galax transaction, not out of dissatisfaction with their\nservices, but rather because of their knowledge of that transaction. A\njury that has indulged these reasonable inferences could also infer that\nthe Defendant knew the U.S. entity was violating the law and was\ntaking steps to ensure that future transactions would go unquestioned.\n\n        The third major supporting inference is tied to the future\npolicy memorandum, which purported to set forth company policy\nregarding future sales to Cuba. This document was key to the both\nsides’ theory of the case. The government urged one of two\ncharacterizations – either the document was a “sham” in that it was\n\n\nthat, by the time Mr. Grossman began his employment with the\ncompany in January 1991, Mr. Sabzali was already working in the\nCanada office. Additionally, the following exchange occurred during\nthe cross-examination of Ms. Graves:\n\n       Q:      ... From about 1990 until 1996, Mr. Sabzali\n               was the sales manager at the Purolite Canada\n               office, is that correct?\n\n       A:      Yes.\n\nA. 906 (Graves, cross-examination). If a jury found on the basis of\nthis evidence that Mr. Sabzali had been with the company since at\nleast 1990, it would be no leap to infer that the Defendant, as an\nactive participant in company affairs, knew that Mr. Sabzali was not\na “new” employee but deliberately characterized him as such to\ndownplay the significance of the uncovered Galax transaction (in\nother words, to perhaps insinuate that Mr. Sabzali did not know any\nbetter and the illegal transaction would not reoccur).\n\n                                  59\n\fshown to the auditors but not actually issued to the salesman, or it\nwas “window-dressing” – i.e., a policy statement to which the\ncompany could point while simultaneously engaging in transactions\nwith Cuba with the participation of the U.S. entity. The defense, on\nthe other hand, pointed to the future policy memorandum as setting\nforth the Defendant’s good-faith belief that the U.K. entity could\ntrade with Cuba so long as the U.S. entity was not involved, and as\nevidence that, far from violating the law, he was trying to abide by\nit.29 The District Court rejected the sham characterization, see 268 F.\nSupp. 2d at 418, and we agree there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport it. The District Court also rejected the window-dressing\ncharacterization, and it is here that we part company.\n\n        Attempting to understand the testimony related to the 1992\nbilling instruction in light of the future policy memorandum, the\n\n       29\n          We believe that the text of the future policy memorandum\nreasonably could be viewed by a jury as refuting the Defendant’s\nclaim that he did not know it was illegal to ship Purolite product from\nthe U.K. entity. It provides, in pertinent part: “While it is proper to\nship this order from the UK in terms of UK law, it is contrary to USA\npolicy and law to ship material of any kind to the island nation of\nCuba in violation of the US embargo. ... No shipment of Purolite\nmerchandise is to be shipped to, redirected to, or trans-shipped to\nCuba.”(emphasis added). The term “transship” means “to transfer for\nfurther transportation from one ship or conveyance to another.”\nWEBSTER ’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (G. & C.\nMerriam Co. 1981). One could infer that shipments of Purolite\nproduct, to the extent they were physically shipped from the U.K.\nentity but otherwise handled in some manner by the U.S. entity (i.e.,\nthrough sales, processing, etc.), were “transshipped” and hence under\nthe proscription of both the future policy memorandum and the\nAmerican Cuban embargo.\n\n                                  60\n\fDistrict Court appears to have viewed the latter as establishing a “new\npolicy with respect to Cuba” – i.e., one that would counteract the\n1992 billing instruction. 268 F. Supp. 2d at 418. Further, the District\nCourt concluded there was “simply no evidence to support” the\nwindow-dressing characterization, and that “[t]he fact that during the\nperiod 1994 through 1996, there were sales to Cuba that at times\ninvolved the United States is not evidence that the [D]efendant\nintended the memorandum as a cover when there is not other\nevidence that he knew about the sales. Nor was there any evidence\nthat [the Defendant] or anyone else followed up the memorandum\nwith either written or oral instructions that it was to be ignored.” Id.\nIn our view, however, a rational jury viewing the evidence as a whole\ncould draw the inference that the future policy memorandum was\nwindow dressing.\n\n        The window dressing inference depends for its reasonableness\non all of the evidence put forth by the government in its case against\nthe Defendant. It is not a strong inference, but a jury that has\nindulged adverse inferences against the Defendant related to the basic\nfacts of the company, the billing instruction and the events of the\naudit (as well as from the “our friends in the Caribbean speech,” the\nSabzali performance review, the use of code words, and the post-\ninvestigation events, all of which we examine below), it would not be\nunreasonable to further infer that the future policy memorandum was\nintended to put a public face on a behind-the-scenes agreement by the\nprincipal actors to pursue sales to Cuba in violation of a known\nprohibition. While the District Court placed significant emphasis on\nMr. Grossman’s cross-examination testimony, such presented\nGrossman’s understanding of the future policy memorandum; it\nwould be up to the jury to square his testimony with all of the other\nevidence in determining if Grossman’s understanding could be said\nto reflect the Defendant’s intent. To our mind, there are a number of\nways to read Mr. Grossman’s testimony; to conclude that it may be\n\n\n                                  61\n\fread only to negate a finding of intent by the Defendant is to overstep\nthe judicial role. The court’s obligation in the context of\nFed.R.Crim.P. 29 is to ensure that any inferences arising from\ncircumstantial evidence are reasonable, and we believe the window\ndressing inference is that.\n\n       3.      The “Our friends in the Caribbean” speech\n\n        Each side urged a different inference from the incident in\nwhich Mr. Sabzali, following a whispered comment by the Defendant\nduring a sales presentation, substituted a reference to “the Caribbean”\nin place of his previous reference to Cuba. The government offered\nthis evidence to show the Defendant engaged in an act of concealment\nfrom which one could infer guilty knowledge. The defense countered\nthat any adverse inferences were unreasonable given the uncertainly\nas to what the Defendant said to Mr. Sabzali and when the incident\noccurred. Instead, the defense urged an inference that the event, if it\noccurred in 1993 (i.e., after the issuance of the future policy\nmemorandum), merely showed the Defendant trying to comply with\nthe law as he understood it and had directed it be followed in the\nfuture policy memorandum. The District Court rejected the\ninferences favored by either side as illogical, and moreover, deemed\nthem both speculative due to the uncertainty of the Defendant’s\nstatement, his motive in speaking to Mr. Sabzali, and the date of the\nincident. 268 F. Supp. 2d at 419.\n\n        The District Court’s handling of this circumstantial evidence,\nwhich we believe a rational jury could view as particularly strong\nagainst the Defendant, again invaded the province of the jury. While\none does not know exactly what the Defendant said to Mr. Sabzali,\na rational jury could reasonably infer the content of that statement\nbased on the reaction of both men. A rational jury viewing the\nevidence as a whole could also draw a reasonable adverse inference\n\n\n                                  62\n\fas to the Defendant’s motive in speaking to his subordinate. Such\ninferences are not merely speculative, but have a logical and\nconvincing connection.\n\n         Additionally, the weight and value of this evidence should not\nhave been discounted due to uncertainty over when the incident\noccurred. A rational juror, by choosing to believe Mr. Gentile’s\ntestimony as given at trial or as given before the grand jury (and\nreferenced during cross-examination at trial), could have accepted\nthat this event occurred in 1992 before the audit and related events or\nin 1993 after the issuance of the future policy memorandum.\nCritically, we believe that an inference of concealment would be\nreasonable in conjunction with either date when put in the context of\nthe evidence as a whole. Furthermore, the inference of concealment\nbecomes even more reasonable when Mr. Sabzali’s use of\n“Caribbean” during this incident – as apparently prompted by the\nDefendant30 – is considered in light of the fact that many other\nemployees of The Bro-Tech Company, at the time of the speech or\nlater, understood “Caribbean” to be a code word for Cuba.\n\n        4.      Mr. Sabzali’s performance review\n\n        The government urged a number of related inferences from\nthe evidence of Mr. Sabzali’s performance review and promotion –\nmainly, that the Defendant was aware of and approved of Mr.\nSabzali’s sales to Cuba, wanted to reward him for those sales, and\n\n        30\n          We are not ourselves usurping the jury’s role by insinuating\nthat the Defendant actually told Mr. Sabzali during the whispered\nconversation to use the term Caribbean; we are merely suggesting that\na rational juror could so infer or at least infer that the Defendant said\nsomething less direct but equally meaningful to Mr. Sabzali, who then\nhimself chose the term Caribbean.\n\n                                   63\n\fwanted such sales to continue as evidenced by the fact that, despite\nbeing promoted to a marketing position, Mr. Sabzali was to continue\nhandling “the Caribbean sales.” The defense pointed to testimony in\nthe government’s case tending to undercut the reasonableness of such\ninferences – mainly, that Don Brodie, not the Defendant, was in\ncharge of North American affairs, thus making it more reasonable to\ninfer that Don alone was responsible for Mr. Sabzali’s promotion, and\nthat Mr. Opperman was promoted by the Defendant to an\ninternational position, thus making it unreasonable to infer that the\nDefendant had a hand in a North American-related promotion like\nMr. Sabzali’s. In ruling on the motion for acquittal, the District Court\nacknowledged that a rational juror could conclude that the reference\nto “Caribbean” in the performance review meant Cuba, and that the\nDefendant read the performance review, saw the reference and knew\ntherefrom that The Bro-Tech Corporation was selling product to\nCuba. 268 F. Supp. 2d at 419. However, the District Court rejected\nany inference that the Defendant also knew, as a result, that the U.S.\nentity (as opposed to solely the U.K. entity) was actually involved in\nthose sales. See id.\n\n        We agree that the evidence related to Mr. Sabzali’s\nperformance review would support the inferences identified by the\nDistrict Court, but believe there are additional ones that might be\ndrawn by a rational jury from the evidence as a whole. Specifically,\nwe believe a jury could reasonably infer that the Defendant not only\nread the performance review, but approved of the underlying\npromotion, knew it was based on Mr. Sabzali’s success in transacting\nbusiness with Cuba, and intended to reward and thereby incentivize\nsuch sales in the future. We further part company with the District\nCourt in terms of what this evidence may suggest about the\nDefendant’s knowledge of the involvement of the U.S. entity in such\nsales. As all the evidence suggests that Mr. Sabzali was a star\nsalesman in “the Caribbean,” it would be not be an impermissible\n\n\n                                  64\n\fleap to infer that an involved president of the company would know\nwhy that was so and how it was occurring.\n\n        5.      Use of code words\n\n         The government evidence shows a corporate culture pervaded\nby the use of code words for Cuba, and such naturally gives rise to an\ninference of concealment. See Macko, 994 F.2d at 1535 (“The one\naspect of the operation that they kept secret was the Cuban\nconnection. A jury could reasonably conclude that the defendants’\nsecrecy about this single fact resulted from their knowledge of the\nCuban embargo”). Importantly, the use of code words was attributed\nat least twice to the Defendant. First, in issuing the billing instruction\nto Mr. Grossman (whether that occurred in 1992 or 1993, after or in\nconjunction with the events of the audit), the Defendant asked Mr.\nGrossman to instruct the billing department not to include any\nreference to Cuba on the face of future invoices, and that instruction\nwas given. A jury could reasonable conclude that this instruction\neither instigated or at least contributed to an overall corporate culture\nof deceit concerning transactions with Cuba. Second, it was the\nDefendant whose actions before a room of subordinate salesmen\nappear to have prompted Mr. Sabzali to refer to “Caribbean” instead\nof to Cuba. Again, we believe that a rational jury could conclude that\nthe Defendant’s reaction to Mr. Sabzali’s use of the word Cuba either\ninstigated or at least attributed to the overall corporate culture of\ndeceit. Both were actions of the company’s president, not some low-\nlevel employee whose behavior might be less influential. The use of\ncode words, when viewed in conjunction with the other evidence in\nthis case, tends to strengthen the overall inference that the Defendant\nwas a knowing and willful participant in the conspiracy to trade with\nCuba and understood that the U.S. entity was involved.\n\n\n\n\n                                   65\n\f        In an attempt to undermine the rationality of any adverse\ninference from the use of code words, the defense pointed to the fact\nthat there was, simultaneously, rather open use of “Cuba” or\n“Havana” in company memorandum, sales documents and expense\nreports. There was also testimony elicited on cross-examination from\na former product manager for The Purolite Company to the effect that\nhe asked Mr. Sabzali not to use the word Cuba on anything sent to\nhim. Finally, there was testimony from Mr. Grossman that The Bro-\nTech Corporation had other customers in the Caribbean, although he\ncould only recall one. Again, this evidence does tend to weaken the\ninference of concealment, but critically, does not render it completely\nunreasonable. The weight to be assigned the use of code words in\nthis prosecution on circumstantial evidence is for the jury.\n\n       6.      Post-investigation events\n\n        The government urged that the Sabzali memorandum of\nFebruary 28, 1997, showed that transactions involving Cuba\nconducted before the Customs agents’ visit a few weeks prior\ninvolved the U.S. entity. In other words, there would be no need to\nexplain in that memorandum “we now have to ship products from\nU.K.” if such had already been the procedure. Similarly, there would\nbe no need to explain that invoicing to the “customer in the\nCaribbean” would now be done directly “from Ponty” unless prior\nprocedure had involved the U.S. entity. This memo was not carbon\ncopied to the Defendant, but the government contended that a\nreasonable juror viewing the evidence as a whole could infer the\nDefendant’s knowledge of its underlying premise (i.e., that sales\nbefore the investigation were conducted with the participation of the\nU.S. entity). From the fact that the Defendant was carbon-copied on\nMr. Sabzali’s February 28, 1997 and March 3, 1997 memoranda, the\ngovernment urged an inference that the Defendant read these\ndocuments and thereby knew of the continued participation of the\n\n\n                                  66\n\fU.S. entity in the sales occurring in early 1997 from the fact that Mr.\nSabzali was now directing sales in “the Caribbean” from his office in\nBala Cynwyd. The participation of the U.S. entity was certainly less\n(or at least on the decline) at this point, but as evidenced by these\nmemoranda, still involved the U.S. entity’s Bala Cynwyd office. The\nDistrict Court never addressed whether any reasonable inferences\nagainst the Defendant arise from this evidence, having merely noted\nin a footnote the existence of the two memoranda carbon copied to\nthe Defendant. Again, however, we believe that a rational jury\nviewing the evidence as a whole could use them to draw adverse\ninferences against the Defendant.\n\n        From the evidence of the Defendant’s phone call to Ms.\nGraves, the government urged an inference of concealment and\ntherefore of knowledge of past wrongdoing. The defense sought to\nundercut any adverse inference by noting a lack of evidence to\nsuggest that the Defendant knew Ms. Graves would be interviewed\nby the government again and by urging that the critical statement – “if\nyou can’t remember the name, then you don’t have anything to tell\nthem” – be taken at face value as merely an innocent observation. In\nruling on the motion, the District Court acknowledged that the\ngovernment’s inference as to the call to Ms. Graves was a “fair one,”\nbut ultimately assigned it no value, reasoning: “[This] inference does\nnot shed any light on whether the defendant knew about the 1994 to\n1996 shipments before or at the time they were occurring. This\nconversation took place two years after the government had started its\ninvestigation. [The Defendant] surely would have known about the\nshipments at that point ...” 268 F. Supp. 2d at 419. We agree that an\ninference of concealment is reasonable and further conclude that a\nrational jury viewing the evidence as a whole could further infer, as\nthe impetus for the act of calling Ms. Graves, that the Defendant\nknew of the illegal sales activity during the relevant time frame. It is\njust as reasonable (if not more so) to infer that the Defendant was\n\n\n                                  67\n\fseeking to conceal illegal activity involving the U.S. entity that\npredated the investigation of which he knew at the time he called Ms.\nGraves than it is to conclude he was seeking to conceal acts which he\nnow understood to have been illegal. The mere fact that he chose to\ncontact Ms. Graves in 1999 – a woman who, by virtue of her former\nposition as a customer sales representative processing orders, might\nhave seen orders involving transactions with Cuba – is itself\nimportant. Moreover, a rational jury viewing the evidence as a whole\ncould certainly decline to interpret the Defendant’s advice to Ms.\nGraves as benign, and instead view it as another instance of the\nDefendant attempting to conceal the Cuban transactions.\n\n         The government also urged an inference of concealment from\nthe Defendant’s reaction to Mr. Lugo’s visit to the U.S. embassy.\nThe District Court stated unequivocally that “a rational juror could\nnot make a negative inference here” because “[t]he defendant was\ntelling an employee to let him know if he is called in again to the U.S.\nEmbassy because of a concern ‘that U.S. officials would be asking\n[Lugo] questions without company counsel present.’” 268 F. Supp.\n2d at 419-20 (emphasis added, brackets in the original). See also id.\nat 420 (“The Lugo discussion adds very little, if anything, to the\ngovernment’s case.”). We acknowledge the uncertainty on the record\nabout the timing of Mr. Lugo’s visit to the embassy and whether the\nDefendant relayed his reaction thereto directly to Mr. Lugo, or\nthrough Mr. Sabzali. For present purposes, however, it is the reaction\nitself, coming sometime after the investigation was underway and\npresumably known to the Defendant, that is the key to the inference\nof concealment. A rational jury viewing the evidence as a whole need\nnot have accepted the Defendant’s explanation that the instruction to\nMr. Lugo was borne solely of a concern with having counsel present.\nInstead, one could reasonably conclude that, like the veiled\ninstruction given to Ms. Graves, the instruction to Mr. Lugo was\nmotivated by a desire to conceal past wrongdoing.\n\n\n                                  68\n\f       D.      Willful Blindness\n\n         As explained above, we are satisfied that a reasonable jury\ncould conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant had\nactual knowledge of the law violated, the facts constituting the\noffense and the illicit purpose of the conspiracy. We also conclude\nthat a reasonable jury could find the knowledge requirements of the\ncrime met on a theory of willful blindness. Overall, the government’s\nevidence paints a convincing picture of the Defendant as a company\npresident who deliberately stuck his head in the sand regarding the\ninvolvement of the U.S. entity in the prohibited transactions. In\nparticular, the evidence related to the billing instruction could be\nviewed as the Defendant trying to ensure that he never saw a direct\nreference to Cuba again, despite intending the transactions to\ncontinue. The corporate culture wherein Cuba was referred to by\n“code words,” which a reasonable jury could attribute at least in part\nto the conduct of the Defendant, only aided him in his effort to ignore\nwhat should have been obvious. And while the Defendant repeatedly\nargues that the future policy memorandum and the events of the audit\nshow him trying to discern and comply with the law, a jury might\nreasonably take note of the Defendant’s failure to ask the “natural\nfollow-up question[s]” when, for example, he did not question the\nreference to “Caribbean” on Mr. Sabzali’s performance review, and\nnever instigated any follow-up to the events of the 1992 audit report\n(as he suggested to Mr. Coulter that he would) or to his own\ninstruction in the future policy memorandum, to ensure that his\ncompany was not transacting business with SDNs or with Cuba. See\nWert-Ruiz, 228 F.3d at 257 (stating, in context of conviction for\nmoney laundering, that “the fact that [defendant] did not ask the\nnatural follow-up question to determine the source of those funds\ncould be reasonably considered by a jury to be evidence of willful\nblindness, especially when combined with the additional evidence”).\nThe basic facts of the company structure also strengthen the willful\n\n\n                                  69\n\fblindness inference in that it would not be unreasonable for a jury to\ninfer that the Defendant was motivated to deliberately avoid learning\nthe facts related to his company’s trade with Cuba due to its\nprofitability or his brother’s involvement. As in Stewart, where this\nCourt concluded that a jury could have found that a defendant former\nlaw partner, who argued that he lacked the intent to defraud since he\nrelied on solvency findings by third-party investigators, “could have\nrecognized the likelihood of insolvency yet deliberately avoided\nlearning the true facts,” 185 F.3d 126, we conclude that the Defendant\nin this case could have recognized the likelihood that the U.S. entity\nwas involved in illegal transactions with Cuba “yet deliberately\navoided learning the true facts.”\n\n                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal in a conspiracy\ncase built entirely on circumstantial evidence is not an easy task, and\nwas made all the more difficult in this case by the complexities of the\nunderlying substantive law and voluminous record. Nonetheless, we\nconclude that because each of the interconnected inferences urged by\nthe government is reasonable on the evidence as a whole, the District\nCourt erred in entering the judgment of acquittal, and accordingly we\n\n\n\n\n                                  70\n\fwill vacate that judgment and reinstate the jury verdict subject to the\nDistrict Court’s conditional grant of a new trial.31\n\n\n\n\n        31\n          Where a defendant has been acquitted on the ground of\ninsufficient evidence to support the conviction, and this Court vacates\nthe judgment of acquittal, the proper procedure is to reinstate the jury\nverdict. See Coleman, 811 F.2d at 805; United States v. Dixon, 658\nF.2d 181 (3d Cir. 1981). We do so here, although we recognize that\nthe District Court has already granted the Defendant a new trial\npending the outcome of this appeal. If the Defendant is retried\nfollowing our reinstatement of the verdict, “it will be the result of his\nown motion for a new trial, and not a process imposed upon him by\nthe Government or this court,” Dixon, 658 F.2d at 187, and thus there\nwill be no issue of double jeopardy.\n\n                                   71\n\f",

Brodie was found guilty by a jury of\nconspiring to trade with Cuba in violation of the American Cuban\nembargo currently in place under the provisions of the Trading with\nthe Enemy Act of 1917 (“TWEA”) and the Cuban Assets Control\nRegulations (“CACRs”). The United States District Court for the\nEastern District of Pennsylvania, ruling on a previously reserved\nmotion for judgment of acquittal, thereafter acquitted the Defendant\non the ground that there was insufficient evidence of his knowing and\nwillful participation in the charged conspiracy to support conviction.\nUnited States v.

After\nreviewing the government’s evidence against the Defendant, we\nconclude that the District Court erred in entering the judgment of\nacquittal, and accordingly, we vacate the judgment, reinstate the jury\nverdict, and remand for further proceedings which may, on the\npresent record, include a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                  2\n\f                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      The American Cuban Embargo\n\n        The backdrop for this appeal is the American Cuban embargo\nagainst trading with Cuba which derives in the first instance from the\nTWEA, 50 U.S.C. App. § 1 et. seq. The TWEA as originally enacted\ndealt only with the President’s use of economic powers in times of\nwar, but was expanded in 1933 to deal with national emergencies that\narose during peacetime. See Regan v. Wald, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111243\"><a href=\"/opinion/111243/regan-v-wald/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 n.2\n(1984). Section 5(b) of the TWEA, in pertinent part, authorizes the\nPresident, through a designated agency, to “investigate, regulate, ...\nor prohibit ... transactions involving, any property in which any\nforeign country or a national thereof has any interest, by any person,\nor with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the\nUnited States.” 50 U.S.C. App. § 5(b)(1)(B).1 Section 16, in turn,\ncriminalizes willful violation of any “order of the President issued in\ncompliance with the provisions of th[e TWEA].” 50 U.S.C.App.\n\n       1\n         TWEA Section 5(b) was amended in 1977 to limit the\nPresident’s authority once again to times of war, but the same law\ncontaining that limitation (i.e., The International Emergency\nEconomic Powers Act (“IEEPA”)) also grand-fathered existing\nexercises of the President’s national emergency authority (including\nthe American Cuban embargo) and permitted the President to extend\ntheir exercise in one year intervals where in the national interest. The\nCuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (popularly known as\nLIBERTAD), enacted in 1996, continued the Cuban embargo\nindefinitely and effectively suspended the IEEPA’s requirement that\nthe President revisit the basis for the American Cuban embargo each\nyear. See 22 U.S.C. §§ 6021-6091; see also United States v.\nPlummer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1298</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1307-1308 & n.6 (11th Cir. 2000)\n(reviewing this history).\n\n                                   3\n\f§ 16. Presidential authority under the TWEA has been delegated to\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, who has in turn delegated that authority\nto the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). See Regan, 468\nU.S. at 226 n.2 (citing Exec. Order No. 9193, 3 C.F.R. 1174, 1175\n(1942) and Treasury Department Order No. 128 (Rev. 1, Oct. 15,\n1962)). In 1963, the CACRs were promulgated pursuant to TWEA\nSection 5(b) to impose an embargo against Cuba in an effort “to deal\nwith the peacetime emergency created by Cuban attempts to\ndestabilize governments throughout Latin America.” Regan, 468\nU.S. at 226. The CACRs incorporated and expanded upon prior\neconomic sanctions already imposed against Cuba. See id. at 226 &\nn.4.\n\n       Of particular importance to this appeal is CACR § 515.201(b)\nwhich provides:\n\n       (b)       All of the following transactions are\n                 prohibited except as specifically authorized by\n                 the Secretary of the Treasury (or any person,\n                 agency, or instrumentality designated by him)\n                 by means of regulations, rulings, instructions,\n                 licenses, or otherwise, if such transactions\n                 involve property in which any foreign country\n                 designated under this part,[2] or any national\n\n       2\n           CACR § 515.201(d) provides:\n\n       For the purposes of this part, the term ‘foreign country\n       designated under this part’ and the term ‘designated\n       foreign country’ mean Cuba and the term ‘effective\n       date’ and the term ‘effective date of this section’ mean\n       with respect to Cuba, or any national thereof, 12:01\n       a.m., e.s.t., July 8, 1963.\n\n                                   4\n\f               thereof, has at any time on or since the\n               effective date of this section had any interest\n               of any nature whatsoever, direct or indirect:\n\n               (1) All dealings in, including, without\n               limitation, transfers, withdrawals, or\n               exportations of, any property or evidences of\n               indebtedness or evidences of ownership of\n               property by any person subject to the\n               jurisdiction of the United States; and\n\n               (2) All transfers outside the United States with\n               regard to any property or property interest\n               subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\n\nSee 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b) (2005); see also 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b)\n(1992); 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b) (1993); 31 C.F.R. § 515.201(b)\n(2000). As CACR § 515.201(b) suggests, business transactions\ninvolving Cuba may be specifically authorized by OFAC; here,\nhowever, it is uncontested that no such authorization was ever\nobtained for the business transactions that gave rise to the underlying\nprosecution.\n\n       The phrase “person subject to the jurisdiction of the United\nStates” as used in CACR § 515.201(b) is defined in CACR\n§ 515.329, 31 C.F.R. § 515.329, which provided, at the time the\nconspiracy charged in this case was allegedly in effect:\n\n\n\n\n31 C.F.R. § 515.201(d) (2005).\n\n                                  5\n\f       The term ‘person subject to the jurisdiction of the\n       United States’ includes:\n\n       (a) Any individual, wherever located, who is a citizen\n       or resident of the United States;\n\n       (b) Any person within the United States as defined in\n       § 515.330;\n\n       (c) Any corporation organized under the laws of the\n       United States or of any State, territory, possession, or\n       district of the United States; and\n\n       (d) Any corporation, partnership, or association,\n       wherever organized or doing business, that is owned\n       or controlled by persons specified in paragraphs (a) or\n       (c) of this section.\n\n31 C.F.R. § 515.329 (1993) (emphasis added); see also 31 C.F.R.\n§ 515.329 (2000); 50 Fed. Reg. 27435 (July 3, 1985).3 The critical\n\n       3\n        Effective March 24, 2003, CACR § 515.329 was revised to\nprovide:\n\n       (c) Any corporation, partnership, association, or\n       other organization organized under the laws of the\n       United States or of any State, territory, possession, or\n       district of the United States; and\n       (d) Any corporation, partnership, association, or other\n       organization, wherever organized or doing business,\n       that is owned or controlled by persons specified in\n       paragraphs (a) or (c) of this section.\n\n\n                                  6\n\fphrase “owned or controlled” in CACR § 515.329(d) is not defined\nin the CACRs, but notably, the CACRs have included a broad\n“person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States” feature from\ntheir inception.

The Indictment\n\n        The Defendant Stefan E. Brodie and his brother Donald B.\nBrodie (“Don Brodie”) were co-owners of The Bro-Tech Corporation,\nan entity incorporated in Delaware, which manufactured and sold ion\nexchange resins for industrial use in water purification under the trade\nname “The Purolite Company.” The Bro-Tech Corporation was\nheadquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, and had a\nmanufacturing plant and warehouse facility located in Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania. The Defendant was the president of The Bro-Tech\nCorporation; his brother Don Brodie was the vice-president. Purolite\nproduct was sold by salesmen operating from sales offices located\nthroughout North America, including one in Ontario, Canada\n(“Purolite Canada”) from which James E. Sabzali (“Mr. Sabzali”), a\nCanadian citizen, worked from approximately 1990 to 1995 until\npromoted to a marketing position based in the Bala Cynwyd office.\n\n      The Defendant, Don Brodie and The Bro-Tech Corporation\nowned, in approximately 1/3 shares, another corporation known as\n\n        6\n         The American Cuban embargo’s purported extraterritorial\nreach has been criticized by numerous commentators.

Purolite International Limited (alternatively called “the\nU.K. entity” herein to differentiate it from “The Purolite Company”\nor the “U.S. entity”) had its own board of directors, sales people, and\nfinance department. The Brodie brothers, however, ultimately owned\nand controlled the U.K. entities as well as the U.S. entities.\n\n        In late 1996-early 1997, the United States Customs Service\n(which investigates illegal exports on behalf of OFAC) received\ninformation leading it to suspect that The Purolite Company was\ntrading in violation of the American Cuban embargo. Customs agents\nthereafter met with a Purolite official at the Bala Cynwyd office on\nFebruary 5, 1997, and, following some initial exchange of documents\nbetween the agents and the company, a prosecutor was assigned and\ngrand jury subpoenas were issued to the company. On October 5,\n2000, a grand jury indicted the Defendant, Don Brodie, The Bro-Tech\nCorporation d/b/a/ “The Purolite Company,” and Mr. Sabzali on a\nsingle count of conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. § 371 (criminalizing\nthe act of “conspir[ing] either to commit any offense against the\nUnited States, or to defraud the United States, or any agency thereof”)\nand 18 U.S.C. § 2 (criminalizing the act of “aid[ing] and abet[ting]\nthe commission of a crime against the United States”) by engaging in\ntransactions involving property with Cuba in contravention of the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n        Together, the Defendant, Don Brodie and The Bro-Tech\nCorporation owned 95% of the shares in Bro-Tech Limited; 5% of the\nshares were owned by a third-party.\n\n                                  11\n\fTWEA, 50 U.S.C. App. §§ 5(b) & 16,8 and CACR § 515.201(b), 31\nC.F.R. § 515.201(b). The conspiracy was alleged to have existed\nfrom approximately April 1993 to May 2000. Overt acts in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy were alleged to have begun on or about\nJune 21, 1994 and to have ended on or about July 31, 1999. The\novert acts involved the sale of ion exchange resins, payment for the\nproduct, and the payment of expenses related to business travel\nundertaken by Don Brodie, Mr. Sabzali and others to, from and\nwithin Cuba. Additionally, the grand jury indicted Don Brodie, The\nBro-Tech Corporation, and Mr. Sabzali for 76 additional substantive\nviolations of the TWEA and CACRs tied to specific sales of Purolite\n\n\n\n\n       8\n           Section 16 of the TWEA provides:\n\n       Whoever shall willfully violate any of the provisions\n       of this Act [sections 1 to 6, 7 to 39 and 41 to 44 of\n       this Appendix] or of any license, rule, or regulation\n       issued thereunder, and whoever shall willfully violate,\n       neglect, or refuse to comply with any order of the\n       President issued in compliance with the provisions of\n       the Act [said sections] shall, upon conviction, be fined\n       not more than $1,000,000, or if a natural person, be\n       fined not more than $100,000, or imprisoned for not\n       more than ten years, or both; and the officer, director,\n       or agent of any corporation who knowingly\n       participates in such violation shall, upon conviction,\n       be fined not more than $100,000 or imprisoned for not\n       more than ten years or both.\n\n50 U.S.C.

Proceedings Below\n\n        The District Court denied numerous pre-trial defense motions\nto dismiss the indictment. In particular, on August 14, 2001, the\nDistrict Court denied motions to dismiss the indictment based on (1)\nan alleged inconsistency between the CACRs and Section 620(a) of\nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 U.S.C. § 2370, and President\nKennedy’s February 3, 1962 Proclamation 3447 (27 Fed.

Bush on\nSeptember 13, 1991, was not published in the Federal Register until\nSeptember 23, 1991. Additionally, on October 24, 2001, the District\nCourt denied motions to dismiss all or parts of the indictment based\n\n\n\n       9\n         A fifth defendant, John H. Dolan, former director of\npurchasing for The Purlolite Company with whom the Customs\nagents met in the Bala Cynwyd office in February 1997, was also\nindicted for one count of making false statements to government\nofficials in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a). Mr. Dolan’s trial was\nsevered from that of his co-defendants, and he later pleaded guilty to\na superceding information charging one count of concealing\ninformation on imported articles and containers in violation of 19\nU.S.C. § 1304(a).

At the close of the\ngovernment’s evidence, the Defendant made a motion pursuant to\nFed.R.Crim.P. 29(a) for judgment of acquittal. The District Court\nreserved the motion pursuant to Rule 29(b),11 and the defense\nthereafter put on its case.

DISCUSSION\n\n        The bulk of the evidence presented by the government during\nthe joint trial of the Defendant and his three indicted co-conspirators\ndid not directly involve the Defendant’s participation in the\nunderlying conspiracy, but rather the accomplishment of particular\nillegal acts by Don Brodie and Mr. Sabzali. The District Court, in\nruling on the Defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, noted that\nthe Defendant and the government had agreed during oral argument\non the motion that:\n\n       a reasonable jury could find that [The] Bro-Tech\n       [Corporation] made the following sales to Cuba\n       through intermediaries ...\n\n       1. From 1992 to 1993, four sales were made by\n       Bro-Tech through a Canadian company. The sales\n       were booked at Bro-Tech, and the product was\n       manufactured by and shipped from Purolite\n       International. These sales were not charged in the\n       indictment.\n\n\n\n\n                                  20\n\f       2. From 1994 to 1996, thirty-five sales were made by\n       Bro-Tech through intermediaries in Canada and\n       Mexico. At times the product sold was manufactured\n       by and shipped from Bro-Tech, and at other times\n       Purolite International.\n\n       3. From 1997 to 1999, twenty-four sales were made\n       by Bro-Tech through the intermediary San Marco. All\n       sales in this period were booked at Purolite\n       International, and the product was manufactured by\n       and shipped from Purolite International.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 410-11. The fact that these sales transactions\noccurred, and the manner in which they were booked, manufactured\nand shipped, is important background to the evidence presented\nagainst the Defendant, but rather than set forth the evidence which\nwould support these facts, we too will incorporate this list of proven\ntransactions accepted by the District Court. See id.\n\n         Against the Defendant, the government presented what we\nwill categorize as six key pieces of circumstantial evidence: (1) the\nbasic company structure; (2) the “billing instruction,” and series of\nevents related to the 1992 audit of The Bro-Tech Corporation; (3) the\n“our friends in the Caribbean” speech; (4) Mr. Sabzali’s 1995\nperformance review; (5) the pervasive use of “code words” for Cuba\nby employees of The Bro-Tech Corporation d/b/a/ The Purolite\nCompany; and (6) several post-investigation events. This evidence\nis set forth in Section III.A of this opinion. In Section III.B, because\nwe recognize that further proceedings on remand may include a new\ntrial, we clarify the intent requirement for conspiracy to violate the\nTWEA and CACRs, and address the efficacy of the Defendant’s\nintent-based defense which posited that he did not understand it was\nunlawful for the U.K. entity to trade with Cuba and/or did not know\n\n\n                                  21\n\fthat the U.S. entity was actually involved in the trading. In Section\nIII.C, we assess the government’s evidence against the Defendant as\na comprehensive whole and in the light most favorable to the\ngovernment as required by the governing standard.\n\n       A.      The Evidence Against The Defendant\n\n       1.      Basic company structure\n\n        As noted above, the Defendant was the President and co-\nowner with his brother Don Brodie of The Bro-Tech Corporation,\nd/b/a “The Purolite Company.” Together with The Bro-Tech\nCorporation, the Defendant and Don Brodie also owned, in\napproximately 1/3 shares, Bro-Tech Limited, which was incorporated\nin the United Kingdom. Bro-Tech Limited, in turn, controlled\nPurolite International Limited, which was also incorporated in the\nUnited Kingdom. Both the U.S. and the U.K. entities were controlled\nby the Brodies. The Bro-Tech Corporation made over $2.1 million\ndollars in gross income from its trade with Cuba.\n\n        In his capacity as President, the Defendant oversaw the\nfinances of The Bro-Tech Corporation and Purolite International\nLimited, had direct supervision of Edward Grossman (who was The\nBro-Tech Corporation’s Chief Financial Officer), and served as the\nprimary contact for legal counsel to the company. The Defendant\nalso oversaw the European sales force, while Don Brodie oversaw the\nNorth American sales force and Philadelphia manufacturing facility.\nEdward Nace, a former products manager for The Purolite Company\nfrom 1993 to 1997 who worked from the Bala Cynwyd office as a\nliaison between sales and manufacturing, testified that both the\nDefendant and Don Brodie reviewed on a “fairly frequent[]” basis the\nhard-copy log book of daily purchase orders kept at the Bala Cynwyd\noffice, which listed customer name, type and quantity of product\n\n\n                                 22\n\fordered. Later, when the company switched to a computerized\nsystem, both brothers would review the daily “edit reports” listing\norders.\n\n        The office in Bala Cynwyd was located on one part of one\nfloor in an office building that housed numerous other companies.\nApproximately 30 employees worked in the Bala Cynwyd office,\nincluding both the Defendant and Don Brodie over the course of the\ncharged conspiracy, as well as Mr. Sabzali beginning in early 1996.\nMr. Sabzali and Don Brodie shared a secretary in the Bala Cynwyd\noffice, at least through early 1998, and the Defendant’s secretary, at\nleast through early 1998, had her desk physically located directly\noutside of Mr. Sabzali’s office.\n\n        On cross-examination, Mr. Grossman testified that during the\nrelevant time period (1993 to 2000), the Defendant spent a\n“significant amount of time” (estimated at 70 to 80 %) away from the\nBala Cynwyd office establishing new manufacturing plants and sales\noffices in China and Romania.\n\n       2.      The billing instruction, audit and related events\n\n        During 1992, from his office in Canada, Mr. Sabzali sold\nPurolite product through the Canadian subsidiary (“Purolite Canada”)\nin four transactions to Galax, Incorporated (“Galax”). The product\nwas booked and invoiced from the Bala Cynwyd office, but\nmanufactured by and shipped from the U.K. entity. In 1986, the\nUnited States Department of Treasury had designated Galax a\n“specially designated national,” i.e., a company with which American\ncompanies were prohibited from transacting business because the\n\n\n\n\n                                 23\n\fdesignated company was known to have ties with Cuba.16 While\nthese 1992 transactions with Galax were not charged in the\nindictment, they are important background to much of the evidence\npresented against the Defendant because trial testimony established\nthat, in early 1993, the auditing firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP\nconducted an audit of The Bro-Tech Corporation for the year 1992\nand found reference to one of the 1992 sales to Galax. The auditor-\nin-charge, Mr. Stephen Coulter, CPA, brought the reference directly\nto the Defendant’s attention, and this touched off a series of events,\nevidence of which forms the basis for the linchpin inference urged by\nthe government in this prosecution – i.e., that the Defendant knew his\ncompany was conducting illegal sales transactions with Cuba and\nknew that the U.S. entity was involved, or was at least willfully blind\nto that involvement. That the 1992 transaction with Galax had\noccurred and how the auditor’s concern about it was handled by the\nDefendant are critical. While the trial testimony concerning this\nseries of events was often confusing and sometimes contradictory, we\nattempt to set it forth as coherently as possible and in the light most\nfavorable to the government.\n\n        We begin with the evidence related to what we will call “the\nbilling instruction.” Mr. Grossman (former CFO of The Bro-Tech\nCorporation) testified on direct examination that he was personally\naware of a sales transaction made to Galax in 1992. He explained\nhow he came to possess that knowledge:\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          A senior enforcement investigations officer of OFAC,\ntestifying for the government, explained the term SDN, that Galax\nwas an SDN, and that it had been so designated in 1986. See 31\nC.F.R. § 500.306 (defining “specially designated national”); see also\n31 C.F.R. Ch. V, App. A (2005) (listing Galax, Inc. as an SDN).\n\n                                  24\n\f       Q:      And how do you know that – or how were you\n               aware of it? ...\n\n       A:      Yes. During the year, in 1992 at some point,\n               [the Defendant] called me into his office and\n               indicated that there had been an invoice, this\n               Galax, and that it had a reference to Cuba on\n               there and that I should instruct the customer\n               service department, the billing department, to\n               make certain that they don’t include any\n               reference to Cuba in any future invoices on the\n               face of the invoice.\n\n       Q:      Was that in 1992?\n\n       A:      I believe so.\n\n       Q:      Did you give such an instruction to the billing\n               department?\n\n       A:      Yes, I did.\n\nA. 716 (Grossman, direct).\n\n        Next is the evidence related to the audit. Deloitte & Touche\nhad been performing audits for The Bro-Tech Corporation since\napproximately 1988, and for the year 1992, had been engaged to\nexpress an opinion on the combined financial statements of The Bro-\nTech Corporation and Bro-Tech Limited. In the course of performing\nthe 1992 audit early in 1993, the auditors “found a shipment into\nCuba on a sales transaction .... [in a] dollar amount ... between 2 and\n$300,000...” A. 304 (Coulter, direct). The occurrence of this\ntransaction was significant to the auditors because, as Mr. Coulter\n\n\n                                  25\n\fexplained, “[w]e are aware that U.S. companies were not supposed to\nbe shipping goods into Cuba because of the American boycott,” and\n“to the extent a transaction is a potential illegal act, the auditor is\nobligated to follow up on that transaction to determine the potential\nconsequences both from a financial reporting as well as a disclosure\npoint of view.” A. 304-05 (Coulter, direct). The auditors were\nconcerned that The Bro-Tech Corporation would be subject to a\nmonetary fine for the Galax transaction, which, depending on the\nlikelihood of assessment, would have to be addressed in the audit in\na particular fashion. In light of this concern, Mr. Coulter spoke\ndirectly to the Defendant, as President of The Bro-Tech Corporation,\nabout the Galax transaction and its implications for the audit. Mr.\nCoulter testified as to that conversation:\n\n       Q:      Was that [conversation with the Defendant]\n               on the telephone or face to face or in what\n               way?\n\n       A:      Well, there were numerous discussions\n               regarding the liability. Some were by\n               telephone, some were face to face and we did\n               have discussions, in addition to [the\n               Defendant] had discussions with Ed\n               Grossman.\n\n               ...\n\n       Q:      And when you talked to [the Defendant], what\n               was his explanation regarding this\n               transaction?\n\n       A:      [The Defendant] indicated that the transaction\n               had been effected by a new salesman with the\n\n\n                                  26\n\f               company and that it was one transaction and\n               he understood that they should not be doing\n               this, and he was going to take steps to insure\n               that the company would detect any such\n               proposed transactions in the future.\n\nA. 307 (Coulter, direct). Other testimony supported that the Galax\nsale under discussion had been arranged by Mr. Sabzali operating\nfrom Canada, and that he had been a salesman for the company since\napproximately 1990 – i.e., two to three years before the outlined\nconversation. Two “steps” were taken in the wake of the\nconversation between the Defendant and Mr. Coulter concerning the\nGalax transaction. We present these “steps” first as filtered through\nthe eyes of the auditors and then as they were “implemented” by The\nBro-Tech Corporation.\n\n        Subsequent to the conversation outlined above, the Defendant\nshowed Mr. Coulter a copy of the following memorandum written on\nPurolite letterhead:\n\n       April 7, 1993\n\n       To:     All Sales Offices\n\n       From: Steve Brodie\n\n       CC:     Don Brodie/Ed Grossman\n\n       It has come to our attention, during the 1992 audit,\n       that a sale was made to the Canadian Company,\n       Galax. The Galax credit was checked in our\n       Philadelphia office, and approved. Subsequent to the\n\n\n\n                                   27\n\f       approval of the order, our shipping department in the\n       UK was ordered to drop-ship this order to Cuba.\n\n       While it is proper to ship this order from the UK in\n       terms of UK law, it is contrary to USA policy and law\n       to ship material of any kind to the island nation of\n       Cuba in violation of the US embargo. Brotech\n       Corporation is a US Corporate citizen, and as such,\n       has no intention of violating US policy, now nor in the\n       future.\n\n       No shipment of Purolite merchandise is to be shipped\n       to, redirected to, or trans-shipped to Cuba. Any\n       requests to do so are to be reported to Don or me.\n\n       /s/ Steve Brodie\n\nA. 206 (Gov. Ex. 11) (hereinafter the “future policy memorandum”)\n(emphasis added). In addition to being the purported issuer of the\nfuture policy memorandum, the Defendant had also signed it. Mr.\nCoulter, however, did not find the memorandum helpful for deciding\nhow to characterize the Galax transaction for auditing purposes, and\nhis reaction to the memorandum set off another important response\nfrom the Defendant. As Mr. Coulter explained:\n\n       Q:      When you saw this document, were you\n               satisfied it took care of the problem?\n\n       A:      No, we were not.\n\n       Q:      And why not?\n\n\n\n\n                                  28\n\f        A:       Well, essentially that was certainly appropriate\n                 going forward to insure that there were no\n                 shipments to Cuba and we fully supported\n                 that, however, the fact of the matter was that\n                 there was a shipment in 1992 to Cuba and we\n                 did not know the legal ramifications of that.\n                 And we were requesting from the company a\n                 legal opinion with respect to their exposure.\n\n        Q:       And what was [the Defendant’s] reaction\n                 when you told him you wanted a legal\n                 opinion?\n\n        A:       Well, again, because it was a single\n                 transaction performed by a salesman that was\n                 new to the company, [the Defendant] felt like\n                 we were overreacting in requesting a legal\n                 opinion and he did not want to incur the cost\n                 of a legal opinion.\n\nA. 314-15 (Coulter, direct) The legal opinion requested by Mr\nCoulter was subsequently obtained, and Mr. Coulter participated in\na telephone discussion of that opinion with the attorney involved.\nMr. Coulter testified that the legal opinion, “together with\nmanagement’s representation that the transaction was unintentional\nand inadvertent,” were relied upon by the auditors in determining that\nthe possibility of a fine related to the transaction was “remote.” A.\n315 (Coulter, direct). The “remote” characterization was significant\nto the auditors because, as Mr. Coulter explained, “‘remote’ mean[t\nthat] it’s less likely that a liability [here, a fine] has been incurred, and\nin that instance there would be no requirement to either disclose or\nrecord the liability” in the audit. A. 306-07 (Coulter, direct). When\nthe 1992 audit report for The Bro-Tech Corporation was subsequently\n\n\n                                     29\n\fissued in July 1993, Deloitte & Touche also sent a letter addressed to\nthe “directors of Bro-Tech Corporation trading as the Purolite\nCompany to the attention of [the Defendant], President,” in which the\nauditors characterized the legal opinion as they had understood and\nrelied upon it in issuing the 1992 audit:\n\n       The company inadvertently entered into a sales\n       transaction with a new customer that is listed by the\n       U.S. Department of Treasury as a specially designated\n       national (SDN). Sales to SDN’s are prohibited by law\n       and carry potential civil penalties which, depending\n       on intent, could be significant. The company’s legal\n       counsel has indicated based on very limited\n       knowledge of the transaction and the related federal\n       laws that since the sale was unintentional, the\n       likelihood of fines and penalties being assessed is\n       remote in this particular case.\n\nA. 319 (Coulter, direct) (reading Gov. Ex. 4). Mr. Grossman testified\nthat he had received a copy of this letter most likely through the\nDefendant’s secretary.\n\n       Prior to the issuance of the 1992 audit report in July 1993,\nanother “step” was taken in the wake of the auditors’ concern with the\nGalax transaction. When asked if the Defendant had made any other\nsuggestions regarding what might be done with the Galax transaction\nin terms of accounting, Mr. Coulter testified:\n\n       A:      At one point in the process of dealing with\n               this issue, there was a suggestion that the sale\n               recorded in Bro-Tech Corporation’s books be\n               transferred to Bro-Tech, Limited’s [i.e., the\n               U.K. entity’s] books.\n\n\n                                 30\n\f       Q:      And what was your response to that?\n\n       A:      After considering it, we felt like we would\n               still need a legal opinion because the sales\n               transaction was initially recorded in Bro-Tech\n               Corporation’s books to begin with, and that\n               even if it were transferred to Bro-Tech,\n               Limited, we would not know the legal\n               implications of that either.\n\n       Q:      Did that go any further, that suggestion?\n\n       A:      I don’t believe it did, no.\n\nA. 320 (Coulter, direct).17 On cross-examination, Mr. Coulter\nexplained that, in addition to recommending that a legal opinion be\nobtained with respect to treatment of the Galax transaction for audit\npurposes, Deloitte & Touche recommended that a set of checks be\ninstituted by the company to make certain that SDNs would not\nbecome clients in the future. Someone from The Bro-Tech\nCorporation – although their identity is not clear – told Mr. Coulter\nthat such checks would be implemented.18 A few months after the\n\n\n       17\n         But see infra. at 32-34, reviewing Grossman’s testimony\nabout transferring the sale to the U.K. entity’s books.\n       18\n         Also on cross-examination, Mr. Coulter explained that he\nhad participated in a telephone conversation during this same time\nperiod related to the Galax transaction with someone at Coopers and\nLybrand, which was then performing audits for Bro-Tech Limited in\nthe United Kingdom. The impetus for the conversation was Deloitte\n& Touche’s engagement to express a combined audit for The Bro-\nTech Corporation and Bro-Tech Limited for 1992, and Deloitte &\n\n                                  31\n\f1992 audit report was issued in July 1993, someone from The Bro-\nTech Corporation – again their identity is unclear – informed Deloitte\n& Touche that it was being replaced by Coopers and Lybrand.19 Mr.\nCoulter acknowledged on cross-examination that Coopers and\nLybrand had already been performing audits for Bro-Tech Limited.\nHe also acknowledged that the Defendant had been upset with the\nperceived untimeliness and expense of the 1992 audit report.\n\n        Mr. Grossman provided the view from inside The Bro-Tech\nCorporation concerning how the “steps” identified by Mr. Coulter\nwere actually implemented by the company in the wake of the\nauditors’ concern with the Galax transaction. He testified that indeed\na transfer of a Galax transaction to the books of Bro-Tech Limited did\noccur, but his testimony was confusing as to whether that transfer\ninvolved the 1992 Galax transaction found by Deloitte & Touche or\nanother Galax transaction in 1993. He testified:\n\n       Q:      ... [Y]ou were aware of – you testified you\n               were aware of a Galax sale in ‘92, but you’re\n               not sure if it’s the same one that the auditors\n               found?\n\n       A:      Correct.\n\n\nTouche’s concern that there may be additional shipments to Cuba\nrelevant to the combined audit.\n       19\n          This fact was important to the government, which urged an\ninference that the switch in auditors was undertaken to punish\nDeloitte & Touche for finding and focusing on the problematic Galax\ntransaction and/or to ensure that The Bro-Tech Corporation was not\nbeing serviced by auditors already aware of and therefore more prone\nto scrutinize the company’s transactions for Cuban ties.\n\n                                 32\n\fQ:   What if any sales were you aware of to Galax\n     in 1993?\n\nA:   I’m not aware of any sales certainly that were\n     processed through the United States office.\n     Again, I believe – I’m sorry, I think that there\n     was a transaction in 1993 that had initially\n     been billed by the U.S. office and when this\n     was found a decision was made to in essence\n     transfer the sale to – so that it would come\n     through Purolite International Limited, monies\n     that were collected in connection with this\n     sale were collected by the U.S. company and\n     transferred to Purolite International Limited.\n\nQ:   Can you take a look, sir, at Government\n     Exhibit 10? Do you recognize that document?\n\nA:   Yes, I do.\n\nQ:   Is there a notation concerning something that\n     you asked to be done?\n\nA:   It’s dated March 31st, 1993. ‘Per Ed. G.,’\n     which would be myself –\n\n     ...\n\nQ:   [ ] Do you want to tell us what this is all\n     about?\n\nA:   Again, this is a handwritten note dated 3/31/93\n     and it says “Per Ed. G.,” which is myself,\n\n\n                       33\n\f               “$330,103.20 sale to be reversed, cash to be\n               reversed and forwarded to Purolite\n               International Limited,” it says, “conversation”\n               or “conversion to be Bala’s responsibility.”\n\n       Q:      Well, did you make – who if anyone made that\n               decision with you?\n\n       A:      This decision would have been made in\n               conjunction with [the Defendant], it probably\n               would have been a conversation that we had\n               once we understood that there was, you know,\n               a transaction related to Cuba and that there\n               would be funds coming into Purolite\n               Company as a result of that transaction.\n\n       Q:      Is this at the time of the audit?\n\n       A:      Yes. March 31st, ‘93, so the audit would have\n               taken place – either been completed shortly\n               before that or some time around that time\n               frame.\n\nA. 720-722 (Grossman, direct).\n\n        Mr. Grossman also testified regarding the future policy\nmemorandum, a critical piece of evidence for both the prosecution\nand the defense. Handwritten on the copy of the future policy\nmemorandum admitted at trial was a faxed notation, indicating that\nthe memorandum had been faxed as addressed on April 7, 1993, to all\nsales offices, as well as to, inter alia, Don Brodie and Mr. Grossman.\nMr. Grossman testified that he received a copy; another salesman\ntestified that he did not. In addition to the memorandum itself\n\n\n                                  34\n\fconstituting evidence, Mr. Grossman testified that it was his\nunderstanding that the memorandum encapsulated The Bro-Tech\nCorporation’s policy regarding sales to Cuba in the future. On direct\nexamination, he testified:\n\n       Q:      What if any decisions were made by [the\n               Defendant] in response to the Deloitte &\n               Touche audit?\n\n       A:      My understanding is that any – any orders\n               having to do with Cuba would be processed\n               through the U.K. company. My understanding\n               at that time was that they did not have the\n               same restrictions on shipping to Cuba and this\n               if there, you know, was business having to do\n               with that it would – material would not only\n               be shipped from Purolite Limited, but it would\n               be, you know, billed by Purolite International\n               Limited[].\n\nA. 719 (Grossman, direct). Mr. Grossman provided further critical\ntestimony regarding the future policy memorandum on cross-\nexamination, which we set forth in full:\n\n       Q:      As a result of [ ] those events [i.e., the audit\n               events just discussed, having occurred in early\n               1993], you indicated that [the Defendant]\n               issued the memorandum that you looked at\n               dated April 7, 1993 [i.e., the future policy\n               memorandum], correct?\n\n       A:      Correct.\n\n\n\n                                 35\n\fQ:   And as a result of those events the policy of\n     Purolite in the U.S. going forward was that if\n     future materials were to be shipped to Cuba\n     they would be shipped from Purolite\n     International in the United Kingdom and\n     billed by Purolite International in the United\n     Kingdom, correct?\n\nA:   That was my understanding, yes.\n\nQ:   And that was different from what had\n     happened in 1992, because in 1992 all of the\n     product had been manufactured and shipped\n     from the United Kingdom, [but] it was billed\n     out of the United States entity, correct?\n\nA:   It was billed out of the United States entity. I\n     can’t say without a doubt that a hundred\n     percent of the material came from Purolite\n     International Limited, I don’t know where all\n     of the material came to fill those orders, I\n     know that some ...\n\nQ:   Your understanding at the time was that it had\n     come from Purolite International, correct?\n\nA:   At least primarily, yeah.\n\nQ:   Now, you understood at that time that it was\n     lawful to ship product to Cuba from the\n     United Kingdom, did you not?\n\n\n\n\n                       36\n\fA:   I understood, it was explained to me at some\n     point in time that they did not have the same\n     prohibition in the United Kingdom as we have\n     in the United States.\n\nQ:   And [the Defendant] told you in 1993 that he\n     understood that it was lawful for entities in the\n     United Kingdom to ship product to Cuba,\n     correct?\n\nA:   Yes.\n\nQ:   Now, in light of that decision [i.e., in April\n     1993], your understanding of what both Bro-\n     Tech’s finance department and Bro-Tech in\n     the United States should be doing generally\n     was that there should not be any future\n     transactions involving Bro-Tech in the U.S.\n     that involved the sale of product to Cuba,\n     correct?\n\nA:   Correct.\n\nQ:   And [the Defendant] told you as part of that\n     decision [i.e., in 1993] that future invoices\n     coming out of Bro-Tech should not reflect\n     sales to Cuba, correct?\n\nA:   Correct.\n\nQ:   And that was because future sales were\n     supposed to go out of Purolite International in\n     the United Kingdom, correct?\n\n\n                        37\n\fA:   This is after – you’re talking about after the\n     Deloitte & Touche –\n\nQ:   After the Deloitte & Touche audit.\n\nA:   Correct.\n\nQ:   So your mission, as you understood it going\n     forward from 1993, was to ensure that your\n     finance department was not causing\n     transactions to be booked out of the United\n     States that involved sale of product to Cuba?\n\nA:   My understanding was that was not supposed\n     to happen. It was [the Defendant’s] and Don\n     Brodie’s company, so it wasn’t my decision as\n     to – you know, to accept orders and to conduct\n     commerce with Cuba, so my understanding is\n     that that wasn’t going to happen and that any\n     commerce with Cuba would be transacted\n     through Purolite International, Limited.\n\nQ:   ... You didn’t receive any instruction at that\n     time to delete or alter or destroy any records\n     that related to Cuba in 1993, did you?\n\nA:   That’s correct.\n\nQ:   And you didn’t give any such instructions to\n     anyone within the finance department,\n     correct?\n\nA:   That’s correct.\n\n\n                       38\n\f       Q:     So for the 1992 transactions that had\n              happened with Galax, the documents that\n              related to those remained within the finance\n              department of Bro-Tech, correct?\n\n       A:     That’s correct [presumably, this suggests that,\n              although the 1992 Galax sale had been\n              transferred to Purolite International’s books,\n              Bro-Tech in the United States still had records\n              relating to that sale and the fact that it had\n              been transferred].\n\n              ...\n\n       Q:     Now, is it fair to say that in addition to the\n              principle that sales would now be booked out\n              of the U.K., you were taking efforts to ensure\n              that if anyone affiliated with Bro-Tech\n              traveled to Cuba that the expenses associated\n              with that travel would be borne by the United\n              Kingdom entity?\n\n       A:     Yes.\n\n       Q:     And that was because based on your\n              understanding the United States entity was not\n              to be involved in activity with respect to\n              Cuba?\n\n       A:     That’s correct.\n\nA. 747-49, 752 (Grossman, cross-examination).\n\n\n\n                                39\n\f       3.     The “Our friends in the Caribbean” speech\n\n        Craig Gentile, a regional salesman for The Bro-Tech\nCorporation from 1990 to 1997, testified that the company held bi-\nannual sales meetings in the spring and fall. Asked whether Cuba or\nsales to Cuba were ever mentioned at those meetings, he testified:\n\n       A:     There was only one time that Cuba was ever\n              mentioned in a sales meeting. ... It was either\n              fall of ‘91 or spring of ‘92. And we met at the\n              manufacturing facility in Philadelphia,\n              downstairs, and everybody gave their\n              presentation on their sales and what they were\n              going to do, projections for the next year or\n              how they had done previously. And Jim\n              Sabzali got up to give his presentation and\n              during his presentation he said that this was\n              the business that they were going to be doing\n              in Cuba and ...\n\n       Q:     What happened then?\n\n       A:     [The Defendant] jumped up, he was very\n              excited – I don’t remember exactly what he\n              said, but [Mr. Sabzali] just smiled and said,\n              [‘] well I mean our friends in the Caribbean.[’]\n\n              ...\n\n       Q:     What was your reaction to what happened?\n\n       A:     I was surprised that [Mr. Sabzali] brought it up.\n\n\n\n                                40\n\f       Q:      What was the reaction of any other salespeople in the\n               room?\n\n       A:      I think everybody was surprised, it got very quiet.\n               Then we proceeded.\n\nA. 362-363 (Gentile, direct).\n\n         Mr. Gentile was questioned on cross-examination as to the\ndate of this incident. He had previously told the grand jury that the\nevent occurred in 1993 and on cross-examination at trial he\nacknowledged this previous testimony. A. 371 (Gentile, cross-\nexamination) (“[Gentile]: I don’t have the transcript, but if that’s\nwhat it says, that’s what I said.”). However, as set forth above, his\ntrial testimony placed the incident earlier in time, and before the\nevents of the 1992 audit report.\n\n       4.      Mr. Sabzali’s 1995 performance review\n\n        Mr. Sabzali, who had arranged the transactions with Galax in\n1992 from his Canadian office and who had spoken of Cuban sales\nduring the sales presentation witnessed by Mr. Gentile, was promoted\nin 1995 to the position of Director of Marketing for the North\nAmerican operations of The Bro-Tech Corporation, and reassigned as\na result from Canada to the Bala Cynwyd office. The basis for the\npromotion was summed up in a type-written performance review\ndated May 16, 1995. Critically, the performance review took note of\nMr. Sabzali’s development of the “Caribbean territory to make\nPurolite the dominant player” and his procurement of “sales in\nMexico as an adjunct to the Caribbean.” A. 207 (Gov. Ex. 14).20\n\n       20\n         As explained infra., “Caribbean” was generally understood\nand used by many Bro-Tech/Purolite employees to refer to Cuba. On\n\n                                 41\n\fHandwritten at the bottom of the performance review was the\nnotation: “New Position, Salary $102,000, Effective 4/1/94.” A\nrelated memorandum identified Mr. Sabzali’s responsibilities in the\nnew position; importantly, however, he was to “continue handling the\nCaribbean areas for North America.” Mr. Grossman testified that the\nhandwritten notation at the bottom of the performance review “looks\nlike the handwriting of – or the printing of [the Defendant],” A. 731\n(Grossman, direct),21 and another former employee, Daniel\nOpperman, testified that while it was Don Brodie who had hired Mr.\nOpperman, it was the Defendant who had promoted him.\n\n       5.      Pervasive use of “code words” for Cuba\n\n         A number of former employees of The Bro-Tech Corporation\ntestified that they understood, at the time of their employment during\nthe relevant time period, that terms like “the Caribbean,” “the island”\nand “that island” were used to refer to Cuba. Specifically, Mr.\nGrossman testified that “Caribbean island was kind of a code word\nfor Cuba after Deloitte and Touche’s findings in early 1993,” A. 725\n(Grossman, direct), and that “Caribbean meant Cuba.” Id. at 728.\n\n\ndirect examination, Mr. Grossman testified that he could recall only\none other customer in the Caribbean, and that he too understood\nCaribbean to mean Cuba.\n       21\n          As the District Court pointed out, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 416\nn.3, there were problems with Mr. Grossman’s testimony in that he\ndid not specifically clarify that he had ever seen the Defendant’s\nhandwriting, and the defense was apparently caught off-guard by the\ngovernment’s elicitation of this lay opinion testimony on handwriting\nduring the trial. However, because no objection to this testimony was\nmade at trial, we, like the District Court, will consider it legitimate\nevidence for the jury to consider.\n\n                                  42\n\fMr. Sabzali’s secretary in the Bala Cynwyd office from 1996 to early\n1998 testified that she recalled two conversations with Mr. Sabzali\nregarding Cuba, one of which she described as a “sort of smiling\nconversation where he said, we refer to it as the island, not by its\nformal name.” A. 1302 (Lenton, direct). Ms. Graves, a former\ncustomer services employee in charge of processing sales orders for\nThe Purolite Company at the Bala Cynwyd office from approximately\n1995 until her retirement in January 1999, testified that she and her\ncounterpart in the Canada office would frequently talk about\nshipments to Cuba, but specified that in so doing, “[w]e didn’t refer\nto them as shipments to Cuba, but ... as shipments to that island.” A.\n880 (Graves, direct). Mr. Nace testified that he had told Mr. Sabzali\nthat he was uncomfortable receiving faxes from Sabzali openly\nreferring to Cuba and as a result, Mr. Sabzali referred to Cuba, at least\nin dealings with Mr. Nace, as the Caribbean. Mr. Carlos Lugo, who\noperated as a salesman of The Purolite Company in Mexico from\nMay 1996 to 2000,22 testified with reference to an expense report that\nhe had turned in to the Bala Cywyd office related to travel through\nJanuary 1998 that “Mr. Ed Grossman called me and said to me that\nthat report had to be redone because I stated that I was going to\nHavana and the name Havana could not be in the report.” A. 601\n(Lugo, direct). There was also testimony that words like Havana and\n\n\n\n        22\n         Mr. Lugo testified that in September 1995, he was contacted\nby someone he characterized as the international manager of the\nPurolite Company based in Bala Cynwyd, and asked to help\nincorporate an arm of the Purolite Company in Mexico. In 1996, Mr.\nLugo “started as an employee of the Mexican entity” which was\nowned “when it was created ... 50 percent by Mr. Don Brodie and 50\npercent by [the Defendant].” A. 580 (Lugo, direct). Later, according\nto Mr. Lugo, “98 percent of the shares were transferred to The Bro-\nTech Corporation.” Id.\n\n                                   43\n\fCuba were sometimes used rather openly in transaction and expense-\nrelated documentation.\n\n       6.      Post-investigation events\n\n         On February 5, 1997, and pursuant to an earlier telephone\nconversation, Customs agents visited the Bala Cynwyd office and met\nwith Mr. Dolan. At that meeting, an agent “apprised Mr. Dolan that\nwe [Customs] had an investigation and it appeared, based on records\nthat I had in my possession and confidential source information, that\nthere were violations of illegal exports relative to the OFAC\nregulations.” A. 1447 (McCrosson, direct). According to the agent,\nMr. Dolan responded that he had “researched [the company’s] files\nbased on the previous phone call and said he could only locate one\ndocument relative to the names I had provided him.” Id. Mr. Dolan\nthen showed the agents a copy of the future policy memorandum,\nwhich purported to state as a matter of company policy that the U. S.\nentity was not to be involved in any sales to Cuba. With this\nbackground, we present the evidence related to the post-investigation\nevents.\n\n       a.      The Sabzali memoranda\n\n        The government introduced three memoranda written by Mr.\nSabzali in the weeks following the Customs agents’ visit. The first,\ndated February 28, 1997, and addressed to Pilar Guzman, a woman\nthrough whom Purolite product was sold to Cuban end-users,\nprovided in pertinent part: “Please note that pricing to San Marco\nwill change slightly for the four orders being ready, as well as for\nfuture orders. The reason is that we now have to ship products from\nU.K., and the easiest method would be to ship directly to Havana, and\nnot to Tampico.” A. 1310-11 (Lenton, direct, reading from Gov. Ex.\n77) (emphasis added). The first memorandum did not identify the\n\n\n                                 44\n\fDefendant as someone intended to receive a copy – he was not, in\nother words, “carbon copied” on the first memorandum. The second\nmemorandum, also dated February 28, 1997, was addressed to an\nItalian representative of The Purolite Company, and provided, in\npertinent part: “For future reference, please note that orders will be\nsent from Milan to Pontyclun, but invoicing will be done directly\nfrom Ponty to the customer in the Caribbean.” A. 1313 (Lenton,\ndirect, reading from Gov. Ex. 78) (emphasis added). The subject line\non the second memorandum referenced “four orders for the\nCaribbean.” Id. The Defendant was carbon copied on this second\nmemorandum, and the secretary who faxed it testified that he would\nhave received his copy in the Bala Cynwyd office. The third\nmemorandum, dated March 3, 1997, and carbon copied to the\nDefendant, provided further details regarding the “Caribbean orders,”\nconfirmed that the sales would be handled entirely through Purolite\nInternational Limited, and openly listed the place of shipment as\nHavana, Cuba.\n\n       b.      Telephone calls\n\n        The government offered testimony related to two telephone\ncalls made by the Defendant after the investigation which lead to the\nindictment was underway. In September 1999, months after she had\nretired from The Purolite Company, Ms. Graves, the former sales\nprocessing clerk, received a telephone call from the Defendant at her\nhome. She testified:\n\n       A:      He asked me if I had been contacted by\n               anyone from the Government regarding the\n               Cuba sales.\n\n       Q:      And what did you say?\n\n\n\n                                 45\n\f       A:      I said yes, I had, and then he – I mentioned\n               that I had been questioned about, I believe it\n               was the shipments for Galax, and I mentioned\n               that there were other shipments after those,\n               and I said but I can’t remember the name of\n               the company.\n\n       Q:      Shipments where?\n\n       A:      To Cuba. And he said [‘] well, if you can’t\n               remember the name, then you don’t have\n               anything to tell them.[’]\n\nA. 881 (Graves, direct). As noted above, the Defendant agreed during\noral argument on the motion for acquittal that other evidence in the\ngovernment’s case would support a finding that “from 1994 to 1996,\nthirty-five sales were made by Bro-Tech through intermediaries in\nCanada and Mexico.” See supra. at 20-21. The intermediary in\nMexico was an entity known as Ingenieria y Mantenimiento Industrial\n(or “IMI”) and shipments to IMI occurred after the Galax sales. Ms.\nGraves testified that, as a former sales processing clerk, she knew of\nthe sales through IMI. On cross-examination, Ms. Graves\nacknowledged that the Defendant had expressed “interest and\ncuriosity” about the subject matter of the government investigation\nduring their telephone conversation, and that she knew at the time she\nwas interviewed by the government that the company had legal\ncounsel whom she did not advise of the interview. Additionally, she\ntestified that she had reported the telephone call to the government\nand agreed to have a wire installed on her phone to record any future\ncalls from the Defendant, but he never called again.\n\n       The second telephone call identified by the government was\npurportedly made by the Defendant to Mr. Lugo, the Purolite\n\n\n                                 46\n\fsalesman in Mexico. Mr. Lugo testified that he had met someone at\nthe United States Embassy in Mexico City at the request of the United\nStates government sometime after December 1997 or 1998.23 There,\nhe was asked “some questions regarding why I went to Cuba. ... if I\ngo to Cuba for business or anything.” A. 607 (Lugo, direct).\nSubsequent to that meeting, Mr. Lugo reported on it at Mr. Sabzali’s\nrequest to Mr. Dolan. Mr. Lugo testified that he then received a\ntelephone call from the Defendant:\n\n       Q:      What if any conversations did you have with\n               [the Defendant] about your embassy visit?\n\n       A:      After my visit, [the Defendant] called me and\n               said to me not to do it again with[out] inform\n               – informing before.\n\n       Q:      Not to do what again?\n\n       A:      To go to the [United States] embassy.\n\nA. 612 (Lugo, direct).           On cross-examination, Mr. Lugo\nacknowledged that he knew at the time of his interview at the United\nStates Embassy that the company was represented by counsel and\nunder investigation for trading with Cuba. He also acknowledged\nthat he had previously testified before the grand jury that the embassy\nvisit occurred sometime in April or May 1999, and that it was Mr.\nSabzali, not the Defendant, who informed him following that visit\n\n       23\n         It is unclear from the record, and apparently unclear to Mr.\nLugo himself, exactly why he was contacted by the United States and\nasked to visit the Embassy in Mexico City. He had, however,\npreviously had two boxes of Cuban cigars confiscated from him by\nthe United States Customs Service in Washington, D.C.\n\n                                  47\n\fthat the Defendant did not want him to go to the embassy again\nwithout informing the company.\n\n       B.      The Intent Requirement\n\n        On appeal, the Defendant argues in support of a separate\nground for affirming the judgment of acquittal – specifically, that the\ngovernment was required and failed to show that the Defendant had\nknowledge of the specific CACR or licensing provision which he and\nhis co-conspirators were found to have violated. This argument relies\non an inaccurate statement of the law, which we find necessary to\ncorrect in order to guide the District Court on remand should there be\na new trial.\n\n       The Defendant was indicted for conspiracy to violate Section\n16 of the TWEA and CACR § 515.201(b), and accordingly the\ngovernment, in proving a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371, was\nrequired to prove at least the degree of criminal intent necessary for\nthe underlying substantive offense of violating the American Cuban\nembargo.

As noted, the government\npursued the willful blindness theory of knowledge at trial and the\nDistrict Court provided a correct willful blindness instruction to the\njury.\n\n         The indictment and the evidence presented by the government\nin this case naturally tended to divide the overt acts in furtherance of\nthe conspiracy into two time frames: (1) 1994 (when the first overt\nact was alleged to have occurred) through late 1996, and (2) early\n1997 (when Customs agents first visited the Bala Cynwyd office) to\nMay 2000 (the end of the alleged conspiracy).24 We understand the\ndefense to have incorporated these two time frames into its argument\nas to why the government failed to prove that the Defendant acted\nwith the requisite intent. He argues on appeal that the evidence “is\nconsistent with the fact that [he] did not know that any transactions\nwith Cuba were being carried out unlawfully through the United\nStates. Rather, he believed that all transactions with Cuba were being\n\n       24\n         Indeed as the Defendant states in his brief on appeal, “[t]he\ngovernment introduced evidence that, from 1994-1996, [The] Bro-\nTech [Corporation] engaged in transactions that ultimately involved\nCuba. From 1997-1999, however, [The] Bro-Tech [Corporation] did\nnot engage in sales to Cuba. Rather, sales to Cuba in 1997-1999 were\nhandled by PIL [Purolite International Limited] in the United\nKingdom, without United States involvement.” Brief of Appellee at\n10.\n\n                                  51\n\fhandled lawfully by entities in Canada and the United Kingdom\nwithout United States involvement.” Brief of Appellee at 11. In\nother words, the Defendant contends that he believed at all times\npertinent to the charged conspiracy that trading with Cuba was lawful\nso long as conducted through the U.K. entity without the participation\nof the U.S. entity. To the extent that the evidence showed the U.S.\nentity was actually involved in the transactions from 1994 through\n1996 (which, as noted above, the Defendant agreed the evidence\ncould prove), then Defendant posits that he did not know of that\ninvolvement, and hence could not have willfully violated the law. As\nfor the transactions which occurred from early 1997 through the end\nof the charged conspiracy, the Defendant posits that he did not know\nthat trading with Cuba through a foreign subsidiary owned or\ncontrolled by a American citizen was illegal, and hence could not\nhave acted with intent to violate the law.\n\n         Implicit in this defense strategy (and indeed obvious from the\nface of the future policy memorandum that the Defendant purportedly\nwrote and relies heavily upon for his defense) is an admission that the\nDefendant understood that the U.S. entity was prohibited from trading\nwith Cuba, and indeed, that was a correct interpretation of the law.\nTo the extent that the Defendant also believed it was lawful for the\nU.K. entity to trade with Cuba so long as the U.S. entity was not\ninvolved, his interpretation of the law was incorrect, because as\nwritten, the CACRs prohibit entities which are “owned or controlled”\nby American citizens from trading with Cuba. See 31 C.F.R.\n§§ 515.201(b), 515.329 (a), (c).25 We do not find it necessary,\n\n       25\n         The Defendant informs us in a footnote in his brief on appeal\nthat “evidence in the defense case demonstrated that [the Defendant]\ntolerated these transactions only because he believed – based on\ninformation from the British government and Bro-Tech’s outside\ncounsel, Morgan Lewis [& Bockius LLP] – that it would be illegal in\n\n                                  52\n\fhowever, to determine whether the Defendant’s mistaken\nunderstanding of the law as it related to trade conducted solely\nthrough the U.K. entity in the latter time period should negate a\nfinding of specific intent and thereby support acquittal because, for\nreasons that will become clearer as we examine the reasonable\ninferences that arise from the government’s evidence below, we\nconclude that a reasonable jury could find that the Defendant actually\nknew of, or was willfully blind to, the involvement of the U.S. entity\nin the transactions conducted in 1994-1996.26 Such a conclusion\nwould by itself support a conviction for conspiracy, as it is not\nnecessary for the government to prove anything related to the latter\n\n\nCanada and in the United Kingdom to halt all such transactions in\ndeference to the United States embargo.” Brief of Appellee at 12. As\nexplained above, we do not review any evidence in the defense case\nin assessing the propriety of the judgment of acquittal. However, we\ntake note of this footnote and of the fact (revealed to us by the\ngovernment) that the Brodies and The Bro-Tech Corporation have\npending a legal malpractice action against Morgan, Lewis & Bockius\nLLP, to stress that we appreciate the broad context of this case, but do\nnot deem it relevant to the present decision.\n        26\n         The District Court also recognized that the evidence\n“establishe[d] that [the Defendant] did know that it was illegal for the\nU.S. company to be involved in sales to Cuba.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n417. The District Court further reasoned that “[i]f there were\nevidence ... that [the Defendant] knew about the involvement of the\nU.S. company in some of the sales from 1994 through 1996, the\nCourt will assume that a rational jury could find that he knowingly\nand willfully joined the conspiracy.” Id. at 417. The District Court\nfound insufficient evidence to support the inference of such\nknowledge; examining the same evidence, however, we find it\nsufficient to support that critical inference.\n\n                                  53\n\ftime period. However, we also conclude that a reasonable juror could\nconclude on the evidence that the Defendant knew or was willfully\nblind to the fact that the U.S. entity was still involved (albeit to a\nmuch lesser degree) in the transactions that occurred in the latter time\nframe.27 We now explore how these conclusions may be reached on\nthe evidence as a whole.\n\n        C.      The Evidence as a Whole\n\n        We will by necessity segregate our discussion in terms of the\nsix key pieces of evidence identified above, but one should not miss\nthe forest for the trees. The inferences against the Defendant urged\nby the government depend for their reasonableness on viewing the\nevidence as a whole, and while the Defendant disputes the existence\nof nearly every tree, we conclude that a reasonable jury could find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant did conspire to violate\nthe American Cuban embargo.\n\n        1.      Basic company structure\n\n        We begin with the evidence related to the basic structure of\nThe Bro-Tech Corporation d/b/a/ The Purolite Company, not because\nit was the most critical, but because a rational jury could legitimately\nuse it as a prism through which to assess all of the other\ncircumstantial evidence presented against the Defendant in this case.\n\n        27\n          Additionally, although the government urges the inference\nthat the Defendant actually knew of the participation of the U.S.\nentity in the transactions conducted by the U.K. entity and we find\nthat inference reasonable, we believe that a rational jury might also\nconclude from the evidence as a whole that the Defendant’s actions\nbelie a good faith belief in the legality of the “trading though the U.K.\nis ok” policy which he espoused as the basis for his defense.\n\n                                   54\n\fWe believe, moreover, that this evidence is particularly revealing\nwhen considered under the willful blindness instruction given by the\nDistrict Court.\n\n         From the facts related to the basic company structure, the\ngovernment urged an inference that the Defendant, as President of\nThe Bro-Tech Corporation, knew that the sales involving Cuba were\noccurring and critically, that they involved the U.S. entity, or was at\nthe very least willfully blind to that fact. The District Court was\n“very reluctant in a criminal conspiracy case, where the required\nmental state is knowledge and willfulness, to give any weight to these\npoints,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 420, and moreover, took explicit note of\ntestimony elicited on cross-examination that, during the period of the\ncharged conspiracy, the Defendant “spent 70-80% of his time out of\nthe country opening plants in Romania and China.” Id. We\nconclude, however, that the District Court usurped the role of the jury\nin its handling of this evidence.\n\n         In our view, it would be reasonable for a jury to give weight\n– indeed, substantial weight – to the fact that the Defendant was the\nPresident of The Bro-Tech Corporation; this, in turn, would support\nthe critical inference that he knew of the sales to Cuba and of the U.S.\nentity’s involvement therein. This inference is only strengthened\nwhen other basic facts pertaining to the corporate structure are added\ninto the mix. While The Bro-Tech Corporation had offices and\noperations in various parts of the world, it was not a large company\nas evidenced by the fact that its main office was housed on one floor\nof a suburban Pennsylvania office building and that the men most\nintimately involved in the prohibited sales – Don Brodie and later,\nMr. Sabzali – had their offices in that building in close proximity to\nthe Defendant’s office. The illegal sales to Cuba, moreover, which\ngrossed approximately $2.1 million, were not so minuscule as to\nreasonably escape the notice of the company’s president. Finally, the\n\n\n                                  55\n\ftestimony tended to paint the Defendant as an active participant in\ncompany affairs, not as a corporate figurehead whom a jury might\nmore readily infer was ignorant of the actions of his fellow officers\nand subordinates.\n\n         A rational jury, moreover, could legitimately consider the\nrelationship between the Brodies in drawing reasonable inferences\nabout the Defendant’s knowledge and intent. While guilt for\nconspiracy cannot be proven solely by familial relationships, see e.g.,\nUnited States v.

Given the fact that this same evidence portrays the\nDefendant as an active participant in his company’s affairs (he was,\nafter all, out of the office actively pursuing business on behalf of his\ncompany), a juror might reasonably infer that he was not completely\ndisconnected from events concerning his company, even while\nphysically absent from his office. The weight and relevance of such\nevidence is to be assessed by the jury; it is not to be deemed of\noverriding importance by the court.\n\n       2.      The billing instruction, audit and related events\n\n        The government and the defense each had their own theory as\nto what the series of events concerning the 1992 Galax transaction\nand the audit revealed about the state of the Defendant’s knowledge\nof the illegality of the sales to Cuba and of the U.S. entity’s\ninvolvement therein. The basic thrust of the government’s theory was\nthat, as revealed by the billing instruction, the Defendant already\nknew about the 1992 Galax transaction before it was brought to his\nattention by the auditors and that his actions related to the billing\ninstruction and the audit in the period of 1992 and 1993 reveal two\nthings: one, that he was attempting to conceal his knowledge of any\nand all Cuba-related transactions that had already occurred and of the\nU.S. entity’s involvement therein, and two, that he expected and\nintended future transactions to occur. This global inference is tied to\na series of interconnected supporting inferences, each of which we\nbelieve a rational jury could make on the evidence presented.\n\n\n\n                                  57\n\f         The first major supporting inference is tied to the billing\ninstruction. The District Court, noting that Mr. Grossman testified\nthat the billing instruction was given before the events of the audit,\nconcluded that a “permissible inference from [Mr. Grossman’s]\ntestimony is that [the Defendant] gave the instructions he did to Mr.\nGrossman to conceal sales to Cuba.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 418. We\nagree, and further believe that a rational jury who concludes that the\nbilling instruction was given in 1992 could also infer therefrom that\nthe Defendant desired those sales to continue. In our view, a rational\njury viewing the evidence as a whole could conclude that it was this\naction by the Defendant which dictated how sales to Cuba were\nhandled by the company in the 1994-1996 time-frame before the\ninvestigation began. At the very least this evidence suggests that the\nDefendant was willfully blind to the actions of the U.S. entity in the\n1994-1996 period.\n\n        The second major supporting inference is tied to the events\nconcerning the audit. While the District Court did not specifically\nexplain why it rejected the government’s inferences from this\nevidence, we conclude that it must have done so and did so\nimproperly. A rational jury, especially one that has already indulged\na negative inference against the Defendant in relation to the 1992\nbilling instruction, could infer that the Defendant (1) feigned\nignorance to the auditor who discovered the Galax sale in 1993; (2)\ndeliberately characterized Mr. Sabzali as a new employee (when he\nknew differently28) and initially resisted the need for a legal opinion\n\n       28\n          The District Court, finding “no evidence that Mr. Sabzali\nhad been with the company since 1990,” emphatically rejected any\ninference that the Defendant lied or somehow misrepresented the\ntruth to the auditors in 1993 when he characterized Mr. Sabzali as a\n“new” employee. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 418 n.6. Such evidence is\nin the record however. Mr. Grossman testified on direct examination\n\n                                  58\n\fon the effect of the Galax transaction, both in an effort to downplay\nthe significance of the transaction; and (3) fired the auditors who\ndiscovered the Galax transaction, not out of dissatisfaction with their\nservices, but rather because of their knowledge of that transaction. A\njury that has indulged these reasonable inferences could also infer that\nthe Defendant knew the U.S. entity was violating the law and was\ntaking steps to ensure that future transactions would go unquestioned.\n\n        The third major supporting inference is tied to the future\npolicy memorandum, which purported to set forth company policy\nregarding future sales to Cuba. This document was key to the both\nsides’ theory of the case. The government urged one of two\ncharacterizations – either the document was a “sham” in that it was\n\n\nthat, by the time Mr. Grossman began his employment with the\ncompany in January 1991, Mr. Sabzali was already working in the\nCanada office. Additionally, the following exchange occurred during\nthe cross-examination of Ms. Graves:\n\n       Q:      ... From about 1990 until 1996, Mr. Sabzali\n               was the sales manager at the Purolite Canada\n               office, is that correct?\n\n       A:      Yes.\n\nA. 906 (Graves, cross-examination). If a jury found on the basis of\nthis evidence that Mr. Sabzali had been with the company since at\nleast 1990, it would be no leap to infer that the Defendant, as an\nactive participant in company affairs, knew that Mr. Sabzali was not\na “new” employee but deliberately characterized him as such to\ndownplay the significance of the uncovered Galax transaction (in\nother words, to perhaps insinuate that Mr. Sabzali did not know any\nbetter and the illegal transaction would not reoccur).\n\n                                  59\n\fshown to the auditors but not actually issued to the salesman, or it\nwas “window-dressing” – i.e., a policy statement to which the\ncompany could point while simultaneously engaging in transactions\nwith Cuba with the participation of the U.S. entity. The defense, on\nthe other hand, pointed to the future policy memorandum as setting\nforth the Defendant’s good-faith belief that the U.K. entity could\ntrade with Cuba so long as the U.S. entity was not involved, and as\nevidence that, far from violating the law, he was trying to abide by\nit.29 The District Court rejected the sham characterization, see 268 F.\nSupp. 2d at 418, and we agree there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport it. The District Court also rejected the window-dressing\ncharacterization, and it is here that we part company.\n\n        Attempting to understand the testimony related to the 1992\nbilling instruction in light of the future policy memorandum, the\n\n       29\n          We believe that the text of the future policy memorandum\nreasonably could be viewed by a jury as refuting the Defendant’s\nclaim that he did not know it was illegal to ship Purolite product from\nthe U.K. entity. It provides, in pertinent part: “While it is proper to\nship this order from the UK in terms of UK law, it is contrary to USA\npolicy and law to ship material of any kind to the island nation of\nCuba in violation of the US embargo. ... No shipment of Purolite\nmerchandise is to be shipped to, redirected to, or trans-shipped to\nCuba.”(emphasis added). The term “transship” means “to transfer for\nfurther transportation from one ship or conveyance to another.”\nWEBSTER ’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (G. & C.\nMerriam Co. 1981). One could infer that shipments of Purolite\nproduct, to the extent they were physically shipped from the U.K.\nentity but otherwise handled in some manner by the U.S. entity (i.e.,\nthrough sales, processing, etc.), were “transshipped” and hence under\nthe proscription of both the future policy memorandum and the\nAmerican Cuban embargo.\n\n                                  60\n\fDistrict Court appears to have viewed the latter as establishing a “new\npolicy with respect to Cuba” – i.e., one that would counteract the\n1992 billing instruction. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 418. Further, the District\nCourt concluded there was “simply no evidence to support” the\nwindow-dressing characterization, and that “[t]he fact that during the\nperiod 1994 through 1996, there were sales to Cuba that at times\ninvolved the United States is not evidence that the [D]efendant\nintended the memorandum as a cover when there is not other\nevidence that he knew about the sales. Nor was there any evidence\nthat [the Defendant] or anyone else followed up the memorandum\nwith either written or oral instructions that it was to be ignored.” Id.\nIn our view, however, a rational jury viewing the evidence as a whole\ncould draw the inference that the future policy memorandum was\nwindow dressing.\n\n        The window dressing inference depends for its reasonableness\non all of the evidence put forth by the government in its case against\nthe Defendant. It is not a strong inference, but a jury that has\nindulged adverse inferences against the Defendant related to the basic\nfacts of the company, the billing instruction and the events of the\naudit (as well as from the “our friends in the Caribbean speech,” the\nSabzali performance review, the use of code words, and the post-\ninvestigation events, all of which we examine below), it would not be\nunreasonable to further infer that the future policy memorandum was\nintended to put a public face on a behind-the-scenes agreement by the\nprincipal actors to pursue sales to Cuba in violation of a known\nprohibition. While the District Court placed significant emphasis on\nMr. Grossman’s cross-examination testimony, such presented\nGrossman’s understanding of the future policy memorandum; it\nwould be up to the jury to square his testimony with all of the other\nevidence in determining if Grossman’s understanding could be said\nto reflect the Defendant’s intent. To our mind, there are a number of\nways to read Mr. Grossman’s testimony; to conclude that it may be\n\n\n                                  61\n\fread only to negate a finding of intent by the Defendant is to overstep\nthe judicial role. The court’s obligation in the context of\nFed.R.Crim.P. 29 is to ensure that any inferences arising from\ncircumstantial evidence are reasonable, and we believe the window\ndressing inference is that.\n\n       3.      The “Our friends in the Caribbean” speech\n\n        Each side urged a different inference from the incident in\nwhich Mr. Sabzali, following a whispered comment by the Defendant\nduring a sales presentation, substituted a reference to “the Caribbean”\nin place of his previous reference to Cuba. The government offered\nthis evidence to show the Defendant engaged in an act of concealment\nfrom which one could infer guilty knowledge. The defense countered\nthat any adverse inferences were unreasonable given the uncertainly\nas to what the Defendant said to Mr. Sabzali and when the incident\noccurred. Instead, the defense urged an inference that the event, if it\noccurred in 1993 (i.e., after the issuance of the future policy\nmemorandum), merely showed the Defendant trying to comply with\nthe law as he understood it and had directed it be followed in the\nfuture policy memorandum. The District Court rejected the\ninferences favored by either side as illogical, and moreover, deemed\nthem both speculative due to the uncertainty of the Defendant’s\nstatement, his motive in speaking to Mr. Sabzali, and the date of the\nincident. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 419.\n\n        The District Court’s handling of this circumstantial evidence,\nwhich we believe a rational jury could view as particularly strong\nagainst the Defendant, again invaded the province of the jury. While\none does not know exactly what the Defendant said to Mr. Sabzali,\na rational jury could reasonably infer the content of that statement\nbased on the reaction of both men. A rational jury viewing the\nevidence as a whole could also draw a reasonable adverse inference\n\n\n                                  62\n\fas to the Defendant’s motive in speaking to his subordinate. Such\ninferences are not merely speculative, but have a logical and\nconvincing connection.\n\n         Additionally, the weight and value of this evidence should not\nhave been discounted due to uncertainty over when the incident\noccurred. A rational juror, by choosing to believe Mr. Gentile’s\ntestimony as given at trial or as given before the grand jury (and\nreferenced during cross-examination at trial), could have accepted\nthat this event occurred in 1992 before the audit and related events or\nin 1993 after the issuance of the future policy memorandum.\nCritically, we believe that an inference of concealment would be\nreasonable in conjunction with either date when put in the context of\nthe evidence as a whole. Furthermore, the inference of concealment\nbecomes even more reasonable when Mr. Sabzali’s use of\n“Caribbean” during this incident – as apparently prompted by the\nDefendant30 – is considered in light of the fact that many other\nemployees of The Bro-Tech Company, at the time of the speech or\nlater, understood “Caribbean” to be a code word for Cuba.\n\n        4.      Mr. Sabzali’s performance review\n\n        The government urged a number of related inferences from\nthe evidence of Mr. Sabzali’s performance review and promotion –\nmainly, that the Defendant was aware of and approved of Mr.\nSabzali’s sales to Cuba, wanted to reward him for those sales, and\n\n        30\n          We are not ourselves usurping the jury’s role by insinuating\nthat the Defendant actually told Mr. Sabzali during the whispered\nconversation to use the term Caribbean; we are merely suggesting that\na rational juror could so infer or at least infer that the Defendant said\nsomething less direct but equally meaningful to Mr. Sabzali, who then\nhimself chose the term Caribbean.\n\n                                   63\n\fwanted such sales to continue as evidenced by the fact that, despite\nbeing promoted to a marketing position, Mr. Sabzali was to continue\nhandling “the Caribbean sales.” The defense pointed to testimony in\nthe government’s case tending to undercut the reasonableness of such\ninferences – mainly, that Don Brodie, not the Defendant, was in\ncharge of North American affairs, thus making it more reasonable to\ninfer that Don alone was responsible for Mr. Sabzali’s promotion, and\nthat Mr. Opperman was promoted by the Defendant to an\ninternational position, thus making it unreasonable to infer that the\nDefendant had a hand in a North American-related promotion like\nMr. Sabzali’s. In ruling on the motion for acquittal, the District Court\nacknowledged that a rational juror could conclude that the reference\nto “Caribbean” in the performance review meant Cuba, and that the\nDefendant read the performance review, saw the reference and knew\ntherefrom that The Bro-Tech Corporation was selling product to\nCuba. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 419. However, the District Court rejected\nany inference that the Defendant also knew, as a result, that the U.S.\nentity (as opposed to solely the U.K. entity) was actually involved in\nthose sales. See id.\n\n        We agree that the evidence related to Mr. Sabzali’s\nperformance review would support the inferences identified by the\nDistrict Court, but believe there are additional ones that might be\ndrawn by a rational jury from the evidence as a whole. Specifically,\nwe believe a jury could reasonably infer that the Defendant not only\nread the performance review, but approved of the underlying\npromotion, knew it was based on Mr. Sabzali’s success in transacting\nbusiness with Cuba, and intended to reward and thereby incentivize\nsuch sales in the future. We further part company with the District\nCourt in terms of what this evidence may suggest about the\nDefendant’s knowledge of the involvement of the U.S. entity in such\nsales. As all the evidence suggests that Mr. Sabzali was a star\nsalesman in “the Caribbean,” it would be not be an impermissible\n\n\n                                  64\n\fleap to infer that an involved president of the company would know\nwhy that was so and how it was occurring.\n\n        5.      Use of code words\n\n         The government evidence shows a corporate culture pervaded\nby the use of code words for Cuba, and such naturally gives rise to an\ninference of concealment. See Macko, 994 F.2d at 1535 (“The one\naspect of the operation that they kept secret was the Cuban\nconnection. A jury could reasonably conclude that the defendants’\nsecrecy about this single fact resulted from their knowledge of the\nCuban embargo”). Importantly, the use of code words was attributed\nat least twice to the Defendant. First, in issuing the billing instruction\nto Mr. Grossman (whether that occurred in 1992 or 1993, after or in\nconjunction with the events of the audit), the Defendant asked Mr.\nGrossman to instruct the billing department not to include any\nreference to Cuba on the face of future invoices, and that instruction\nwas given. A jury could reasonable conclude that this instruction\neither instigated or at least contributed to an overall corporate culture\nof deceit concerning transactions with Cuba. Second, it was the\nDefendant whose actions before a room of subordinate salesmen\nappear to have prompted Mr. Sabzali to refer to “Caribbean” instead\nof to Cuba. Again, we believe that a rational jury could conclude that\nthe Defendant’s reaction to Mr. Sabzali’s use of the word Cuba either\ninstigated or at least attributed to the overall corporate culture of\ndeceit. Both were actions of the company’s president, not some low-\nlevel employee whose behavior might be less influential. The use of\ncode words, when viewed in conjunction with the other evidence in\nthis case, tends to strengthen the overall inference that the Defendant\nwas a knowing and willful participant in the conspiracy to trade with\nCuba and understood that the U.S. entity was involved.\n\n\n\n\n                                   65\n\f        In an attempt to undermine the rationality of any adverse\ninference from the use of code words, the defense pointed to the fact\nthat there was, simultaneously, rather open use of “Cuba” or\n“Havana” in company memorandum, sales documents and expense\nreports. There was also testimony elicited on cross-examination from\na former product manager for The Purolite Company to the effect that\nhe asked Mr. Sabzali not to use the word Cuba on anything sent to\nhim. Finally, there was testimony from Mr. Grossman that The Bro-\nTech Corporation had other customers in the Caribbean, although he\ncould only recall one. Again, this evidence does tend to weaken the\ninference of concealment, but critically, does not render it completely\nunreasonable. The weight to be assigned the use of code words in\nthis prosecution on circumstantial evidence is for the jury.\n\n       6.      Post-investigation events\n\n        The government urged that the Sabzali memorandum of\nFebruary 28, 1997, showed that transactions involving Cuba\nconducted before the Customs agents’ visit a few weeks prior\ninvolved the U.S. entity. In other words, there would be no need to\nexplain in that memorandum “we now have to ship products from\nU.K.” if such had already been the procedure. Similarly, there would\nbe no need to explain that invoicing to the “customer in the\nCaribbean” would now be done directly “from Ponty” unless prior\nprocedure had involved the U.S. entity. This memo was not carbon\ncopied to the Defendant, but the government contended that a\nreasonable juror viewing the evidence as a whole could infer the\nDefendant’s knowledge of its underlying premise (i.e., that sales\nbefore the investigation were conducted with the participation of the\nU.S. entity). From the fact that the Defendant was carbon-copied on\nMr. Sabzali’s February 28, 1997 and March 3, 1997 memoranda, the\ngovernment urged an inference that the Defendant read these\ndocuments and thereby knew of the continued participation of the\n\n\n                                  66\n\fU.S. entity in the sales occurring in early 1997 from the fact that Mr.\nSabzali was now directing sales in “the Caribbean” from his office in\nBala Cynwyd. The participation of the U.S. entity was certainly less\n(or at least on the decline) at this point, but as evidenced by these\nmemoranda, still involved the U.S. entity’s Bala Cynwyd office. The\nDistrict Court never addressed whether any reasonable inferences\nagainst the Defendant arise from this evidence, having merely noted\nin a footnote the existence of the two memoranda carbon copied to\nthe Defendant. Again, however, we believe that a rational jury\nviewing the evidence as a whole could use them to draw adverse\ninferences against the Defendant.\n\n        From the evidence of the Defendant’s phone call to Ms.\nGraves, the government urged an inference of concealment and\ntherefore of knowledge of past wrongdoing. The defense sought to\nundercut any adverse inference by noting a lack of evidence to\nsuggest that the Defendant knew Ms. Graves would be interviewed\nby the government again and by urging that the critical statement – “if\nyou can’t remember the name, then you don’t have anything to tell\nthem” – be taken at face value as merely an innocent observation. In\nruling on the motion, the District Court acknowledged that the\ngovernment’s inference as to the call to Ms. Graves was a “fair one,”\nbut ultimately assigned it no value, reasoning: “[This] inference does\nnot shed any light on whether the defendant knew about the 1994 to\n1996 shipments before or at the time they were occurring. This\nconversation took place two years after the government had started its\ninvestigation. [The Defendant] surely would have known about the\nshipments at that point ...” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 419. We agree that an\ninference of concealment is reasonable and further conclude that a\nrational jury viewing the evidence as a whole could further infer, as\nthe impetus for the act of calling Ms. Graves, that the Defendant\nknew of the illegal sales activity during the relevant time frame. It is\njust as reasonable (if not more so) to infer that the Defendant was\n\n\n                                  67\n\fseeking to conceal illegal activity involving the U.S. entity that\npredated the investigation of which he knew at the time he called Ms.\nGraves than it is to conclude he was seeking to conceal acts which he\nnow understood to have been illegal. The mere fact that he chose to\ncontact Ms. Graves in 1999 – a woman who, by virtue of her former\nposition as a customer sales representative processing orders, might\nhave seen orders involving transactions with Cuba – is itself\nimportant. Moreover, a rational jury viewing the evidence as a whole\ncould certainly decline to interpret the Defendant’s advice to Ms.\nGraves as benign, and instead view it as another instance of the\nDefendant attempting to conceal the Cuban transactions.\n\n         The government also urged an inference of concealment from\nthe Defendant’s reaction to Mr. Lugo’s visit to the U.S. embassy.\nThe District Court stated unequivocally that “a rational juror could\nnot make a negative inference here” because “[t]he defendant was\ntelling an employee to let him know if he is called in again to the U.S.\nEmbassy because of a concern ‘that U.S. officials would be asking\n[Lugo] questions without company counsel present.’” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 419-20 (emphasis added, brackets in the original). See also id.\nat 420 (“The Lugo discussion adds very little, if anything, to the\ngovernment’s case.”). We acknowledge the uncertainty on the record\nabout the timing of Mr. Lugo’s visit to the embassy and whether the\nDefendant relayed his reaction thereto directly to Mr. Lugo, or\nthrough Mr. Sabzali. For present purposes, however, it is the reaction\nitself, coming sometime after the investigation was underway and\npresumably known to the Defendant, that is the key to the inference\nof concealment. A rational jury viewing the evidence as a whole need\nnot have accepted the Defendant’s explanation that the instruction to\nMr. Lugo was borne solely of a concern with having counsel present.\nInstead, one could reasonably conclude that, like the veiled\ninstruction given to Ms. Graves, the instruction to Mr. Lugo was\nmotivated by a desire to conceal past wrongdoing.\n\n\n                                  68\n\f       D.      Willful Blindness\n\n         As explained above, we are satisfied that a reasonable jury\ncould conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant had\nactual knowledge of the law violated, the facts constituting the\noffense and the illicit purpose of the conspiracy. We also conclude\nthat a reasonable jury could find the knowledge requirements of the\ncrime met on a theory of willful blindness. Overall, the government’s\nevidence paints a convincing picture of the Defendant as a company\npresident who deliberately stuck his head in the sand regarding the\ninvolvement of the U.S. entity in the prohibited transactions. In\nparticular, the evidence related to the billing instruction could be\nviewed as the Defendant trying to ensure that he never saw a direct\nreference to Cuba again, despite intending the transactions to\ncontinue. The corporate culture wherein Cuba was referred to by\n“code words,” which a reasonable jury could attribute at least in part\nto the conduct of the Defendant, only aided him in his effort to ignore\nwhat should have been obvious. And while the Defendant repeatedly\nargues that the future policy memorandum and the events of the audit\nshow him trying to discern and comply with the law, a jury might\nreasonably take note of the Defendant’s failure to ask the “natural\nfollow-up question[s]” when, for example, he did not question the\nreference to “Caribbean” on Mr. Sabzali’s performance review, and\nnever instigated any follow-up to the events of the 1992 audit report\n(as he suggested to Mr. Coulter that he would) or to his own\ninstruction in the future policy memorandum, to ensure that his\ncompany was not transacting business with SDNs or with Cuba. See\nWert-Ruiz, 228 F.3d at 257 (stating, in context of conviction for\nmoney laundering, that “the fact that [defendant] did not ask the\nnatural follow-up question to determine the source of those funds\ncould be reasonably considered by a jury to be evidence of willful\nblindness, especially when combined with the additional evidence”).\nThe basic facts of the company structure also strengthen the willful\n\n\n                                  69\n\fblindness inference in that it would not be unreasonable for a jury to\ninfer that the Defendant was motivated to deliberately avoid learning\nthe facts related to his company’s trade with Cuba due to its\nprofitability or his brother’s involvement. As in Stewart, where this\nCourt concluded that a jury could have found that a defendant former\nlaw partner, who argued that he lacked the intent to defraud since he\nrelied on solvency findings by third-party investigators, “could have\nrecognized the likelihood of insolvency yet deliberately avoided\nlearning the true facts,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we conclude that the Defendant\nin this case could have recognized the likelihood that the U.S. entity\nwas involved in illegal transactions with Cuba “yet deliberately\navoided learning the true facts.”\n\n                        IV. CONCLUSION\n\n       Deciding a motion for judgment of acquittal in a conspiracy\ncase built entirely on circumstantial evidence is not an easy task, and\nwas made all the more difficult in this case by the complexities of the\nunderlying substantive law and voluminous record. Nonetheless, we\nconclude that because each of the interconnected inferences urged by\nthe government is reasonable on the evidence as a whole, the District\nCourt erred in entering the judgment of acquittal, and accordingly we\n\n\n\n\n                                  70\n\fwill vacate that judgment and reinstate the jury verdict subject to the\nDistrict Court’s conditional grant of a new trial.31\n\n\n\n\n        31\n          Where a defendant has been acquitted on the ground of\ninsufficient evidence to support the conviction, and this Court vacates\nthe judgment of acquittal, the proper procedure is to reinstate the jury\nverdict. See Coleman, 811 F.2d at 805; United States v. Dixon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"393831\"><a href=\"/opinion/393831/united-states-v-dixon-john-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">658</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1981). We do so here, although we recognize that\nthe District Court has already granted the Defendant a new trial\npending the outcome of this appeal. If the Defendant is retried\nfollowing our reinstatement of the verdict, “it will be the result of his\nown motion for a new trial, and not a process imposed upon him by\nthe Government or this court,” Dixon, 658 F.2d at 187, and thus there\nwill be no issue of double jeopardy.\n\n                                   71\n\f</pre>",
