Berman, for Plaintiffs\nand Respondents.\n\n\n                   __________________________________________\n\f      In the underlying action, respondents Jacquelyn A. Heebner, trustee of the\nRoger Williams Trust, and Virtuoso, Inc. (Virtuoso) assert claims against appellant\nWilliam Prappas for violations of a tax preparer’s statutory duties. On appeal,\nPrappas challenges the trial court’s denial of his motion under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 425.16 -- the law designed to curtail the filing of strategic\nlawsuits against public participation, often called the “anti-SLAPP law.” We\naffirm.\n\n\n       RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Virtuoso is a closely held corporation established by Roger Williams, the\nwell known pianist and performer. In 1996, Williams also created a personal trust,\nwhich was later amended and restated. For several years, Prappas acted as\nbusiness manager for Williams and Virtuoso. In October 2011, Williams died.\n      In February 2012, Williams’ daughter, Alice Williams Jung, initiated a\nprobate action to invalidate certain testamentary instruments attributed to\nWilliams, and remove Heebner as trustee of Williams’s trust (L.A.S.C. Case No.\nBP 133277). Jung’s petition alleged that several instruments executed by\nWilliams, including amendments to the trust naming Heebner as trustee, were the\nproduct of “fraud, menace, forgery, duress [and] undue influence” by Heebner.\nJung’s petition sought the appointment of Prappas as trustee of the trust.\n      On March 9, 2012, Heebner filed a probate action in her alleged capacity as\nthe trustee of Williams’s trust (L.A.S.C. Case No. BP 133540). Her petition\nasserted that Williams and Virtuoso had assigned certain items of property to the\ntrust, including business and tax records; that Prappas possessed some or all the\nproperty; and that Prappas failed to return the property when Heebner asked for it.\nHeebner requested a determination that the property belonged to the trust, and an\norder directing Prappas to return the property.\n\n                                          2\n\f          On March 16, 2012, Jung filed an action for damages against Heebner and\nseveral other parties, asserting a cause of action for elder abuse and related claims\n(L.A.S.C. Case No. BC 481134).1 Jung’s complaint alleged that in 2011, when\nWilliams underwent debilitating treatment for pancreatic cancer, Heebner\nimproperly arranged for him to execute testamentary instruments favorable to her,\nand engaged in other misconduct.\n          In April 2012, the probate court judge consolidated the two probate actions.\nLater, in July 2012, Jung’s action for damages was declared related to the two\nprobate actions, and all three actions were assigned to a single probate court judge\n(Judge Michael Levanas).\n          On September 14, 2012, respondents initiated the underlying action against\nPrappas (L.A.S.C. Case No. BC 492111).2 The complaint alleges that prior to\nWilliams’s death, he and Virtuoso paid Prappas to prepare and file tax returns for\nthem. The complaint contains claims for unfair business practices and violations\nof the duties imposed on tax preparers (Bus. & Prof. Code, §§ 17200, 22250 et\nseq.).3\n          Prappas filed a motion under the anti-SLAPP law to strike respondents’\ncomplaint. In addition, he demurred to the complaint, contending that it stated no\ncause of action, and that respondents’ action should be abated due to the three prior\n\n\n\n1      Jung’s complaint also contained claims for willful misconduct, negligence,\nnegligent misrepresentation, fraud, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to\ndefraud, infliction of emotional distress, wrongful death, recovery on common counts,\nand imposition of a constructive trust.\n2     The claims in the complaint are asserted against Prappas individually and as doing\nbusiness as The Prappas Company.\n3     All further statutory citations are to the Business and Professions Code, unless\notherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\factions. In January 2013, the underlying action was declared related to those\nactions and assigned to the probate court responsible for them.\n      On March 20, 2013, the probate court judge denied the anti-SLAPP motion,\nand determined that respondents were entitled to an award of attorney fees. In\naddition, the judge overruled Prappas’s demurrer to the complaint. Later, the judge\ndenied Prappas’s motion for reconsideration of those rulings. This appeal\nfollowed.4\n\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n      Prappas contends the probate court judge erred in denying his anti-SLAPP\nmotion and issuing an award of attorney fees to respondents. For the reasons\ndiscussed below, we disagree.\n\n\n      A. Anti-SLAPP Motions\n      Under section 425.16 of the Code of Civil Procedure, “[w]hen a lawsuit\narises out of the exercise of free speech or petition, a defendant may move to strike\nthe complaint. [Citations.] The complaint is subject to dismissal unless the\nplaintiff establishes ‘a probability that [he or she] will prevail on the claim.’\n[Citations.]” (Beilenson v. Superior Court (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 944, 949,\nquoting Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b).) The anti-SLAPP law encompasses\nactions arising from conduct “in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional\nright of petition or the constitutional right of free speech,” including written and\noral statements “before a . . . judicial proceeding” or “in connection with an issue\n\n4      Prappas noticed the appeal, inter alia, from the denial of his anti-SLAPP motion\nand demurrer. On August 8, 2013, this court dismissed the appeal to the extent Prappas\nchallenged the denial of his demurrer, which is not an appealable order. (San Diego Gas\n& Electric Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 13 Cal.4th 893, 912-913.)\n\n\n                                            4\n\funder consideration or review by . . . a judicial body.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16,\nsubd. (e)(1).) Under the anti-SLAPP law, oral and written statements that are\n“intimately intertwined with, and preparatory to, the filing of judicial proceedings”\nmay constitute protected activity. (Cabral v. Martin (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 471,\n482.)\n        Resolution of an anti-SLAPP motion “requires the court to engage in a two-\nstep process. First, the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold\nshowing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected\nactivity. . . . If the court finds such a showing has been made, it then determines\nwhether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.”\n(Equilon Enterprises v. Consumer Cause, Inc. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 53, 67.) When an\nanti-SLAPP motion attacks several claims within a complaint, this process is\nproperly applied to individual claims. (Mann v. Quality Old Time Service, Inc.\n(2004) 120 Cal.App.4th 90, 106-110; Kajima Engineering & Construction, Inc. v.\nCity of Los Angeles (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 921, 929-935; Shekhter v. Financial\nIndemnity Co. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 141, 150 (Shekhter).)\n        “‘The defendant has the burden on the first issue, the threshold issue; the\nplaintiff has the burden on the second issue. [Citation.]’. . . In terms of the so-\ncalled threshold issue, the moving defendant’s burden is to show the challenged\ncause of action ‘arises’ from protected activity. [Citations.] Once it is\ndemonstrated the cause of action arises from the exercise of the defendant’s free\nexpression or petition rights, then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a\nprobability of prevailing in the litigation. . . . [T]he trial court, in making its\ndetermination, considers the pleadings and affidavits stating the facts upon which\nthe liability or defense is based. [Citations].” (Shekhter, supra, 89 Cal.App.4th at\np. 151, italics omitted.) We review the trial court’s determinations regarding those\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\fmatters de novo. (Governor Gray Davis Com. v. American Taxpayers Alliance\n(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 449, 456.)\n      Under the anti-SLAPP statute, the trial court must award reasonable attorney\nfees to a prevailing plaintiff pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5,\nwhen it determines that a defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion was “frivolous or\n. . . solely intended to cause unnecessary delay” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd.\n(c)(1)). (Gerbosi v. Gaims, Weil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th\n435, 450.) An award of attorney fees to a prevailing defendant is reviewed for an\nabuse of discretion. (Ibid.)\n      Our review is governed by a fundamental principle of appellate procedure,\nnamely, that “‘[a] judgment or order of the lower court is presumed correct,’” and\nthus, “‘error must be affirmatively shown.’” (Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2\nCal.3d 557, 564, italics omitted, quoting 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedures (1954) Appeal,\n§ 79, pp. 2238-2239.) Under this principle, Prappas bears the burden of\nestablishing error on appeal by means of argument and citation to authority.\n(Paulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 659, 684-685 (Paulus);\nSchoendorf v. U.D. Registry, Inc. (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 227, 237 (Schoendorf).)\nOur review is thus limited to contentions adequately raised in Prappas’s briefs.\n(Schoendorf, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at p. 237.)\n\n\n      B. Underlying Proceedings\n      Respondents’ complaint, filed September 14, 2012, contains ten claims for\nbreach of a tax preparer’s duties (§§ 22250, 22252, 22252.1, 22253, 22255), and a\nclaim for unfair business practices (§ 17200). In support of those claims, the\ncomplaint alleges that prior to Williams’s death, he and Virtuoso paid Prappas to\nprepare and file tax returns for them, but Prappas failed to comply with certain\nstatutory duties imposed on tax preparers. The complaint further alleges that after\n\n                                          6\n\fWilliams’s death, Prappas violated other statutory duties when he refused to return\ntax records to Heebner, and instead gave them to his attorney, James Armstrong,\nwho also represents Jung in the three prior actions regarding Williams and his\nestate. According to the complaint, attorney Armstrong disclosed the tax records\nto Jung, and used them in those actions. The complaint sought restitution,\ndisgorgement of profits, statutory fines, and an award of attorney fees; in addition,\nit maintained that Prappas’s misconduct constituted misdemeanors (§ 22256).\n      As we elaborate below (see pt. C.1., post), five of the complaint’s claims are\npredicated primarily on allegations that Prappas violated a tax preparer’s duties\nwhen he prepared and filed Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax returns. Of the\nremaining claims, five rely -- at least in part -- on allegations that Prappas\ncontravened a tax preparer’s duties after Williams’s death: two claims assert that\nPrappas failed to return respondents’ tax records when Heebner requested them,\nand three claims assert that Prappas improperly disclosed the records to third\nparties. The remaining claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) (Bus. &\nProf. Code, § 17200 et seq.) is predicated on the unlawful conduct alleged in the\nother claims, and seeks disgorgement of Prappas’s profits.\n      Upon filing the complaint, respondents submitted a notice identifying their\naction as related to the three prior actions regarding Williams and his estate. In\nresponse to that notice, the trial judge assigned to the action referred it to another\ncourt for a determination whether the action should be reassigned to the probate\ncourt judge responsible for the three prior actions.\n      On November 21, 2012, while that determination was pending, Prappas filed\nhis anti-SLAPP motion. Prappas contended that respondents’ claims arose from\nhis protected activities, arguing that the claims had “a direct and obvious\n‘connection’ with a judicial proceeding”-- namely, the three prior actions regarding\nWilliams and his estate -- and that respondents’ complaint was “nothing more than\n\n                                           7\n\fa ruse and guise to somehow circumvent, divert, and thwart” those actions.\nPrappas requested judicial notice of the entire case files and pleadings in the prior\nactions. Additionally, Prappas asserted that respondents’ claims were “factually\nand materially deficient.”\n      On January 16, 2013, respondents filed their opposition to the anti-SLAPP\nmotion.5 On the same date, Prappas submitted what he characterized as a reply to\nrespondents’ “non-opposition” to the anti-SLAPP motion, arguing that respondents\nhad failed to file and serve a timely opposition. In support of that contention, the\nreply relied on a declaration from attorney Armstrong. The reply also requested\nthat the court take judicial notice of the case files in the three prior actions.\n      The following day, January 17, 2013, respondents’ action was determined to\nbe related to the three prior actions, and was assigned to the probate court\nresponsible for them. Later, the probate court set a hearing regarding the anti-\nSLAPP motion, and permitted Prappas to file a reply to respondents’ opposition.\n      Prappas’s supplemental reply, filed February 7, 2013, again maintained that\nrespondents had failed to file and serve their opposition in a timely manner, relying\non a declaration from Armstrong. In addition, Prappas requested judicial notice of\nthe case files in the prior three actions, as well as all the filings in the underlying\naction. Prior to the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion, respondents objected to\nPrappas’s requests for judicial notice and portions of Armstrong’s declarations.\n\n\n\n5       Respondents opposed the motion on three grounds. First, they maintained that\ntheir claims did not implicate Prappas’s free speech or petition rights. Second, they\nargued that the misconduct alleged in the complaint was not protected activity under the\nexception stated in Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 320 (Flatley) for conduct that\nis “illegal as a matter of law.” Third, they contended that even if the claims arose from\nprotected activity, there was a reasonable probability that they would prevail on the\nmerits.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       On March 20, 2013, following a hearing, the probate court denied the anti-\nSLAPP motion. In ruling, the court rejected Prappas’s requests for judicial notice,\nand sustained all but one of respondents’ objections to Armstrong’s declarations.\nThe court determined that only three claims in respondents’ complaint “likely”\narose from “arguably” protected activity, and that respondents had established their\nlikelihood of prevailing with respect to those claims, which relied on allegations\nthat Prappas improperly disclosed Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax records. The\ncourt further concluded that respondents were entitled to an award of attorney fees,\nstating that Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion “was poorly drafted, poorly organized[,]\nand overwhelmingly without merit . . . .”\n\n\n       C. Analysis\n       In assessing the trial court’s rulings, our focus is on the ten claims alleging\nviolations of a tax preparer’s duties, as the unfair business practices claim relies\nentirely on the purported unlawful activity identified in those claims.6 In denying\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, the probate court effectively segregated the ten claims into\ntwo groups on the basis of whether they alleged an unlawful disclosure of\nconfidential information. The court concluded that the seven claims lacking such\nallegations (the disclosure-independent claims) implicated no protective activity,\nand that as to the three remaining disclosure-related claims, respondents had made\nan adequate showing of prevailing on the merits. As explained below, we discern\nno error in those determinations.\n\n\n6      Generally, the UCL defines “unfair competition” broadly to include “any\nunlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice . . . .” (Bus. & Prof. Code,\n§ 17200.) Under the UCL, damages cannot be recovered, and plaintiffs are generally\nlimited to injunctive relief and restitution. (Clark v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th\n605, 610.)\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f                 1. Disclosure-Independent Claims\n        We begin with the disclosure-independent claims. In determining whether\nthey “arise[] from protected activity” (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (b)), we\nexamine “the principal thrust or gravamen of the causes of action, i.e., the\nallegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct that provides the foundation for\nthe claims. [Citations.] We review the parties’ pleadings, declarations, and other\nsupporting documents at this stage of the analysis only ‘to determine what conduct\nis actually being challenged, not to determine whether the conduct is actionable.’”\n(Castleman v. Sagaser (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 481, 490-491, quoting Coretronic\nCorp. v. Cozen O’Connor (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1389 (Coretronic).)\n        None of the seven disclosure-independent claims is predicated on protected\nactivity. Five of those claims rely principally on allegations of Prappas’s\nmisconduct as a tax preparer before Williams’s death, when he prepared and filed\nWilliams’s and Virtuoso’s tax returns. Those claims assert that Prappas failed to\nsecure a bond (first cause of action; § 22250, subd. (e)(1)), failed to provide proof\nof a bond (second cause of action; § 22252), failed to register as a tax preparer\n(fourth cause of action; § 22253, subd. (a)(1)), failed to maintain copies of filed tax\nreturns (sixth cause of action; § 22253, subd. (a)(5), and failed to fulfill continuing\neducation requirements (tenth cause of action; § 22255, subd. (b)).7 As the\n\n\n7     Subdivision (e)(1) of section 22250 states: “A tax preparer may not conduct\nbusiness without having a current surety bond in the amount prescribed by this section.”\n       Section 22252 states: “Prior to rendering any tax preparation services, a tax\npreparer shall provide the customer in writing with the tax preparer's name, address,\ntelephone number, and evidence of compliance with the bonding requirement of Section\n22250, including the bond number, if any.”\n       Subdivision (a) of section 22253 states: “It is a violation of this chapter for a tax\npreparer to do or commit . . . any of the following: [¶] (1) Fail to register as a tax preparer\nwith the council. [¶] . . . [¶] (5) Fail to maintain a copy of any tax return prepared for a\n(Fn. continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                              10\n\fprincipal alleged misconduct predates Williams’s death and relates to Prappas’s\nconduct in preparing and filing Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax returns, it cannot be\nregarded as implicating Prappas’s free speech or petition rights. (See Beach v.\nHarco National Ins. Co. (2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 82, 92 [insured’s cause of action\nagainst insurer for bad faith in adjusting insured’s claim for policy benefits did not\narise from protected activity by insurer].)\n       The remaining two disclosure-independent claims also do not arise from\nprotected activity, even though they allege misconduct contemporaneous with the\nprior three actions. These claims assert that Prappas failed to return respondents’\ntax records, even when Heebner asked for them, both before and during the three\nprior actions (fifth and ninth causes of action; § 22253, subds. (a)(4), (a)(10)).8 As\nexplained below, the gravamen of the claims is the recovery of property, rather\nthan any protected activity.\n       In Episcopal Church Cases (2009) 45 Cal.4th 467, 474-476, a local church\nfell into a doctrinal disagreement with its national church and disaffiliated itself\nfrom that church, resulting in a property dispute regarding the local church’s\nbuilding. When the national church and its regional representative sued the local\nchurch to recover the building, the local church filed an anti-SLAPP motion,\n\ncustomer for four years from the date of completion or the due date of the return,\nwhichever is later.”\n       Subdivision (b) of section 22255 states: “A tax preparer shall complete on an\nannual basis not less than 20 hours of continuing education, including 15 hours in federal\ntaxation and 5 hours in California taxation from an approved curriculum provider.”\n8       Subdivision (a) of section 22253 states: “It is a violation of this chapter for a tax\npreparer to do or commit . . . any of the following: [¶] . . . [¶] (4) Fail or refuse to give a\ncustomer, for his or her own records, a copy of any document requiring the customer’s\nsignature, within a reasonable time after the customer signs the document. [¶] . . . [¶] (10)\nFail to return, upon the demand by or on behalf of a customer, records or other data\nprovided to the tax preparer by the customer.”\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\farguing that the suit arose from protected activity, namely, its right to assert a\nspecific religious doctrine. (Id. at pp. 476-477.) Our Supreme Court rejected that\ncontention, stating: “In filing this action, [the national church] sought to resolve a\nproperty dispute. The property dispute is based on the fact that both sides claim\nownership of the same property. This dispute, and not any protected activity, is\n‘the gravamen or principal thrust’ of the action. [Citation.] The additional fact\nthat protected activity may lurk in the background . . . does not transform a\nproperty dispute into a SLAPP suit.” (Id. at pp. 477-478, quoting Martinez v.\nMetabolife Internat., Inc. (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 181, 193.) The same is true here\nregarding the two claims in question.\n        Prappas contends that respondents’ claims necessarily arise from protected\nactivity because the underlying action was determined to be related to the three\nprior actions regarding Williams and his estate. He maintains that the\ncircumstances in the underlying action present “a classical example of why and\nwhen [an anti-SLAPP] motion should be granted,” arguing that all four actions\n“arise out of,” and involve, the same parties, facts, witnesses, and evidence. We\nreject his contention, as it relies on a false premise, namely, that the determination\nthat an action is related to prior litigation establishes that the claims in the action\narise from activity protected under the anti-SLAPP law.\n        Under the rules of court, as applicable here, actions may be declared related\nand assigned to a single judge when they involve claims or issues based on the\nsame transactions, incidents, or events.9 The goals of those rules are “to promote\n\n\n9      Rule 3.300(a) of the California Rules of Court states: “A pending civil case is\nrelated to another pending civil case, or to a civil case that was dismissed with or without\nprejudice, or to a civil case that was disposed of by judgment, if the cases: [¶] (1) Involve\nthe same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; [¶] (2) Arise from the same\nor substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of\n(Fn. continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                             12\n\fjudicial efficiency and to prevent plaintiffs from ‘judge shopping’ (dismissing a\ncase without prejudice and refiling in the hope of being assigned to a different\njudge).” (Weil & Brown, Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Procedure Before Trial (The\nRutter Group 2014) ¶ 12:38, p. 12(I)-9.)\n       The mere fact that an action involves claims and circumstances directly\nrelated to prior litigation does not establish that the action arises from protected\nactivity, for purposes of the anti-SLAPP law. In City of Cotati v. Cashman (2002)\n29 Cal.4th 69, 72 (Cotati), a city enacted a rent stabilization program applicable to\na mobilehome park. In response, the park owners initiated an action for\ndeclaratory relief in federal court, seeking a declaration that the program was an\nimpermissible regulatory taking under the United States Constitution. (Cotati,\nsupra, at p. 72.) Later, after the city commenced an action in state court for a\ndeclaration that the program was not an impermissible taking, the park owners\nfiled an anti-SLAPP motion, arguing that the state court action necessarily arose\nfrom protected activity, namely, the park owners’ federal court action. (Cotati, at\np. 77.)\n       In rejecting that contention, our Supreme Court concluded that under the\nanti-SLAPP statute, “the mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity\ntook place does not mean it arose from that activity.” (Cotati, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 76.) Thus, “a responsive but independent lawsuit” based on the same\n\nthe same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; [¶] (3) Involve claims against,\ntitle to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or [¶] (4) Are likely for other\nreasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different\njudges.”\n        Rule 3.300(h)(1) of the California Rules of Court provides that “[i]f all the related\ncases have been filed in one superior court, the court, on notice to all parties, may order\nthat the cases . . . be related and may assign them to a single judge or department.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\ftransaction or occurrence as a prior lawsuit does not necessarily arise from\nprotected activity, even when the responsive lawsuit was triggered by the prior\nlawsuit, or amounted to “an oppressive litigation tactic.” (Id. at p. 78.) Rather,\n“the statutory phrase ‘cause of action . . . arising from’ means simply that the\ndefendant’s act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action must itself have been an\nact in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.” (Ibid.) Applying that test\nto the facts before it, the court concluded that the city’s action did not arise from\nprotected activity, that is, the park owners’ federal action, but from the same\ndispute underlying the federal action. (Id. at pp. 79-81.)\n      Here, the seven disclosure-independent claims do not arise from the three\nprior actions regarding Williams and his estate, even though respondents’\ncomplaint mentions that litigation. A claim falls outside the scope of the anti-\nSLAPP law when its gravamen concerns unprotected activity, notwithstanding\nincidental references in the complaint to protected activity. (Coretronic, supra,\n192 Cal.App.4th at p. 1398.) “Where the defendant’s protected activity will only\nbe used as evidence in the plaintiff’s case, and none of the claims are based on it,\nthe protected activity is only incidental to the claims. [Citation.] Determining the\ngravamen of the claims requires examination of the specific acts of alleged\nwrongdoing and not just the form of the plaintiff's causes of action. [Citation.]”\n(Id. at pp. 1388-1389.)\n      Under this standard, the gravamen of a claim may involve only unprotected\nactivity, even though the alleged misconduct took place during litigation. In\nCoretronic, a law firm represented a television manufacturer during litigation with\na third party. (Coretronic, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1384, 1387-1388.) While\ndoing so, the law firm also undertook the representation of the third party in an\nunrelated action. (Ibid.) When the manufacturer commenced an action for fraud\nand breach of fiduciary duty against the law firm based on its failure to disclose the\n\n                                          14\n\fconcurrent representation, the law firm filed an anti-SLAPP motion, which the trial\ncourt denied. (Coretronic, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at p. 1387.) In affirming that\nruling, the appellate court concluded that the manufacturer’s claims fell beyond the\nscope of the anti-SLAPP law, even though the alleged misconduct occurred while\nthe attorneys represented the manufacturer against the third party. (Coretronic,\nsupra, at p. 1391.)\n        We conclude that the allegations regarding the three prior actions in\nrespondents’ complaint are incidental to the misconduct underlying the seven\ndisclosure-independent claims. Regarding those claims, the complaint asserts that\nafter Williams’s death, Heebner as trustee asked Prappas to return Williams’s and\nVirtuoso’s tax records, but he did not do so; that the three actions were filed,\nincluding Heebner’s probate action to recover the trust property; and that in the\ncourse of that litigation, Prappas admitted that he had not returned the tax records.\nBecause the references to the three prior actions state nothing more than evidence\nof the circumstances surrounding Prappas’s failure to return the records, they are\nincidental to the seven disclosure-independent claims. In sum, the probate court\ncorrectly determined that the disclosure-independent claims -- the first, second,\nfourth, fifth, sixth, ninth, and tenth causes of action -- do not arise from protected\nactivity.10\n\n10     Prappas suggests that Heebner lacks standing to assert some or all of the\ndisclosure-independent claims. However, “[a]rguments about the merits of the claims are\nirrelevant to the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis.” (Coretronic, supra, 192\nCal.App.4th at p. 1388.)\n        During oral argument, Prappas also argued that all of respondents’ claims arise\nfrom protected activity because the complaint refers to his deposition testimony in the\nprior three actions, which he maintained is subject to the litigation privilege (Civ. Code,\n§ 47). Prappas has forfeited this contention for want of argument in his briefs on appeal.\nNonetheless, we would reject it were we to consider it. The complaint alleges only that\nduring the deposition, Prappas admitted some of the misconduct alleged in the complaint,\n(Fn. continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                 2. Disclosure-Related Claims\n        We turn to the three remaining claims, which assert that Prappas improperly\ndisclosed tax records (third, seventh and eighth causes of action; §§ 22252.1, subd.\n(a), 22253, subds. (a)(7), (a)(8)).11 The three claims allege that Prappas breached\nhis duties as a paid tax preparer by divulging Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax\ninformation to Armstrong, who communicated it to Jung for use in the three prior\nactions. The probate court concluded that although the claims “likely” arose from\n“arguably” protected activity, respondents demonstrated their likelihood of\nprevailing on the merits. It is unnecessary for us to assess whether the three\ndisclosure-related claims arose from protected activity, as respondents established\nthat they were likely to prevail on the merits of those claims.12\n\n\n\nnamely, that he refused to return Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax records to respondents,\nand instead gave those records to Armstrong. Because the complaint identifies Prappas’s\ntestimony as evidence of Prappas’s alleged wrongful conduct, rather than as the wrongful\nconduct itself, the complaint’s reference to Prappas’s deposition does not establish that\nrespondents’ claims arise from protected activity. (Department of Fair Employment &\nHousing v. 1105 Alta Loma Road Apartments, LLC (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1287-\n1288 & fn. 23.)\n11     Subdivision (a) of section 22252.1 provides that absent enumerated circumstances,\n“[n]o confidential information obtained by a tax preparer, in his or her professional\ncapacity, concerning a client or a prospective client shall be disclosed by the tax preparer\nwithout the written permission of the client or prospective client.”\n       Subdivisions (a)(7), (a)(8) of section 22253 provides that tax preparers may not\nviolate specified state and federal statutes prohibiting the disclosure of tax information\n(Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17530.5; 26 U.S.C.A. § 7216).\n12      Relying on the statute establishing that a violation of a tax preparer’s duties\nconstitutes a misdemeanor (§ 22256), respondents argue that the wrongful activity\nalleged in the three claims is not protected because it is “illegal as a matter of law”\n(Flatley, supra, 39 Cal.4th at p. 320). In Flatley, our Supreme Court held that a\ndefendant’s anti-SLAPP motion fails when “the defendant concedes, or the evidence\nconclusively establishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was\nillegal as a matter of law.” (Id. at p. 320, italics added.) It is unnecessary for us to\n(Fn. continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                             16\n\f      In attempting to demonstrate a probability of prevailing regarding the three\ndisclosure-related claims, respondents’ burden resembled that imposed on a\nplaintiff opposing a motion for summary judgment on his or her complaint.\n(Navellier v. Sletten (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 763, 768.) Respondents were obliged\nto establish that their claims were “both legally sufficient and supported by a\nsufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the\nevidence submitted by [respondents] is credited.” (Matson v. Dvorak (1995) 40\nCal.App.4th 539, 548.) However, “the required showing . . . is ‘not high.’\n[Citation.] . . . [P]laintiff needs to show only a ‘minimum level of legal sufficiency\nand triability.’ [Citation.]” (Grewal v. Jammu (2011) 191 Cal.App.4th 977, 989.)\nIn determining whether respondents carried this burden, the trial court was\nrequired to consider the pleadings and their supporting affidavits, to the extent\nthese contained admissible evidence. (HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co.\n(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212.) The trial court was also obliged to consider\nadmissible evidence that Prappas submitted in support of the motion, but only to\ndetermine whether it defeated respondents’ showing as a matter of law. (Ibid.)\n      Respondents carried their burden. They submitted a declaration from\nHeebner, who stated that for three and a half years prior to Williams’s death, she\nacted as his personal secretary and assistant. According to Heebner, during that\nperiod, Williams employed Prappas as his business manager. Prappas’s\nresponsibilities included “accounting and tax services,” and the maintenance of “all\nof the business records generated through his services . . . .” Heebner further stated\nthat after Williams died, she became trustee of his trust. Accompanying Heebner’s\ndeclaration was a copy of the document entitled “Third Amendment to\n\n\ndetermine whether those demanding standards are satisfied here, as we conclude that the\nprobate court’s ruling is properly affirmed on other grounds.\n\n\n                                          17\n\fAmendment and Restatement of the Roger Williams Trust,” which named Heebner\nas trustee upon Williams’s death.\n      Respondents also submitted excerpts from deposition testimony taken in the\nthree prior actions. Prappas testified that he had several clients, including\nWilliams and two of his children. Prappas acted as Williams’s business manager\nfrom 1990 to 2011, when Williams died. At some point during that period, when\nWilliams’s tax preparer retired or was let go, Prappas took on “the tax preparation\nrole” for Williams. Prappas stated that he held no professional licenses or\ncertificates, and had no formal training or degrees regarding business or\naccounting. According to Prappas, in October 2011, when attorney Armstrong\nasked for Prappas’s records regarding Williams, Prappas gave them to Armstrong.\n      Jung testified that Armstrong represented both Prappas and herself in the\nthree prior actions, and that she obtained checks written by Williams from “[her]\nlawyer.” In addition, Williams’s daughter, Laura Williams Fisher, testified that\nafter Williams died, she asked Jung how she had secured canceled checks signed\nby Williams. According to Fisher, Jung replied that she “got the records from . . .\nPrappas.”\n      Respondents thus made an adequate prima facie showing of Heebner’s\nstanding to assert the disclosure-related claims on behalf of the trust and Virtuoso.\nHeebner’s declaration established that as trustee of Williams’s trust, she was\nentitled to assert that Prappas had wrongfully disclosed tax information belonging\nto the trust. (Powers v. Ashton (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 783, 787-788 [right to assert\nclaims on behalf of trust is vested in trustee].) That entitlement included claims by\nVirtuoso, as Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion acknowledged that Virtuoso was\nWilliams’s closely held corporation and an element of his “estate plan.”\n      Respondents also made an adequate prima facie showing that they were\nlikely to prevail on the three disclosure-related claims. The Business and\n\n                                          18\n\fProfessions Code imposes duties of confidentiality regarding tax records on\nspecified tax preparers, which include “[a] person who, for a fee or other\nconsideration, assists with or prepares tax returns for another person” (§ 22251,\nsubd. (a)(1)(A)). Here, respondents’ evidence showed that Prappas acted as a tax\npreparer, so defined, and that Prappas breached his duties of confidentiality by\ngiving Williams’s tax records to Armstrong, who passed them to Jung.13 As\nPrappas offered no admissible evidence conclusively demonstrating Heebner’s\nlack of standing or the absence of merit of the disclosure-related claims, the\nprobate court correctly denied Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion with respect to the\nthird, seventh, and eighth causes of action.14\n\n\n              3. Prappas’s Remaining Contentions\n       Prappas contends the probate court, in assessing his anti-SLAPP motion,\nimproperly declined to take judicial notice of the case files of the three prior\nactions and the underlying action. We disagree. The court concluded that\nPrappas’s requests contravened rules 3.110 and 3.113 of the California Rules of\n\n\n13      We recognize that the Business and Professions Code exempts from the class of\ntax preparers “an employee who, as part of the regular clerical duties of his or her\nemployment, prepares his or her employer’s income, sales, or payroll tax returns”\n(§ 22251, subd. (a)(2)). However, respondents’ showing raises the reasonable inference\nthat Prappas falls outside that exemption. Prappas testified that he managed clients other\nthan Williams, that he acted as Williams’s business manager for many years, and that he\nundertook the role of Williams’s tax preparer only when Williams’s prior tax preparer\nretired or was discharged. That testimony is sufficient to show that tax return preparation\nwas not “part of the regular clerical duties of [Prappas’s] employment” (§ 22251, subd.\n(a)(2)).\n14      In view of our conclusions regarding the ten claims alleging violations of a tax\npreparer’s duties, the probate court also correctly denied the anti-SLAPP motion with\nrespect to the claim for unfair business practices (the eleventh cause of action), which\nrelies exclusively on the misconduct identified in those ten claims.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fCourt, which specify the formal requirements for motions and requests for judicial\nnotice. Rule 3.1113(l) of the California Rules of Court states: “Any request for\njudicial notice must be made in a separate document listing the specific items for\nwhich notice is requested and must comply with rule 3.1306(c).” Rule 3.1306(c)\nof the California Rules of Court requires the party seeking judicial notice to\nprovide copies of the pertinent materials to the court and parties, or arrange for\nthem to be present at the relevant hearing.\n       We discern no error in the probate court’s ruling, as Prappas did not comply\nwith those rules. Prappas’s requests were made in his motion and replies, not in\nseparate documents. Moreover, although his brief on appeal asserts that he\narranged for the presence of the case files at the hearing on his anti-SLAPP\nmotions, nothing in the record establishes that he did so. The requests were thus\nproperly denied. (See Conservatorship of Bones (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1010,\n1014, fn. 2 [appellate court denied request for judicial notice of entire case file\nsupported only by reference to case number].)\n       Moreover, even had the denials been erroneous, Prappas has shown no\nprejudice from them. Prappas contends the case files for which he sought judicial\nnotice showed that respondents’ claims arose from protected activity, arguing that\nthe case files demonstrated that the three prior actions involved similar or identical\nclaims, or relied on similar or identical facts. That argument fails for the reasons\ndiscussed above (see pt. B.1., ante).15\n       Prappas also contends the probate court erroneously (1) overruled his\nobjection to respondents’ opposition and (2) sustained respondents’ objections to\n\n15    Prappas also suggests that the materials for which he sought judicial notice\nconclusively showed that respondents’ claims were meritless. However, as he offers no\nargument (with pertinent record citations) to support that contention, he has forfeited it.\n(Paulus, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 687; Schoendorf, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at p. 237.)\n\n\n                                            20\n\fhis evidentiary showing. He asserts that the opposition and objections were\nuntimely, and the objections themselves were “nothing more than ‘averments.’”\nThose contentions are forfeited for want of supporting argument. (Paulus, supra,\n139 Cal.App.4th at p. 687; Schoendorf, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at p. 237.)\n      Furthermore, we would reject the contentions were we to consider them, as\nPrappas has shown no reversible error regarding the rulings. Assuming -- without\ndeciding -- that respondents’ opposition was untimely, the probate court had the\ndiscretion to consider the opposition in the absence of prejudice to Prappas. (See\nKapitanski v. Von’s Grocery Co. (1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 29, 32-33.) The record\ndiscloses no such prejudice, as the probate court continued the hearing on the anti-\nSLAPP motion, and permitted Prappas to file a supplemental reply.\n      Prappas has also failed to show that the rulings regarding respondents’\nevidentiary objections constitute reversible error. Some of those rulings excluded\nportions of declarations from Armstrong containing broad and unspecific\nobjections to respondents’ evidentiary showing. Because Evidence Code section\n353 requires specificity in objections to evidence, the probate court properly\nsustained respondents’ objections. The remaining rulings excluded portions of\nArmstrong’s declarations contesting respondents’ legal contentions, and asserting\nthat respondents had failed to file and serve their opposition to the anti-SLAPP\nmotion in a timely manner. Because Prappas’s replies also set forth his challenges\nto respondents’ legal contentions, those rulings were not prejudicial, as they\nexcluded only matters irrelevant to the two-prong test governing anti-SLAPP\nmotions. In sum, the probate court properly denied Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      D. Respondents’ Request for Award of Attorney Fees Incurred on\n         Appeal\n      Respondents request an award of attorney fees on appeal, arguing that\nPrappas’s appeal is frivolous and was intended only to cause further delay of the\nlitigation. Under the anti-SLAPP statute, “[t]he right to attorney fees extends to\nattorney fees on appeal as well.” (Morrow v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.\n(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1424, 1446; accord, City of Alhambra v. D’Ausilio (2011)\n193 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1309.) Here, Prappas does not directly contest the\ndeterminations underlying the probate court’s fee award; to the extent he seeks\nreversal of that award, his sole contention is that the probate court improperly\ndenied his anti-SLAPP motion. Because Prappas’s arguments in support of the\nmotion are materially identical to those presented to the probate court, respondents\nare entitled to an additional award of the attorney fees they have incurred on\nappeal. (City of Alhambra, supra, 193 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1309-1310 [after\nsuccessfully opposing anti-SLAPP motion and obtaining attorney fee award,\nplaintiff was entitled to fees incurred on appeal because defendant’s sole challenge\nto fee award was that the motion had been incorrectly denied, and defendant raised\nno new arguments in support of motion].) The amount of the award is to be\ndetermined by the probate court upon motion by respondents.

Heebner, trustee of the\nRoger Williams Trust, and Virtuoso, Inc. (Virtuoso) assert claims against appellant\nWilliam Prappas for violations of a tax preparer’s statutory duties. On appeal,\nPrappas challenges the trial court’s denial of his motion under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 425.16 -- the law designed to curtail the filing of strategic\nlawsuits against public participation, often called the “anti-SLAPP law.” We\naffirm.\n\n\n       RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      Virtuoso is a closely held corporation established by Roger Williams, the\nwell known pianist and performer. In 1996, Williams also created a personal trust,\nwhich was later amended and restated. For several years, Prappas acted as\nbusiness manager for Williams and Virtuoso. In October 2011, Williams died.\n      In February 2012, Williams’ daughter, Alice Williams Jung, initiated a\nprobate action to invalidate certain testamentary instruments attributed to\nWilliams, and remove Heebner as trustee of Williams’s trust (L.A.S.C. Case No.\nBP 133277). Jung’s petition alleged that several instruments executed by\nWilliams, including amendments to the trust naming Heebner as trustee, were the\nproduct of “fraud, menace, forgery, duress [and] undue influence” by Heebner.\nJung’s petition sought the appointment of Prappas as trustee of the trust.\n      On March 9, 2012, Heebner filed a probate action in her alleged capacity as\nthe trustee of Williams’s trust (L.A.S.C.

Underlying Proceedings\n      Respondents’ complaint, filed September 14, 2012, contains ten claims for\nbreach of a tax preparer’s duties (§§ 22250, 22252, 22252.1, 22253, 22255), and a\nclaim for unfair business practices (§ 17200). In support of those claims, the\ncomplaint alleges that prior to Williams’s death, he and Virtuoso paid Prappas to\nprepare and file tax returns for them, but Prappas failed to comply with certain\nstatutory duties imposed on tax preparers. The complaint further alleges that after\n\n                                          6\n\fWilliams’s death, Prappas violated other statutory duties when he refused to return\ntax records to Heebner, and instead gave them to his attorney, James Armstrong,\nwho also represents Jung in the three prior actions regarding Williams and his\nestate. According to the complaint, attorney Armstrong disclosed the tax records\nto Jung, and used them in those actions. The complaint sought restitution,\ndisgorgement of profits, statutory fines, and an award of attorney fees; in addition,\nit maintained that Prappas’s misconduct constituted misdemeanors (§ 22256).\n      As we elaborate below (see pt. C.1., post), five of the complaint’s claims are\npredicated primarily on allegations that Prappas violated a tax preparer’s duties\nwhen he prepared and filed Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax returns. Of the\nremaining claims, five rely -- at least in part -- on allegations that Prappas\ncontravened a tax preparer’s duties after Williams’s death: two claims assert that\nPrappas failed to return respondents’ tax records when Heebner requested them,\nand three claims assert that Prappas improperly disclosed the records to third\nparties. The remaining claim under the Unfair Competition Law (UCL) (Bus. &\nProf. Code, § 17200 et seq.) is predicated on the unlawful conduct alleged in the\nother claims, and seeks disgorgement of Prappas’s profits.\n      Upon filing the complaint, respondents submitted a notice identifying their\naction as related to the three prior actions regarding Williams and his estate. In\nresponse to that notice, the trial judge assigned to the action referred it to another\ncourt for a determination whether the action should be reassigned to the probate\ncourt judge responsible for the three prior actions.\n      On November 21, 2012, while that determination was pending, Prappas filed\nhis anti-SLAPP motion. Prappas contended that respondents’ claims arose from\nhis protected activities, arguing that the claims had “a direct and obvious\n‘connection’ with a judicial proceeding”-- namely, the three prior actions regarding\nWilliams and his estate -- and that respondents’ complaint was “nothing more than\n\n                                           7\n\fa ruse and guise to somehow circumvent, divert, and thwart” those actions.\nPrappas requested judicial notice of the entire case files and pleadings in the prior\nactions. Additionally, Prappas asserted that respondents’ claims were “factually\nand materially deficient.”\n      On January 16, 2013, respondents filed their opposition to the anti-SLAPP\nmotion.5 On the same date, Prappas submitted what he characterized as a reply to\nrespondents’ “non-opposition” to the anti-SLAPP motion, arguing that respondents\nhad failed to file and serve a timely opposition. In support of that contention, the\nreply relied on a declaration from attorney Armstrong. The reply also requested\nthat the court take judicial notice of the case files in the three prior actions.\n      The following day, January 17, 2013, respondents’ action was determined to\nbe related to the three prior actions, and was assigned to the probate court\nresponsible for them. Later, the probate court set a hearing regarding the anti-\nSLAPP motion, and permitted Prappas to file a reply to respondents’ opposition.\n      Prappas’s supplemental reply, filed February 7, 2013, again maintained that\nrespondents had failed to file and serve their opposition in a timely manner, relying\non a declaration from Armstrong. In addition, Prappas requested judicial notice of\nthe case files in the prior three actions, as well as all the filings in the underlying\naction. Prior to the hearing on the anti-SLAPP motion, respondents objected to\nPrappas’s requests for judicial notice and portions of Armstrong’s declarations.\n\n\n\n5       Respondents opposed the motion on three grounds. First, they maintained that\ntheir claims did not implicate Prappas’s free speech or petition rights. Second, they\nargued that the misconduct alleged in the complaint was not protected activity under the\nexception stated in Flatley v. Mauro (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600567\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600567/flatley-v-mauro/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320 (Flatley) for conduct that\nis “illegal as a matter of law.” Third, they contended that even if the claims arose from\nprotected activity, there was a reasonable probability that they would prevail on the\nmerits.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       On March 20, 2013, following a hearing, the probate court denied the anti-\nSLAPP motion. In ruling, the court rejected Prappas’s requests for judicial notice,\nand sustained all but one of respondents’ objections to Armstrong’s declarations.\nThe court determined that only three claims in respondents’ complaint “likely”\narose from “arguably” protected activity, and that respondents had established their\nlikelihood of prevailing with respect to those claims, which relied on allegations\nthat Prappas improperly disclosed Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax records. The\ncourt further concluded that respondents were entitled to an award of attorney fees,\nstating that Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion “was poorly drafted, poorly organized[,]\nand overwhelmingly without merit . . . .”\n\n\n       C. Analysis\n       In assessing the trial court’s rulings, our focus is on the ten claims alleging\nviolations of a tax preparer’s duties, as the unfair business practices claim relies\nentirely on the purported unlawful activity identified in those claims.6 In denying\nthe anti-SLAPP motion, the probate court effectively segregated the ten claims into\ntwo groups on the basis of whether they alleged an unlawful disclosure of\nconfidential information. The court concluded that the seven claims lacking such\nallegations (the disclosure-independent claims) implicated no protective activity,\nand that as to the three remaining disclosure-related claims, respondents had made\nan adequate showing of prevailing on the merits. As explained below, we discern\nno error in those determinations.\n\n\n6      Generally, the UCL defines “unfair competition” broadly to include “any\nunlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice . . . .” (Bus. & Prof. Code,\n§ 17200.) Under the UCL, damages cannot be recovered, and plaintiffs are generally\nlimited to injunctive relief and restitution. (Clark v.

Five of those claims rely principally on allegations of Prappas’s\nmisconduct as a tax preparer before Williams’s death, when he prepared and filed\nWilliams’s and Virtuoso’s tax returns. Those claims assert that Prappas failed to\nsecure a bond (first cause of action; § 22250, subd. (e)(1)), failed to provide proof\nof a bond (second cause of action; § 22252), failed to register as a tax preparer\n(fourth cause of action; § 22253, subd.

The same is true here\nregarding the two claims in question.\n        Prappas contends that respondents’ claims necessarily arise from protected\nactivity because the underlying action was determined to be related to the three\nprior actions regarding Williams and his estate. He maintains that the\ncircumstances in the underlying action present “a classical example of why and\nwhen [an anti-SLAPP] motion should be granted,” arguing that all four actions\n“arise out of,” and involve, the same parties, facts, witnesses, and evidence. We\nreject his contention, as it relies on a false premise, namely, that the determination\nthat an action is related to prior litigation establishes that the claims in the action\narise from activity protected under the anti-SLAPP law.\n        Under the rules of court, as applicable here, actions may be declared related\nand assigned to a single judge when they involve claims or issues based on the\nsame transactions, incidents, or events.9 The goals of those rules are “to promote\n\n\n9      Rule 3.300(a) of the California Rules of Court states: “A pending civil case is\nrelated to another pending civil case, or to a civil case that was dismissed with or without\nprejudice, or to a civil case that was disposed of by judgment, if the cases: [¶] (1) Involve\nthe same parties and are based on the same or similar claims; [¶] (2) Arise from the same\nor substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of\n(Fn. continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                             12\n\fjudicial efficiency and to prevent plaintiffs from ‘judge shopping’ (dismissing a\ncase without prejudice and refiling in the hope of being assigned to a different\njudge).” (Weil & Brown, Cal.

(Cotati, at\np. 77.)\n       In rejecting that contention, our Supreme Court concluded that under the\nanti-SLAPP statute, “the mere fact that an action was filed after protected activity\ntook place does not mean it arose from that activity.” (Cotati, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 76.) Thus, “a responsive but independent lawsuit” based on the same\n\nthe same or substantially identical questions of law or fact; [¶] (3) Involve claims against,\ntitle to, possession of, or damages to the same property; or [¶] (4) Are likely for other\nreasons to require substantial duplication of judicial resources if heard by different\njudges.”\n        Rule 3.300(h)(1) of the California Rules of Court provides that “[i]f all the related\ncases have been filed in one superior court, the court, on notice to all parties, may order\nthat the cases . . . be related and may assign them to a single judge or department.”\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\ftransaction or occurrence as a prior lawsuit does not necessarily arise from\nprotected activity, even when the responsive lawsuit was triggered by the prior\nlawsuit, or amounted to “an oppressive litigation tactic.” (Id. at p. 78.) Rather,\n“the statutory phrase ‘cause of action . . . arising from’ means simply that the\ndefendant’s act underlying the plaintiff’s cause of action must itself have been an\nact in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.” (Ibid.) Applying that test\nto the facts before it, the court concluded that the city’s action did not arise from\nprotected activity, that is, the park owners’ federal action, but from the same\ndispute underlying the federal action. (Id. at pp. 79-81.)\n      Here, the seven disclosure-independent claims do not arise from the three\nprior actions regarding Williams and his estate, even though respondents’\ncomplaint mentions that litigation. A claim falls outside the scope of the anti-\nSLAPP law when its gravamen concerns unprotected activity, notwithstanding\nincidental references in the complaint to protected activity. (Coretronic, supra,\n192 Cal.App.4th at p. 1398.) “Where the defendant’s protected activity will only\nbe used as evidence in the plaintiff’s case, and none of the claims are based on it,\nthe protected activity is only incidental to the claims. [Citation.] Determining the\ngravamen of the claims requires examination of the specific acts of alleged\nwrongdoing and not just the form of the plaintiff's causes of action. [Citation.]”\n(Id. at pp. 1388-1389.)\n      Under this standard, the gravamen of a claim may involve only unprotected\nactivity, even though the alleged misconduct took place during litigation. In\nCoretronic, a law firm represented a television manufacturer during litigation with\na third party. (Coretronic, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1384, 1387-1388.) While\ndoing so, the law firm also undertook the representation of the third party in an\nunrelated action. (Ibid.) When the manufacturer commenced an action for fraud\nand breach of fiduciary duty against the law firm based on its failure to disclose the\n\n                                          14\n\fconcurrent representation, the law firm filed an anti-SLAPP motion, which the trial\ncourt denied. (Coretronic, supra, 192 Cal.App.4th at p. 1387.) In affirming that\nruling, the appellate court concluded that the manufacturer’s claims fell beyond the\nscope of the anti-SLAPP law, even though the alleged misconduct occurred while\nthe attorneys represented the manufacturer against the third party. (Coretronic,\nsupra, at p. 1391.)\n        We conclude that the allegations regarding the three prior actions in\nrespondents’ complaint are incidental to the misconduct underlying the seven\ndisclosure-independent claims. Regarding those claims, the complaint asserts that\nafter Williams’s death, Heebner as trustee asked Prappas to return Williams’s and\nVirtuoso’s tax records, but he did not do so; that the three actions were filed,\nincluding Heebner’s probate action to recover the trust property; and that in the\ncourse of that litigation, Prappas admitted that he had not returned the tax records.\nBecause the references to the three prior actions state nothing more than evidence\nof the circumstances surrounding Prappas’s failure to return the records, they are\nincidental to the seven disclosure-independent claims. In sum, the probate court\ncorrectly determined that the disclosure-independent claims -- the first, second,\nfourth, fifth, sixth, ninth, and tenth causes of action -- do not arise from protected\nactivity.10\n\n10     Prappas suggests that Heebner lacks standing to assert some or all of the\ndisclosure-independent claims. However, “[a]rguments about the merits of the claims are\nirrelevant to the first step of the anti-SLAPP analysis.” (Coretronic, supra, 192\nCal.App.4th at p. 1388.)\n        During oral argument, Prappas also argued that all of respondents’ claims arise\nfrom protected activity because the complaint refers to his deposition testimony in the\nprior three actions, which he maintained is subject to the litigation privilege (Civ. Code,\n§ 47). Prappas has forfeited this contention for want of argument in his briefs on appeal.\nNonetheless, we would reject it were we to consider it. The complaint alleges only that\nduring the deposition, Prappas admitted some of the misconduct alleged in the complaint,\n(Fn. continued on next page.)\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                 2. Disclosure-Related Claims\n        We turn to the three remaining claims, which assert that Prappas improperly\ndisclosed tax records (third, seventh and eighth causes of action; §§ 22252.1, subd.\n(a), 22253, subds. (a)(7), (a)(8)).11 The three claims allege that Prappas breached\nhis duties as a paid tax preparer by divulging Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax\ninformation to Armstrong, who communicated it to Jung for use in the three prior\nactions. The probate court concluded that although the claims “likely” arose from\n“arguably” protected activity, respondents demonstrated their likelihood of\nprevailing on the merits. It is unnecessary for us to assess whether the three\ndisclosure-related claims arose from protected activity, as respondents established\nthat they were likely to prevail on the merits of those claims.12\n\n\n\nnamely, that he refused to return Williams’s and Virtuoso’s tax records to respondents,\nand instead gave those records to Armstrong. Because the complaint identifies Prappas’s\ntestimony as evidence of Prappas’s alleged wrongful conduct, rather than as the wrongful\nconduct itself, the complaint’s reference to Prappas’s deposition does not establish that\nrespondents’ claims arise from protected activity.

In Flatley, our Supreme Court held that a\ndefendant’s anti-SLAPP motion fails when “the defendant concedes, or the evidence\nconclusively establishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was\nillegal as a matter of law.” (Id. at p. 320, italics added.)

Dvorak (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2302846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2302846/matson-v-dvorak/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co.\n(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299453\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299453/hms-capital-inc-v-lawyers-title-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The trial court was also obliged to consider\nadmissible evidence that Prappas submitted in support of the motion, but only to\ndetermine whether it defeated respondents’ showing as a matter of law. (Ibid.)\n      Respondents carried their burden. They submitted a declaration from\nHeebner, who stated that for three and a half years prior to Williams’s death, she\nacted as his personal secretary and assistant. According to Heebner, during that\nperiod, Williams employed Prappas as his business manager. Prappas’s\nresponsibilities included “accounting and tax services,” and the maintenance of “all\nof the business records generated through his services . . . .” Heebner further stated\nthat after Williams died, she became trustee of his trust. Accompanying Heebner’s\ndeclaration was a copy of the document entitled “Third Amendment to\n\n\ndetermine whether those demanding standards are satisfied here, as we conclude that the\nprobate court’s ruling is properly affirmed on other grounds.\n\n\n                                          17\n\fAmendment and Restatement of the Roger Williams Trust,” which named Heebner\nas trustee upon Williams’s death.\n      Respondents also submitted excerpts from deposition testimony taken in the\nthree prior actions. Prappas testified that he had several clients, including\nWilliams and two of his children. Prappas acted as Williams’s business manager\nfrom 1990 to 2011, when Williams died. At some point during that period, when\nWilliams’s tax preparer retired or was let go, Prappas took on “the tax preparation\nrole” for Williams. Prappas stated that he held no professional licenses or\ncertificates, and had no formal training or degrees regarding business or\naccounting. According to Prappas, in October 2011, when attorney Armstrong\nasked for Prappas’s records regarding Williams, Prappas gave them to Armstrong.\n      Jung testified that Armstrong represented both Prappas and herself in the\nthree prior actions, and that she obtained checks written by Williams from “[her]\nlawyer.” In addition, Williams’s daughter, Laura Williams Fisher, testified that\nafter Williams died, she asked Jung how she had secured canceled checks signed\nby Williams. According to Fisher, Jung replied that she “got the records from . . .\nPrappas.”\n      Respondents thus made an adequate prima facie showing of Heebner’s\nstanding to assert the disclosure-related claims on behalf of the trust and Virtuoso.\nHeebner’s declaration established that as trustee of Williams’s trust, she was\nentitled to assert that Prappas had wrongfully disclosed tax information belonging\nto the trust. (Powers v. Ashton (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2129329\"><a href=\"/opinion/2129329/powers-v-ashton/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 787-788 [right to assert\nclaims on behalf of trust is vested in trustee].) That entitlement included claims by\nVirtuoso, as Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion acknowledged that Virtuoso was\nWilliams’s closely held corporation and an element of his “estate plan.”\n      Respondents also made an adequate prima facie showing that they were\nlikely to prevail on the three disclosure-related claims. The Business and\n\n                                          18\n\fProfessions Code imposes duties of confidentiality regarding tax records on\nspecified tax preparers, which include “[a] person who, for a fee or other\nconsideration, assists with or prepares tax returns for another person” (§ 22251,\nsubd. (a)(1)(A)). Here, respondents’ evidence showed that Prappas acted as a tax\npreparer, so defined, and that Prappas breached his duties of confidentiality by\ngiving Williams’s tax records to Armstrong, who passed them to Jung.13 As\nPrappas offered no admissible evidence conclusively demonstrating Heebner’s\nlack of standing or the absence of merit of the disclosure-related claims, the\nprobate court correctly denied Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion with respect to the\nthird, seventh, and eighth causes of action.14\n\n\n              3. Prappas’s Remaining Contentions\n       Prappas contends the probate court, in assessing his anti-SLAPP motion,\nimproperly declined to take judicial notice of the case files of the three prior\nactions and the underlying action. We disagree. The court concluded that\nPrappas’s requests contravened rules 3.110 and 3.113 of the California Rules of\n\n\n13      We recognize that the Business and Professions Code exempts from the class of\ntax preparers “an employee who, as part of the regular clerical duties of his or her\nemployment, prepares his or her employer’s income, sales, or payroll tax returns”\n(§ 22251, subd. (a)(2)). However, respondents’ showing raises the reasonable inference\nthat Prappas falls outside that exemption. Prappas testified that he managed clients other\nthan Williams, that he acted as Williams’s business manager for many years, and that he\nundertook the role of Williams’s tax preparer only when Williams’s prior tax preparer\nretired or was discharged. That testimony is sufficient to show that tax return preparation\nwas not “part of the regular clerical duties of [Prappas’s] employment” (§ 22251, subd.\n(a)(2)).\n14      In view of our conclusions regarding the ten claims alleging violations of a tax\npreparer’s duties, the probate court also correctly denied the anti-SLAPP motion with\nrespect to the claim for unfair business practices (the eleventh cause of action), which\nrelies exclusively on the misconduct identified in those ten claims.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\fCourt, which specify the formal requirements for motions and requests for judicial\nnotice. Rule 3.1113(l) of the California Rules of Court states: “Any request for\njudicial notice must be made in a separate document listing the specific items for\nwhich notice is requested and must comply with rule 3.1306(c).” Rule 3.1306(c)\nof the California Rules of Court requires the party seeking judicial notice to\nprovide copies of the pertinent materials to the court and parties, or arrange for\nthem to be present at the relevant hearing.\n       We discern no error in the probate court’s ruling, as Prappas did not comply\nwith those rules. Prappas’s requests were made in his motion and replies, not in\nseparate documents. Moreover, although his brief on appeal asserts that he\narranged for the presence of the case files at the hearing on his anti-SLAPP\nmotions, nothing in the record establishes that he did so. The requests were thus\nproperly denied. (See Conservatorship of Bones (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2117165\"><a href=\"/opinion/2117165/conservatorship-of-bones/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1014, fn. 2 [appellate court denied request for judicial notice of entire case file\nsupported only by reference to case number].)\n       Moreover, even had the denials been erroneous, Prappas has shown no\nprejudice from them. Prappas contends the case files for which he sought judicial\nnotice showed that respondents’ claims arose from protected activity, arguing that\nthe case files demonstrated that the three prior actions involved similar or identical\nclaims, or relied on similar or identical facts. That argument fails for the reasons\ndiscussed above (see pt. B.1., ante).15\n       Prappas also contends the probate court erroneously (1) overruled his\nobjection to respondents’ opposition and (2) sustained respondents’ objections to\n\n15    Prappas also suggests that the materials for which he sought judicial notice\nconclusively showed that respondents’ claims were meritless. However, as he offers no\nargument (with pertinent record citations) to support that contention, he has forfeited it.\n(Paulus, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 687; Schoendorf, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at p. 237.)\n\n\n                                            20\n\fhis evidentiary showing. He asserts that the opposition and objections were\nuntimely, and the objections themselves were “nothing more than ‘averments.’”\nThose contentions are forfeited for want of supporting argument. (Paulus, supra,\n139 Cal.App.4th at p. 687; Schoendorf, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at p. 237.)\n      Furthermore, we would reject the contentions were we to consider them, as\nPrappas has shown no reversible error regarding the rulings. Assuming -- without\ndeciding -- that respondents’ opposition was untimely, the probate court had the\ndiscretion to consider the opposition in the absence of prejudice to Prappas. (See\nKapitanski v. Von’s Grocery Co. (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32-33.) The record\ndiscloses no such prejudice, as the probate court continued the hearing on the anti-\nSLAPP motion, and permitted Prappas to file a supplemental reply.\n      Prappas has also failed to show that the rulings regarding respondents’\nevidentiary objections constitute reversible error. Some of those rulings excluded\nportions of declarations from Armstrong containing broad and unspecific\nobjections to respondents’ evidentiary showing. Because Evidence Code section\n353 requires specificity in objections to evidence, the probate court properly\nsustained respondents’ objections. The remaining rulings excluded portions of\nArmstrong’s declarations contesting respondents’ legal contentions, and asserting\nthat respondents had failed to file and serve their opposition to the anti-SLAPP\nmotion in a timely manner. Because Prappas’s replies also set forth his challenges\nto respondents’ legal contentions, those rulings were not prejudicial, as they\nexcluded only matters irrelevant to the two-prong test governing anti-SLAPP\nmotions. In sum, the probate court properly denied Prappas’s anti-SLAPP motion.\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      D. Respondents’ Request for Award of Attorney Fees Incurred on\n         Appeal\n      Respondents request an award of attorney fees on appeal, arguing that\nPrappas’s appeal is frivolous and was intended only to cause further delay of the\nlitigation. Under the anti-SLAPP statute, “[t]he right to attorney fees extends to\nattorney fees on appeal as well.” (Morrow v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist.\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Here, Prappas does not directly contest the\ndeterminations underlying the probate court’s fee award; to the extent he seeks\nreversal of that award, his sole contention is that the probate court improperly\ndenied his anti-SLAPP motion. Because Prappas’s arguments in support of the\nmotion are materially identical to those presented to the probate court, respondents\nare entitled to an additional award of the attorney fees they have incurred on\nappeal.
