They now appeal a decision\nof the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey\ngranting summary judgment to appellees and denying it to them.\nWe will affirm.\n\n                                2\n\f                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n        M.S. is the focus of this case. He is a young boy, born\nDecember 29, 1998, who before the age of three presented “a\nstatic encephalopathy of prenatal but uncertain etiology . . .\ncoupled with autistic-like behaviors,” which was “suggestive but\nnot diagnostic of an autistic spectrum disorder.” (A1422.) His\nphysician alternatively posited a diagnosis “of speech and\nlanguage dysfunction involving both receptive and expressive\nlanguage.” (Id.) Appellants, in the words of the Administrative\nLaw Judge (“ALJ”), “have been commendably dedicated to\nlearning about their son’s disabilities and pursuing the best\neducational and related services available.” (A61.) They\nprovided their son with early therapeutic services, such as\nspeech, occupational, and physical therapy. In addition, in the\nfall of 2001, before M.S. turned three, appellants enrolled him in\npreschool programs at the Pinnacle Learning Center, the CT\nCenter, and JCC on the Palisades.\n\n        When M.S. became eligible for special education and\nrelated services under the IDEA upon turning three, appellants\ncontinued to be actively involved in the process of determining\nhow best to proceed with his education. Indeed, both before and\nafter his third birthday, a Child Study Team (“CST”) held a\nseries of meetings with and without his parents “for the purposes\nof determining [his] eligibility for special education and related\nservices and developing an [individualized education program\n(“IEP”)] for [him].” (Appellants’ Br. at 7.) The dispute in this\ncase arises out of appellants’ disagreement with the CST’s\nassessment of what educational setting and related services\nwould be appropriate for their son. As is, sadly, seen so often in\ncases brought under the IDEA, this case, from the outset, has\nbeen both difficult and emotionally charged.\n\n        The Ramsey CST received opinions from a number of\nprofessionals regarding the proper placement for M.S. Laurie\nPodd, a classroom teacher at a mainstream preschool where M.S.\nspent time prior to his third birthday, believed he was\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fprogressing on pace.1 An early enrichment teacher of M.S.,\nBrenda Brawer, believed in November of 2001 that M.S. “would\nbenefit from the educational and social experiences which could\nbe provided in a typical preschool if he was accompanied by a\n‘shadow’ trained in behavioral intervention.” (A1442.) M.S.’s\ndevelopmental pediatrician, Dr. Debra E. Seltzer, also opined\nthat he “would benefit most from daily contact with typically\ndeveloping peer role models in a supportive, nurturing\nenvironment.” (A1425.) “A preschool handicapped class would\ntherefore not provide the most appropriate educational setting\nfor” M.S. (Id.) His speech therapist joined those advocating for\nan “integrated preschool program.” (A1440.) In light of these\nopinions, appellants sought to have M.S. continue in the\nPinnacle program with a shadow.\n\n       The CST, however, advocated for a segregated\nplacement. In support of that position, appellees point to the\nassessments conducted by social worker Stacy McDonough,\npsychologist Stacie Greenberg, and learning disabilities teacher-\nconsultant and case manager Joan Moore. The consensus of\nthat group, in the opinion of Ms. McDonough, was that M.S.\nwould benefit most from a preschool setting “that utilizes a more\none-to-one approach and incorporates both language and\nfrequent refocusing in order to continue to develop age\nappropriate skills for attention and communication.” (A1512.)\nThe group was also concerned that his then-full schedule of\nservices and activities arranged by appellants was too\nburdensome for him. On December 11, 2001, Ms. Moore, on\nbehalf of the CST, circulated an IEP providing for a half day at\nthe Hubbard School, a self-contained class of children with\ndisabilities run by Ramsey with supplemental, related services\ninfused into the day.\n\n       Appellants rejected that proposal, believing that M.S.\n\n\n\n       1\n         Appellees point out that as of November 15, 2001, Ms.\nPodd’s evaluation of M.S. was not uniformly positive. While that\nis true, we believe appellants fairly characterize her assessment of\nM.S.\n\n                                 4\n\fcould continue to succeed and develop in a mainstream\nclassroom setting and would benefit from modeling the\nmainstream student population. They also were not satisfied\nwith the providers of the supplemental services offered by\nRamsey. In light of that rejection, the CST met without\nappellants on January 3, 2002 and subsequently sent appellants a\nrevised IEP. Although the opinions of outside experts were\nincluded in the revised IEP, the recommendations were\nmaterially the same. The IEP did, however, note appellants’\ndesired placement and the CST’s “anticipat[ion] that an\nintegrated preschool may be appropriate in September [2002].”\n(A1584.) Appellants again rejected the IEP, opting to continue\nM.S.’s education in the programs in which he was already\nenrolled and provide additional services through private\nprofessionals.\n\n        Despite their collective opinion, appellees endeavored, in\nlight of appellants’ wishes, to find a spot for M.S. in an\nintegrated classroom for that spring. They discovered that a\nprogram in Garfield, New Jersey, had an opening. Garfield,\nhowever, rejected M.S., believing he was not yet ready for its\nprogram.2 Appellees continued to attempt to resolve their\ndifferences with appellants and Ramsey’s Director of Special\nServices, Fredericka Shpetner, secured a spot for M.S. in an\nintegrated classroom in Park Ridge starting in September 2002.\nThat placement was included in an IEP presented to appellants\non July 22, 2002. Although pleased with the placement,\nappellants were not completely satisfied. They believed that the\nprovision of supplemental services was inadequate because they\ncould not be confident of the qualifications of the unnamed\nproviders. Appellants also believed that the goals included\nwithin the IEP did not adequately account for the gains M.S. had\nmade during the spring.3 Consequently, while accepting the\n\n\n       2\n       Appellants contend that Garfield’s Learning Consultant\nwas biased against M.S. due to prior dealings with the family. The\nALJ found this contention to be groundless.\n       3\n       Appellees note that they had limited ability to assess M.S.’s\ndevelopment at that point in light of appellants’ decision to have\n\n                                 5\n\fPark Ridge program, appellants made their own plans for the\nprovision of supplemental services.\n\n                 II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA.    Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n      The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n       When deciding an IDEA case, the District Court applies a\nmodified version of de novo review and is required to give due\nweight to the factual findings of the ALJ. See S.H. v. State-\nOperated Sch. Dist. of the City of Newark, 336 F.3d 260, 269-70\n(3d Cir. 2003); see also Board of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176,\n206 (1982); Shore Regional High Sch. Bd. of Educ. v. P.S., 381\nF.3d 194, 199 (3d Cir. 2004) (describing the District Court’s\nburden as “unusual” insofar as it “must make its own findings by\na preponderance of the evidence” but “must also afford ‘due\nweight’ to the ALJ's determination”).4 On review, “we of course\n\n\nM.S. receive services from non-Ramsey providers.\n      4\n             “In addition, if a state administrative\n             agency has heard live testimony and\n             has found the testimony of one\n             witness to be more worthy of belief\n             than the contradictory testimony of\n             another witness, that determination is\n             due special weight. Specifically, this\n             means that a District Court must\n             accept the state agency's credibility\n             determinations ‘unless the non-\n             testimonial, extrinsic evidence in the\n             record would justify a contrary\n             conclusion.’ (emphasis added). In this\n             context the word ‘justify’ demands\n             essentially the same standard of\n             review given to a trial court's findings\n             of fact by a federal appellate court.”\n\n                                6\n\fexercise plenary review with respect to the question whether the\nDistrict Court applied the correct legal standards under the\nIDEA, but we review the District Court's factual findings for\nclear error.” Shore Regional, 381 F.3d at 199 (citations omitted);\nsee id. (“‘A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, after\nreviewing the evidence, the court of appeals is left with a\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted.’”) (citation omitted).\n\nB.     IDEA\n\n        The IDEA implements the congressional determination\nthat “[i]mproving educational results for children with\ndisabilities is an essential element of our national policy of\nensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent\nliving, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with\ndisabilities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(1). To that end, the statute\nrequires, in relevant part, that states receiving federal funding\nunder the statute must have “in effect policies and procedures to\nensure that . . . [a] free appropriate public education is available\nto all children with disabilities . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A).\n“An individualized education program, or an individualized\nfamily service plan . . . [must be] developed, reviewed and\nrevised for each child with a disability . . . .” 20 U.S.C. §\n1412(a)(4). The education of disabled students must “[t]o the\nmaximum extent appropriate” be provided “with children who\nare not disabled.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (“[S]pecial classes,\nseparate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities\nfrom the regular educational environment occurs only when the\nnature or severity of the disability of a child is such that\neducation in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids\nand services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.”).\n\n\n       When a state fails to provide a free appropriate public\neducation (“FAPE”), it must reimburse parents for resulting\nprivate school costs. See T.R. v. Kingwood Township Bd. of\nEduc., 205 F.3d 572, 577 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Burlington v.\n\n\nShore Regional, 381 F.3d at 199 (citations omitted).\n\n                                 7\n\fDep’t of Educ. of Commonwealth of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 370\n(1985)). A FAPE is an education “specially designed to meet\nthe unique needs of the handicapped child, supported by such\nservices as are necessary to permit the child ‘to benefit’ from the\ninstruction.” Rowley, 458 U.S. at 188-89. “The education\nprovided must ‘be sufficient to confer some educational benefit\nupon the handicapped child,’ although the state is not required to\n‘maximize the potential of handicapped children.’” Kingwood\nTownship, 205 F.3d at 577 (citations omitted). At one time, we\nonly required that a child’s IEP offer “more than a trivial or de\nminimis educational benefit,” Oberti v. Bd. of Educ. of Borough\nof Clementon Sch. Dist., 995 F.2d 1204, 1213 (3d Cir. 1993);\nmore recently, however, we have “squarely held that ‘the\nprovision of merely “more than a trivial educational benefit”\ndoes not meet’ the meaningful benefit requirement of Polk [v.\nCentral Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, 853 F.2d 171 (3d\nCir. 1988)].” Kingwood Township, 205 F.3d at 577 (quoting\nRidgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E., 172 F.3d 238, 247 (3d Cir.\n1999)).\n\n\n        The mainstreaming component of the IDEA “require[s]\nthat a disabled child be placed in the least restrictive\nenvironment [(“LRE”)] that will provide him with a meaningful\neducational benefit.” 5 Kingwood Township, 205 F.3d at 578. To\nthat end, disabled children shall be, “to the greatest extent\npossible, satisfactorily educate[d] . . . together with children who\nare not disabled, in the same school the disabled child would\nattend if the child were not disabled.” Carlisle Area Sch. v. Scott\nP., 62 F.3d 520, 535 (3d Cir. 1995). To determine whether a\nstate is complying with the LRE requirement, we first ask\n“‘whether education in the regular classroom, with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services, can be achieved\nsatisfactorily.’” Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1215 (citation omitted). To\nenable us to answer that question, we consider “(1) the steps the\nschool district has taken to accommodate the child in a regular\n\n\n       5\n        “[T]his provision sets forth a ‘strong congressional\npreference’ for integrating children with disabilities in regular\nclassrooms.” Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1213-1214.\n\n                                 8\n\fclassroom; (2) the child’s ability to receive an educational\nbenefit from regular education; and (3) the effect the disabled\nchild’s presence has on the regular classroom.” Kingwood\nTownship, 205 F.3d at 579.\n\n\n        A word about the first and second factors. In considering\nthe former, a court must determine whether the school district\nprovides “a continuum of alternative placements . . . to meet the\nneeds of handicapped children. . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 300.551(a).\nThis continuum must include “the whole range of supplemental\naids and services.” Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1216 (quotations and\ncitation omitted). The second factor entails a comparison\nbetween the benefits of a mainstream placement and a special\neducation classroom. See id. (“The court will have to rely\nheavily in this regard on the testimony of educational experts.”).\nThe unique benefits that will accrue to the child in a mainstream\nclassroom also must be considered. Id. at 1216-17. “Thus, a\ndetermination that a child with disabilities might make greater\nacademic progress in a segregated, special education class may\nnot warrant excluding that child from a regular classroom\nenvironment.” Id. at 1217. If a court finds that a child cannot be\nsatisfactorily educated in a regular classroom, it must then\ndetermine “‘whether the school has mainstreamed the child to\nthe maximum extent appropriate,’ i.e., whether the school has\nmade efforts to include the child in school programs with\nnondisabled children whenever possible.” Id. at 1215 (citation\nomitted).\n\n\n       We have noted that the mainstreaming issue is a difficult\none “in light of the apparent tension within the Act between the\nstrong preference for mainstreaming and the requirement that\nschools provide individualized programs tailored to the specific\nneeds of each disabled child.” Id. at 1214 (citations omitted).\nAs we advised in Oberti:\n\n\n       The key to resolving this tension appears to lie in\n       the school’s proper use of ‘supplementary aids and\n       services,’ which may enable the school to educate\n\n                                9\n\f       a child with disabilities for a majority of the time\n       within a regular classroom, while at the same time\n       addressing that child’s unique educational needs.\n\n\nId. (citation omitted). In sum, a court determines, through a\ncomparison of educational opportunities supported by expert\ntestimony, whether the child can be satisfactorily educated in a\nregular classroom with supplemental services. If it finds that the\nchild cannot be satisfactorily educated in that manner, the court\nmust consider whether the school attempted to mainstream the\nchild to the maximum extent possible.\n\n\nC.     Burden of Proof\n\n\n       We have always placed the burden of demonstrating\ncompliance with the IDEA on the school district. See Kingwood\nTownship, 205 F.3d at 579; Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1219. While this\nappeal was pending, however, the Supreme Court held that the\n“burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP\nis properly placed upon the party seeking relief.” Schaffer v.\nWeast, 126 S.Ct. 528, 537 (2005). The Schaffer Court declined\nto address the issue of whether a state could, by statute, place the\nburden exclusively upon the school district. Id. New Jersey has\nno such statute. Nevertheless, appellants contend that the rule in\nLascari v. Bd. of Educ., 116 N.J. 30 (1989), where the Supreme\nCourt of New Jersey placed the burden on the school district\nregardless of which party sought relief, is unaffected by\nSchaffer. Appellants thus attempt to avoid the application of\nSchaffer by arguing that it “does not provide the rule of law in\nNew Jersey.” (Appellants’ Letter Br.) 6\n\n\n       That argument is unavailing. The Court in Schaffer saw\nno reason to depart from “the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs\nbear the risk of failing to prove their claims,” 126 S.Ct. at 534,\n\n\n       6\n        We provided the parties an opportunity to supplement their\nbriefing in the wake of the decision in Schaffer.\n\n                                10\n\fleaving for another day whether a state can overcome that rule\nby statute. Lascari addressed that very question: where, in the\nabsence of a federal or state statutory provision providing\notherwise, should the burden of proof rest when the\nappropriateness of an IEP is challenged? Citing state and federal\nstatutory and regulatory schemes implementing not the IDEA,\nbut its precursor, the Lascari Court determined that placing the\nburden upon the school district was most appropriate. See\nLascari, 116 N.J. at 44-46. Schaffer rejected that conclusion.\nBecause this case is brought solely under the IDEA and arises in\na state lacking a statutory or regulatory provision purporting to\ndefine the burden of proof in administrative hearings assessing\nIEPs, Schaffer controls.7\n\n\n        Appellants would also have us limit the holding in\nSchaffer to the FAPE aspect of the analysis. Although, to be\nsure, the facts in Schaffer implicated only the FAPE analysis, the\nSupreme Court made it quite clear that its holding applied to the\nappropriateness of the IEP as a whole. Appellants quote limiting\nlanguage – “We hold no more than we must to resolve the case\nat hand,” Schaffer, 126 S.Ct. at 537– in arguing that the decision\ndoes not reach the LRE analysis. The Court’s holding, which\ndirectly followed the quoted language, however, vitiates that\nattempt: “The burden of proof in an administrative hearing\nchallenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking\nrelief.” Id. (emphasis added). It would be unreasonable for us to\nlimit that holding to a single aspect of an IEP, where the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         The Lascari Court described “the education of handicapped\nchildren” as “an exercise in cooperative federalism.” Lascari, 116\nN.J. at 33. It noted, however, that the relevant state and federal\nstatutes and regulations did not “address the basic issue before” it,\nnamely, “the allocation of the burden of persuasion or proof.” Id.\nat 43. Lascari filled that gap, providing the default rule previously\napplied by us as well. Schaffer precludes our continued application\nof that rule, at least to the facts of this case.\n\n                                 11\n\fquestion framed by the Court,8 and the answer it provided, do\nnot so constrict the reach of its decision.9\n\n\n       Consequently, appellants bear the burden of proof when\nchallenging the appropriateness of the relevant IEPs. In the\nproceedings before both the ALJ and the District Court, the\nburden was placed upon appellees and, in both proceedings,\nappellees prevailed. What may have been a close case pre-\nSchaffer is, in the wake of Schaffer, no longer so. As we discuss\nbelow, appellants have not carried their burden on the question\nof the appropriateness of the relevant IEPs.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       The Court “granted certiorari to resolve the following\nquestion: At an administrative hearing assessing the\nappropriateness of an IEP, which party bears the burden of\npersuasion?” Schaffer, 126 S.Ct. at 533 (citation omitted).\n       9\n        Appellants also argue that, in the event Schaffer is deemed\napplicable and their evidence is found to be insufficient, the case\nshould be remanded “because this case was tried under controlling\nlaw which imposed the burden of proof on the school district.”\n(Appellants’ Letter Br.) Appellants do not, however, give any\nindication of what “additional evidence” they would be able to\nproduce or why, regardless of where the burden is placed, they\nwould not have submitted that evidence in pressing their claim\nduring the prior proceedings.\n\n                                12\n\f                         III. ANALYSIS 10\n\n\n       Appellants contend that their son was denied a free\nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment\ndue to an invalid assessment of his individual needs and pursuant\nto an overarching policy against the integration of disabled\nstudents. The ALJ, after holding a six-day hearing, rejected\nthese contentions in a lengthy and extraordinarily thorough\nopinion, and the District Court affirmed.\n\n\nA.     Spring 2002 IEP\n\n\n       The central questions in the proceedings before the ALJ\nand the District Court were whether the Board carried its burden\nof demonstrating that in the spring of 2002 M.S. could not be\nsatisfactorily educated “in the regular classroom, with\nsupplementary aids and support services,” Oberti, 995 F.2d at\n1207, and whether he was, to the maximum extent appropriate,\neducated with nondisabled students. Both the ALJ and District\nCourt, having placed the burden on the Board, found that it had\ndone so.\n\n\n       Appellants contend that the District Court improperly\naffirmed the ALJ’s conflation of the FAPE analysis with the\nLRE analysis. They point to the following language in the\nALJ’s decision: “the relevant inquiry is not whether the program\nestablished for M.S. by his parents was ‘better’ for M.S.; but\n\n\n       10\n         An amicus brief in support of appellants details the\nbenefits realized by disabled children when fully included in\nmainstream educational environments. We do not question the\nintent of the IDEA, as explicitly stated in the statute, to ensure that\ndisabled students are educated “to the maximum extent\nappropriate” with nondisabled students. Our role here is simply to\nreview, under the applicable standard of review, the District\nCourt’s application of that statutory scheme to the facts of this\ncase. On that issue, the amicus brief offers little guidance.\n\n                                  13\n\fwhether the placement of M.S. in the Hubbard program for the\nspring semester of 2002 was appropriate.” (A64.) Appellants\nare correct that whether an education is “appropriate” for\npurposes of the FAPE analysis and whether a student has been\nintegrated “to the maximum extent appropriate” are distinct\nquestions. Their argument, however, that the analyses were\nconflated is unavailing. The ALJ accurately outlined the\nappropriate standards and then, in applying them, demonstrated\nan understanding of what the statute required. In stating the\nframework for decision, the ALJ correctly distinguished between\nthe FAPE and LRE analyses, and properly distilled the question\nbefore her as “whether the Hubbard School placement was the\nleast restrictive environment . . . in which M.S. could receive a\nFAPE.” (A54; see A54-57 (detailing the analytical steps\nrequired by relevant Third Circuit precedent).)\n\n\n        The ALJ’s later indication that “the relevant inquiry is not\nwhether the program established for M.S. by his parents was\n‘better’ for M.S., but whether the placement of M.S. in the\nHubbard program for the spring semester of 2002 was\nappropriate,” does on its face appear to conflate the sufficiency\nof the educational benefits for purposes of FAPE analysis with\nwhether M.S. could be more fully mainstreamed while still\nreceiving a FAPE. Nevertheless, in light of the ALJ’s earlier\ndetailed and accurate recitation of the relevant standards, this\nlanguage is most fairly read to address only the question of\nwhether the Hubbard Program was appropriate. The ALJ, as\nevidenced by her careful review of the testimony and ultimate\nconclusion that “M.S. could not receive a satisfactory\neducational opportunity in a less restrictive environment,” (A65),\ndemonstrated an understanding of the distinct LRE issue in play.\n\n\n       The District Court considered and explicitly rejected the\nargument appellants raise here, namely that the ALJ did not\nseparately address the LRE question. The Court was convinced,\nas are we, that the ALJ properly understood the legal framework\nand addressed in all material respects the facts in that light. The\nALJ, the Court found, “credit[ed] the testimony of educational\nexperts who had observed M.S.” and “held that the CST\n\n                                14\n\fseriously considered and reconsidered less restrictive placements\nfor M.S. prior to offering placement at the Hubbard Program.”\n(A97.) In the end, however, the CST “determined that such a\nplacement would not provide him with satisfactory educational\nopportunities.” (Id.) We believe that both the ALJ and the\nDistrict Judge apprehended, and in all material ways applied, the\nappropriate legal standards. What remains for us to decide is\nwhether the factual findings of the ALJ, as affirmed by the\nDistrict Court (i.e., finding appellees’ witnesses more credible\nand compelling with regard to whether M.S. could receive a\nFAPE in a less restrictive environment) were clearly erroneous.\n\n\n        The ALJ and the District Court relied upon evidence\nsupporting a finding that M.S. could not receive a satisfactory\neducation in the regular classroom and that the IEP adopted by\nappellees provided for an education in the LRE. That evidence,\nas outlined by the ALJ, included the testimony of officials and\neducators who recounted their opinion that the Hubbard School\nwas the most inclusive environment in which M.S. could receive\nan appropriate education.\n\n\n       In appellants’ estimation, however, the record is “devoid\nof any evidence to support a finding that [M.S.] could not have\nbeen educated satisfactorily in a regular classroom with\nsupplementary aids and services.” (Appellees’ Br. at 23.) They\nask us to find that the Board predetermined that M.S. would be\nin a segregated environment. In support of that contention, they\nquote Ms. Moore’s deposition testimony that she did not\ninterview the Pinnacle staff to determine whether M.S. could\ncontinue there with supplemental aids and services. That\ntestimony, however, is simply not enough to call into question,\nmuch less to counter, the evidence and testimony found credible\nby the ALJ, who opined that M.S. could not receive an\nappropriate education in an environment less restrictive than the\nHubbard School program. The fact that appellants disagree does\nnot make that evidence less substantial or render it insufficient to\nsupport a grant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f        Appellants also argue that the Board was being\ndisingenuous when it agreed to find an integrated placement for\nM.S. in February 2002. We summarily reject that argument.\nThe Board offered its opinion regarding the proper placement of\nM.S. and appellants turned it down. In light of that rejection, the\nBoard made efforts to accommodate appellants’ wishes; indeed,\nthe efforts made on M.S.’s behalf in February 2002 were quite\nappropriately treated by the ALJ and the District Court as\nevidence of the Board’s good faith attempts to find a placement\nacceptable to appellants who, as parents, have an integral role in\nthe statutory scheme, while maintaining its view that that\nplacement was not appropriate for M.S. Moreover, the ALJ and\nthe District Court found that the Board considered a full range of\noptions for M.S., giving his situation the individualized\nassessment required by the IDEA.\n\n\n        In sum, the Board did not believe that M.S. could receive\nan appropriate education in an integrated classroom with\nsupplemental services. The ALJ, in the end, was persuaded by\nthe testimony on behalf of the Board and rejected that offered by\nappellants. The District Court believed that the ALJ’s findings\nwere supported by the record. We see no basis, particularly in\nthe wake of Schaffer, to upset those findings. Cf. Oberti, 995\nF.2d at 1222 (“In short, the parties’ experts disagreed on the\nrespective benefits of a segregated versus an integrated\nplacement for [the student], and the district court was in a better\nposition than we are to evaluate their testimony. We therefore\ndefer to that court’s findings, which, at all events, are not clearly\nerroneous.”).\n\n\nB.     Partial Reimbursement\n\n\n       The ALJ found in favor of appellants on the question of\nwhether the IEP offered adequate speech therapy, a finding\naffirmed by the District Court. The ALJ determined that “M.S.\nsuffered from severe articulation problems, which required that\nhe receive more individual speech therapy than . . . offered in the\nIEP.” (A66.) She therefore ordered the Board to partially\n\n                                 16\n\freimburse appellants for the difference between the amount of\ntime offered and the amount of time M.S. should have been\noffered for speech therapy.\n\n\n        Appellants have concluded from this that the ALJ\n“[a]llow[ed] the Board a credit for speech therapy from which\nthe ALJ explicitly determined M.S. would not benefit, in the\nabsence of any claim or evidence that the speech therapy\nprovided by M.S.’ parents was inappropriate . . . .” (Appellants’\nBr. at 51.) The ALJ clearly stated, however, that M.S. needed\nmore speech therapy than provided by the Board, not that the\nBoard’s therapy provided no benefit. We agree with the ALJ\nand the District Court that partial reimbursement was\nappropriate.11\n\n\nC.     2002-2003 IEP\n\n\n        Appellants also dispute the adequacy of the Board’s IEP\nfor the 2002-2003 school year.12 As noted above, M.S. began at\nan integrated placement in September 2002 and was offered\nsupplemental services by the Board. Appellants were satisfied\nwith the placement but objected to the provision of services by\nunnamed professionals, arguing that the Board failed to establish\nthrough its IEP that the providers would be able to provide him\nwith a FAPE. They contend that the ALJ incorrectly found that\n\n\n       11\n        The Board’s inability to carry what was then its burden on\nthis question before the ALJ does not necessarily lead to the\nconclusion that appellants on remand would be able to carry what\nis now their burden. In their letter brief following Schaffer,\nhowever, appellees did not request that this aspect of the case be\nremanded for proceedings under the burden of proof announced in\nSchaffer. We, therefore, will uphold the award of partial\nreimbursement.\n       12\n        Appellants take issue, as well, with the adequacy of the\nsupplemental services provided in the spring of 2002. We have\nconsidered the arguments raised and find them unpersuasive.\n\n                               17\n\fan IEP need only provide “some educational benefit.” (A64\n(“Clearly, the program was sufficient to provide some\neducational benefit upon M.S.”)) We see no error; indeed, the\nsame language – “some educational benefit” – is found in our\nKingwood Township decision. That decision clearly confirmed\nthat “some educational benefit” requires provision of a\n“meaningful educational benefit,” 205 F.3d at 577, the standard\nthe ALJ clearly and accurately outlined earlier in her opinion.\n\n\n       The District Court’s determination that the ALJ “did\nrequire the Board to adduce evidence to prove that the related\nservices would have conferred a meaningful educational benefit\nto M.S.” will, therefore, not be disturbed. We reject appellants’\nsuggestion that the ALJ and the District Court were stating an\nipso facto rule that all the Board needed to do was offer certified\nprofessionals. The District Court’s opinion, for example,\nevidences consideration of the actual services to be provided,\ntheir adequacy, and the certification and experience of the\nproviders. Moreover, that finding arose in the context of\nassessing whether the Board carried a burden it no longer bears.\nAppellants offered no evidence to the ALJ or to the District\nCourt, and on appeal suggest none that they could offer, calling\ninto question the qualifications of the Board’s providers of\nsupplemental services.13\n\n\nD.     § 1983\n\n\n       Finally, we reject appellants’ argument that a Board\npolicy of segregating disabled students was behind M.S.’s\nplacement. The District Court, finding no IDEA violation and\nnoting the ALJ’s supportable findings regarding individualized\n\n\n\n       13\n        Appellants also believe the IEP did not include adequate\nmeasurable goals individualized to M.S. The ALJ and District\nCourt, under the then-governing burden, found for the Board.\nWhile that finding may have presented us with a close question\nbefore, we see no basis for upsetting it now.\n\n                                18\n\fassessment, correctly granted summary judgment to appellees on\nappellants’ claim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n\n                             IV.\n\n\n       We will affirm the December 15, 2004 order of the\nDistrict Court.\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\f",

They now appeal a decision\nof the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey\ngranting summary judgment to appellees and denying it to them.\nWe will affirm.\n\n                                2\n\f                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n        M.S. is the focus of this case. He is a young boy, born\nDecember 29, 1998, who before the age of three presented “a\nstatic encephalopathy of prenatal but uncertain etiology . . .\ncoupled with autistic-like behaviors,” which was “suggestive but\nnot diagnostic of an autistic spectrum disorder.” (A1422.) His\nphysician alternatively posited a diagnosis “of speech and\nlanguage dysfunction involving both receptive and expressive\nlanguage.” (Id.) Appellants, in the words of the Administrative\nLaw Judge (“ALJ”), “have been commendably dedicated to\nlearning about their son’s disabilities and pursuing the best\neducational and related services available.” (A61.) They\nprovided their son with early therapeutic services, such as\nspeech, occupational, and physical therapy. In addition, in the\nfall of 2001, before M.S. turned three, appellants enrolled him in\npreschool programs at the Pinnacle Learning Center, the CT\nCenter, and JCC on the Palisades.\n\n        When M.S. became eligible for special education and\nrelated services under the IDEA upon turning three, appellants\ncontinued to be actively involved in the process of determining\nhow best to proceed with his education. Indeed, both before and\nafter his third birthday, a Child Study Team (“CST”) held a\nseries of meetings with and without his parents “for the purposes\nof determining [his] eligibility for special education and related\nservices and developing an [individualized education program\n(“IEP”)] for [him].” (Appellants’ Br. at 7.) The dispute in this\ncase arises out of appellants’ disagreement with the CST’s\nassessment of what educational setting and related services\nwould be appropriate for their son. As is, sadly, seen so often in\ncases brought under the IDEA, this case, from the outset, has\nbeen both difficult and emotionally charged.\n\n        The Ramsey CST received opinions from a number of\nprofessionals regarding the proper placement for M.S. Laurie\nPodd, a classroom teacher at a mainstream preschool where M.S.\nspent time prior to his third birthday, believed he was\n\n\n\n\n                                3\n\fprogressing on pace.1 An early enrichment teacher of M.S.,\nBrenda Brawer, believed in November of 2001 that M.S. “would\nbenefit from the educational and social experiences which could\nbe provided in a typical preschool if he was accompanied by a\n‘shadow’ trained in behavioral intervention.” (A1442.) M.S.’s\ndevelopmental pediatrician, Dr. Debra E. Seltzer, also opined\nthat he “would benefit most from daily contact with typically\ndeveloping peer role models in a supportive, nurturing\nenvironment.” (A1425.) “A preschool handicapped class would\ntherefore not provide the most appropriate educational setting\nfor” M.S. (Id.) His speech therapist joined those advocating for\nan “integrated preschool program.” (A1440.) In light of these\nopinions, appellants sought to have M.S. continue in the\nPinnacle program with a shadow.\n\n       The CST, however, advocated for a segregated\nplacement. In support of that position, appellees point to the\nassessments conducted by social worker Stacy McDonough,\npsychologist Stacie Greenberg, and learning disabilities teacher-\nconsultant and case manager Joan Moore. The consensus of\nthat group, in the opinion of Ms. McDonough, was that M.S.\nwould benefit most from a preschool setting “that utilizes a more\none-to-one approach and incorporates both language and\nfrequent refocusing in order to continue to develop age\nappropriate skills for attention and communication.” (A1512.)\nThe group was also concerned that his then-full schedule of\nservices and activities arranged by appellants was too\nburdensome for him. On December 11, 2001, Ms. Moore, on\nbehalf of the CST, circulated an IEP providing for a half day at\nthe Hubbard School, a self-contained class of children with\ndisabilities run by Ramsey with supplemental, related services\ninfused into the day.\n\n       Appellants rejected that proposal, believing that M.S.\n\n\n\n       1\n         Appellees point out that as of November 15, 2001, Ms.\nPodd’s evaluation of M.S. was not uniformly positive. While that\nis true, we believe appellants fairly characterize her assessment of\nM.S.\n\n                                 4\n\fcould continue to succeed and develop in a mainstream\nclassroom setting and would benefit from modeling the\nmainstream student population. They also were not satisfied\nwith the providers of the supplemental services offered by\nRamsey. In light of that rejection, the CST met without\nappellants on January 3, 2002 and subsequently sent appellants a\nrevised IEP. Although the opinions of outside experts were\nincluded in the revised IEP, the recommendations were\nmaterially the same. The IEP did, however, note appellants’\ndesired placement and the CST’s “anticipat[ion] that an\nintegrated preschool may be appropriate in September [2002].”\n(A1584.) Appellants again rejected the IEP, opting to continue\nM.S.’s education in the programs in which he was already\nenrolled and provide additional services through private\nprofessionals.\n\n        Despite their collective opinion, appellees endeavored, in\nlight of appellants’ wishes, to find a spot for M.S. in an\nintegrated classroom for that spring. They discovered that a\nprogram in Garfield, New Jersey, had an opening. Garfield,\nhowever, rejected M.S., believing he was not yet ready for its\nprogram.2 Appellees continued to attempt to resolve their\ndifferences with appellants and Ramsey’s Director of Special\nServices, Fredericka Shpetner, secured a spot for M.S. in an\nintegrated classroom in Park Ridge starting in September 2002.\nThat placement was included in an IEP presented to appellants\non July 22, 2002. Although pleased with the placement,\nappellants were not completely satisfied. They believed that the\nprovision of supplemental services was inadequate because they\ncould not be confident of the qualifications of the unnamed\nproviders. Appellants also believed that the goals included\nwithin the IEP did not adequately account for the gains M.S. had\nmade during the spring.3 Consequently, while accepting the\n\n\n       2\n       Appellants contend that Garfield’s Learning Consultant\nwas biased against M.S. due to prior dealings with the family. The\nALJ found this contention to be groundless.\n       3\n       Appellees note that they had limited ability to assess M.S.’s\ndevelopment at that point in light of appellants’ decision to have\n\n                                 5\n\fPark Ridge program, appellants made their own plans for the\nprovision of supplemental services.\n\n                 II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nA.

IDEA\n\n        The IDEA implements the congressional determination\nthat “[i]mproving educational results for children with\ndisabilities is an essential element of our national policy of\nensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent\nliving, and economic self-sufficiency for individuals with\ndisabilities.” 20 U.S.C. § 1400(c)(1). To that end, the statute\nrequires, in relevant part, that states receiving federal funding\nunder the statute must have “in effect policies and procedures to\nensure that . . . [a] free appropriate public education is available\nto all children with disabilities . . . .” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A).\n“An individualized education program, or an individualized\nfamily service plan . . . [must be] developed, reviewed and\nrevised for each child with a disability . . . .” 20 U.S.C. §\n1412(a)(4). The education of disabled students must “[t]o the\nmaximum extent appropriate” be provided “with children who\nare not disabled.” 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (“[S]pecial classes,\nseparate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities\nfrom the regular educational environment occurs only when the\nnature or severity of the disability of a child is such that\neducation in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids\nand services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.”).\n\n\n       When a state fails to provide a free appropriate public\neducation (“FAPE”), it must reimburse parents for resulting\nprivate school costs.

To\nthat end, disabled children shall be, “to the greatest extent\npossible, satisfactorily educate[d] . . . together with children who\nare not disabled, in the same school the disabled child would\nattend if the child were not disabled.” Carlisle Area Sch. v.

To determine whether a\nstate is complying with the LRE requirement, we first ask\n“‘whether education in the regular classroom, with the use of\nsupplementary aids and services, can be achieved\nsatisfactorily.’” Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1215 (citation omitted). To\nenable us to answer that question, we consider “(1) the steps the\nschool district has taken to accommodate the child in a regular\n\n\n       5\n        “[T]his provision sets forth a ‘strong congressional\npreference’ for integrating children with disabilities in regular\nclassrooms.” Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1213-1214.\n\n                                 8\n\fclassroom; (2) the child’s ability to receive an educational\nbenefit from regular education; and (3) the effect the disabled\nchild’s presence has on the regular classroom.” Kingwood\nTownship, 205 F.3d at 579.\n\n\n        A word about the first and second factors. In considering\nthe former, a court must determine whether the school district\nprovides “a continuum of alternative placements . . . to meet the\nneeds of handicapped children. . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 300.551(a).\nThis continuum must include “the whole range of supplemental\naids and services.” Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1216 (quotations and\ncitation omitted). The second factor entails a comparison\nbetween the benefits of a mainstream placement and a special\neducation classroom. See id. (“The court will have to rely\nheavily in this regard on the testimony of educational experts.”).\nThe unique benefits that will accrue to the child in a mainstream\nclassroom also must be considered. Id. at 1216-17. “Thus, a\ndetermination that a child with disabilities might make greater\nacademic progress in a segregated, special education class may\nnot warrant excluding that child from a regular classroom\nenvironment.” Id. at 1217. If a court finds that a child cannot be\nsatisfactorily educated in a regular classroom, it must then\ndetermine “‘whether the school has mainstreamed the child to\nthe maximum extent appropriate,’ i.e., whether the school has\nmade efforts to include the child in school programs with\nnondisabled children whenever possible.” Id. at 1215 (citation\nomitted).\n\n\n       We have noted that the mainstreaming issue is a difficult\none “in light of the apparent tension within the Act between the\nstrong preference for mainstreaming and the requirement that\nschools provide individualized programs tailored to the specific\nneeds of each disabled child.” Id. at 1214 (citations omitted).\nAs we advised in Oberti:\n\n\n       The key to resolving this tension appears to lie in\n       the school’s proper use of ‘supplementary aids and\n       services,’ which may enable the school to educate\n\n                                9\n\f       a child with disabilities for a majority of the time\n       within a regular classroom, while at the same time\n       addressing that child’s unique educational needs.\n\n\nId. (citation omitted). In sum, a court determines, through a\ncomparison of educational opportunities supported by expert\ntestimony, whether the child can be satisfactorily educated in a\nregular classroom with supplemental services. If it finds that the\nchild cannot be satisfactorily educated in that manner, the court\nmust consider whether the school attempted to mainstream the\nchild to the maximum extent possible.\n\n\nC.     Burden of Proof\n\n\n       We have always placed the burden of demonstrating\ncompliance with the IDEA on the school district. See Kingwood\nTownship, 205 F.3d at 579; Oberti, 995 F.2d at 1219. While this\nappeal was pending, however, the Supreme Court held that the\n“burden of proof in an administrative hearing challenging an IEP\nis properly placed upon the party seeking relief.” Schaffer v.\nWeast, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1993216\"><a href=\"/opinion/1993216/schaffer-v-weast/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (2005). The Schaffer Court declined\nto address the issue of whether a state could, by statute, place the\nburden exclusively upon the school district. Id. New Jersey has\nno such statute. Nevertheless, appellants contend that the rule in\nLascari v. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1936489\"><a href=\"/opinion/1936489/lascari-v-board-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), where the Supreme\nCourt of New Jersey placed the burden on the school district\nregardless of which party sought relief, is unaffected by\nSchaffer. Appellants thus attempt to avoid the application of\nSchaffer by arguing that it “does not provide the rule of law in\nNew Jersey.” (Appellants’ Letter Br.) 6\n\n\n       That argument is unavailing. The Court in Schaffer saw\nno reason to depart from “the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs\nbear the risk of failing to prove their claims,” 126 S.Ct. at 534,\n\n\n       6\n        We provided the parties an opportunity to supplement their\nbriefing in the wake of the decision in Schaffer.\n\n                                10\n\fleaving for another day whether a state can overcome that rule\nby statute. Lascari addressed that very question: where, in the\nabsence of a federal or state statutory provision providing\notherwise, should the burden of proof rest when the\nappropriateness of an IEP is challenged? Citing state and federal\nstatutory and regulatory schemes implementing not the IDEA,\nbut its precursor, the Lascari Court determined that placing the\nburden upon the school district was most appropriate. See\nLascari, 116 N.J. at 44-46. Schaffer rejected that conclusion.\nBecause this case is brought solely under the IDEA and arises in\na state lacking a statutory or regulatory provision purporting to\ndefine the burden of proof in administrative hearings assessing\nIEPs, Schaffer controls.7\n\n\n        Appellants would also have us limit the holding in\nSchaffer to the FAPE aspect of the analysis. Although, to be\nsure, the facts in Schaffer implicated only the FAPE analysis, the\nSupreme Court made it quite clear that its holding applied to the\nappropriateness of the IEP as a whole. Appellants quote limiting\nlanguage – “We hold no more than we must to resolve the case\nat hand,” Schaffer, 126 S.Ct. at 537– in arguing that the decision\ndoes not reach the LRE analysis. The Court’s holding, which\ndirectly followed the quoted language, however, vitiates that\nattempt: “The burden of proof in an administrative hearing\nchallenging an IEP is properly placed upon the party seeking\nrelief.” Id. (emphasis added). It would be unreasonable for us to\nlimit that holding to a single aspect of an IEP, where the\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         The Lascari Court described “the education of handicapped\nchildren” as “an exercise in cooperative federalism.” Lascari, 116\nN.J. at 33. It noted, however, that the relevant state and federal\nstatutes and regulations did not “address the basic issue before” it,\nnamely, “the allocation of the burden of persuasion or proof.” Id.\nat 43. Lascari filled that gap, providing the default rule previously\napplied by us as well. Schaffer precludes our continued application\nof that rule, at least to the facts of this case.\n\n                                 11\n\fquestion framed by the Court,8 and the answer it provided, do\nnot so constrict the reach of its decision.9\n\n\n       Consequently, appellants bear the burden of proof when\nchallenging the appropriateness of the relevant IEPs. In the\nproceedings before both the ALJ and the District Court, the\nburden was placed upon appellees and, in both proceedings,\nappellees prevailed. What may have been a close case pre-\nSchaffer is, in the wake of Schaffer, no longer so. As we discuss\nbelow, appellants have not carried their burden on the question\nof the appropriateness of the relevant IEPs.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n       The Court “granted certiorari to resolve the following\nquestion: At an administrative hearing assessing the\nappropriateness of an IEP, which party bears the burden of\npersuasion?” Schaffer, 126 S.Ct. at 533 (citation omitted).\n       9\n        Appellants also argue that, in the event Schaffer is deemed\napplicable and their evidence is found to be insufficient, the case\nshould be remanded “because this case was tried under controlling\nlaw which imposed the burden of proof on the school district.”\n(Appellants’ Letter Br.) Appellants do not, however, give any\nindication of what “additional evidence” they would be able to\nproduce or why, regardless of where the burden is placed, they\nwould not have submitted that evidence in pressing their claim\nduring the prior proceedings.\n\n                                12\n\f                         III. ANALYSIS 10\n\n\n       Appellants contend that their son was denied a free\nappropriate public education in the least restrictive environment\ndue to an invalid assessment of his individual needs and pursuant\nto an overarching policy against the integration of disabled\nstudents. The ALJ, after holding a six-day hearing, rejected\nthese contentions in a lengthy and extraordinarily thorough\nopinion, and the District Court affirmed.\n\n\nA.     Spring 2002 IEP\n\n\n       The central questions in the proceedings before the ALJ\nand the District Court were whether the Board carried its burden\nof demonstrating that in the spring of 2002 M.S. could not be\nsatisfactorily educated “in the regular classroom, with\nsupplementary aids and support services,” Oberti, 995 F.2d at\n1207, and whether he was, to the maximum extent appropriate,\neducated with nondisabled students. Both the ALJ and District\nCourt, having placed the burden on the Board, found that it had\ndone so.\n\n\n       Appellants contend that the District Court improperly\naffirmed the ALJ’s conflation of the FAPE analysis with the\nLRE analysis. They point to the following language in the\nALJ’s decision: “the relevant inquiry is not whether the program\nestablished for M.S. by his parents was ‘better’ for M.S.; but\n\n\n       10\n         An amicus brief in support of appellants details the\nbenefits realized by disabled children when fully included in\nmainstream educational environments. We do not question the\nintent of the IDEA, as explicitly stated in the statute, to ensure that\ndisabled students are educated “to the maximum extent\nappropriate” with nondisabled students. Our role here is simply to\nreview, under the applicable standard of review, the District\nCourt’s application of that statutory scheme to the facts of this\ncase. On that issue, the amicus brief offers little guidance.\n\n                                  13\n\fwhether the placement of M.S. in the Hubbard program for the\nspring semester of 2002 was appropriate.” (A64.) Appellants\nare correct that whether an education is “appropriate” for\npurposes of the FAPE analysis and whether a student has been\nintegrated “to the maximum extent appropriate” are distinct\nquestions. Their argument, however, that the analyses were\nconflated is unavailing. The ALJ accurately outlined the\nappropriate standards and then, in applying them, demonstrated\nan understanding of what the statute required. In stating the\nframework for decision, the ALJ correctly distinguished between\nthe FAPE and LRE analyses, and properly distilled the question\nbefore her as “whether the Hubbard School placement was the\nleast restrictive environment . . . in which M.S. could receive a\nFAPE.” (A54; see A54-57 (detailing the analytical steps\nrequired by relevant Third Circuit precedent).)\n\n\n        The ALJ’s later indication that “the relevant inquiry is not\nwhether the program established for M.S. by his parents was\n‘better’ for M.S., but whether the placement of M.S. in the\nHubbard program for the spring semester of 2002 was\nappropriate,” does on its face appear to conflate the sufficiency\nof the educational benefits for purposes of FAPE analysis with\nwhether M.S. could be more fully mainstreamed while still\nreceiving a FAPE. Nevertheless, in light of the ALJ’s earlier\ndetailed and accurate recitation of the relevant standards, this\nlanguage is most fairly read to address only the question of\nwhether the Hubbard Program was appropriate. The ALJ, as\nevidenced by her careful review of the testimony and ultimate\nconclusion that “M.S. could not receive a satisfactory\neducational opportunity in a less restrictive environment,” (A65),\ndemonstrated an understanding of the distinct LRE issue in play.\n\n\n       The District Court considered and explicitly rejected the\nargument appellants raise here, namely that the ALJ did not\nseparately address the LRE question. The Court was convinced,\nas are we, that the ALJ properly understood the legal framework\nand addressed in all material respects the facts in that light. The\nALJ, the Court found, “credit[ed] the testimony of educational\nexperts who had observed M.S.” and “held that the CST\n\n                                14\n\fseriously considered and reconsidered less restrictive placements\nfor M.S. prior to offering placement at the Hubbard Program.”\n(A97.) In the end, however, the CST “determined that such a\nplacement would not provide him with satisfactory educational\nopportunities.” (Id.) We believe that both the ALJ and the\nDistrict Judge apprehended, and in all material ways applied, the\nappropriate legal standards. What remains for us to decide is\nwhether the factual findings of the ALJ, as affirmed by the\nDistrict Court (i.e., finding appellees’ witnesses more credible\nand compelling with regard to whether M.S. could receive a\nFAPE in a less restrictive environment) were clearly erroneous.\n\n\n        The ALJ and the District Court relied upon evidence\nsupporting a finding that M.S. could not receive a satisfactory\neducation in the regular classroom and that the IEP adopted by\nappellees provided for an education in the LRE. That evidence,\nas outlined by the ALJ, included the testimony of officials and\neducators who recounted their opinion that the Hubbard School\nwas the most inclusive environment in which M.S. could receive\nan appropriate education.\n\n\n       In appellants’ estimation, however, the record is “devoid\nof any evidence to support a finding that [M.S.] could not have\nbeen educated satisfactorily in a regular classroom with\nsupplementary aids and services.” (Appellees’ Br. at 23.) They\nask us to find that the Board predetermined that M.S. would be\nin a segregated environment. In support of that contention, they\nquote Ms. Moore’s deposition testimony that she did not\ninterview the Pinnacle staff to determine whether M.S. could\ncontinue there with supplemental aids and services. That\ntestimony, however, is simply not enough to call into question,\nmuch less to counter, the evidence and testimony found credible\nby the ALJ, who opined that M.S. could not receive an\nappropriate education in an environment less restrictive than the\nHubbard School program. The fact that appellants disagree does\nnot make that evidence less substantial or render it insufficient to\nsupport a grant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                15\n\f        Appellants also argue that the Board was being\ndisingenuous when it agreed to find an integrated placement for\nM.S. in February 2002. We summarily reject that argument.\nThe Board offered its opinion regarding the proper placement of\nM.S. and appellants turned it down. In light of that rejection, the\nBoard made efforts to accommodate appellants’ wishes; indeed,\nthe efforts made on M.S.’s behalf in February 2002 were quite\nappropriately treated by the ALJ and the District Court as\nevidence of the Board’s good faith attempts to find a placement\nacceptable to appellants who, as parents, have an integral role in\nthe statutory scheme, while maintaining its view that that\nplacement was not appropriate for M.S. Moreover, the ALJ and\nthe District Court found that the Board considered a full range of\noptions for M.S., giving his situation the individualized\nassessment required by the IDEA.\n\n\n        In sum, the Board did not believe that M.S. could receive\nan appropriate education in an integrated classroom with\nsupplemental services. The ALJ, in the end, was persuaded by\nthe testimony on behalf of the Board and rejected that offered by\nappellants. The District Court believed that the ALJ’s findings\nwere supported by the record. We see no basis, particularly in\nthe wake of Schaffer, to upset those findings. Cf. Oberti, 995\nF.2d at 1222 (“In short, the parties’ experts disagreed on the\nrespective benefits of a segregated versus an integrated\nplacement for [the student], and the district court was in a better\nposition than we are to evaluate their testimony. We therefore\ndefer to that court’s findings, which, at all events, are not clearly\nerroneous.”).\n\n\nB.     Partial Reimbursement\n\n\n       The ALJ found in favor of appellants on the question of\nwhether the IEP offered adequate speech therapy, a finding\naffirmed by the District Court. The ALJ determined that “M.S.\nsuffered from severe articulation problems, which required that\nhe receive more individual speech therapy than . . . offered in the\nIEP.” (A66.) She therefore ordered the Board to partially\n\n                                 16\n\freimburse appellants for the difference between the amount of\ntime offered and the amount of time M.S. should have been\noffered for speech therapy.\n\n\n        Appellants have concluded from this that the ALJ\n“[a]llow[ed] the Board a credit for speech therapy from which\nthe ALJ explicitly determined M.S. would not benefit, in the\nabsence of any claim or evidence that the speech therapy\nprovided by M.S.’ parents was inappropriate . . . .” (Appellants’\nBr. at 51.) The ALJ clearly stated, however, that M.S. needed\nmore speech therapy than provided by the Board, not that the\nBoard’s therapy provided no benefit. We agree with the ALJ\nand the District Court that partial reimbursement was\nappropriate.11\n\n\nC.     2002-2003 IEP\n\n\n        Appellants also dispute the adequacy of the Board’s IEP\nfor the 2002-2003 school year.12 As noted above, M.S. began at\nan integrated placement in September 2002 and was offered\nsupplemental services by the Board. Appellants were satisfied\nwith the placement but objected to the provision of services by\nunnamed professionals, arguing that the Board failed to establish\nthrough its IEP that the providers would be able to provide him\nwith a FAPE. They contend that the ALJ incorrectly found that\n\n\n       11\n        The Board’s inability to carry what was then its burden on\nthis question before the ALJ does not necessarily lead to the\nconclusion that appellants on remand would be able to carry what\nis now their burden. In their letter brief following Schaffer,\nhowever, appellees did not request that this aspect of the case be\nremanded for proceedings under the burden of proof announced in\nSchaffer. We, therefore, will uphold the award of partial\nreimbursement.\n       12\n        Appellants take issue, as well, with the adequacy of the\nsupplemental services provided in the spring of 2002. We have\nconsidered the arguments raised and find them unpersuasive.\n\n                               17\n\fan IEP need only provide “some educational benefit.” (A64\n(“Clearly, the program was sufficient to provide some\neducational benefit upon M.S.”)) We see no error; indeed, the\nsame language – “some educational benefit” – is found in our\nKingwood Township decision. That decision clearly confirmed\nthat “some educational benefit” requires provision of a\n“meaningful educational benefit,” 205 F.3d at 577, the standard\nthe ALJ clearly and accurately outlined earlier in her opinion.\n\n\n       The District Court’s determination that the ALJ “did\nrequire the Board to adduce evidence to prove that the related\nservices would have conferred a meaningful educational benefit\nto M.S.” will, therefore, not be disturbed. We reject appellants’\nsuggestion that the ALJ and the District Court were stating an\nipso facto rule that all the Board needed to do was offer certified\nprofessionals. The District Court’s opinion, for example,\nevidences consideration of the actual services to be provided,\ntheir adequacy, and the certification and experience of the\nproviders. Moreover, that finding arose in the context of\nassessing whether the Board carried a burden it no longer bears.\nAppellants offered no evidence to the ALJ or to the District\nCourt, and on appeal suggest none that they could offer, calling\ninto question the qualifications of the Board’s providers of\nsupplemental services.13\n\n\nD.     § 1983\n\n\n       Finally, we reject appellants’ argument that a Board\npolicy of segregating disabled students was behind M.S.’s\nplacement. The District Court, finding no IDEA violation and\nnoting the ALJ’s supportable findings regarding individualized\n\n\n\n       13\n        Appellants also believe the IEP did not include adequate\nmeasurable goals individualized to M.S. The ALJ and District\nCourt, under the then-governing burden, found for the Board.\nWhile that finding may have presented us with a close question\nbefore, we see no basis for upsetting it now.\n\n                                18\n\fassessment, correctly granted summary judgment to appellees on\nappellants’ claim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n\n                             IV.\n\n\n       We will affirm the December 15, 2004 order of the\nDistrict Court.\n\n\n\n\n                              19\n\f</pre>",
