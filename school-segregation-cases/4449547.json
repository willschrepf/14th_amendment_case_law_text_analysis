Combs</u>, 47\nMJ 330 (1997); <u>see</u> <u>generally</u> <u>McMillian v. Johnson</u>,\n88 F.3d 1554, 1564-65 (11<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1996).\n<center>\n<p>(A)\n<br>Facts</p></center>\n\n<p>Appellant was a 38-year old Lieutenant Commander\nwith 17 years of naval service at the time of the offense, and he was assigned\nto NAS Oceana, Virginia Beach, Virginia. About sunset on the evening of\nMay 13, 1988, appellant's 31-year-old wife, Roxanne, was shot and killed\nas she entered her vehicle after shopping at a Farm Fresh supermarket in\nVirginia Beach. An assailant approached her car, stole her purse, and shot\nher twice with a handgun. The crime remained unsolved until October 1993,\nat which time appellant was arrested.\n</p><p>Lamar Brunson, who had served in the Navy with\nappellant, informed the Norfolk police that appellant had hired a hit man\nto kill his wife. The hit man was paid $5,000 shortly after the murder\nand had been promised a total of $25,000. Appellant paid<b> </b>him an\nadditional $8,000 sometime later. Shortly before his wife's death, appellant\nhad secured a $100,000 term life insurance policy on his wife's life. She\nalready had an existing life insurance policy payable in the amount of\n$25,000. Appellant was the beneficiary on both policies.\n</p><p>Appellant was kept in pretrial confinement\nfor 326 days. He alleges that during this period, he was housed in a 6-feet\nby 8-feet cell within the Disciplinary Segregation Unit. According to an\naffidavit which appellant submitted with his post-trial submissions, he\nwas kept there 23 hours a day, was fed in his cell, and was not allowed\nto talk to other prisoners. He claims he was required to sit at a small\nschool-like desk from 4:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. each day. He was not allowed\nto sit or lie on his bunk or to sleep. He was only allowed to read the\nBible or some other Christian literature.\n</p><p>Appellant initially entered a plea of not guilty\nto a premeditated murder charge but changed his plea to guilty after the\nconclusion of the Governments case. At that time, he secured a pretrial\nagreement from the convening authority. As part of the agreement, the convening\nauthority promised to withdraw the previous capital referral if appellant\nsuccessfully completed his providence inquiry to the charged offense. The\nfollowing exchange between the military judge and trial counsel took place\nbefore appellants plea was entered:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>MJ: At this time, trial counsel, you have\nan announcement to make regarding the pretrial agreement and the capital\nreferral?\n<p>TC: Yes, sir. Sir, <u>Ive been authorized\nby the convening authority that this General Court-Martials now been referred\nnoncapital</u>. That referral decision is conditioned upon your acceptance\nof a plea of guilty from the accused to the Charge and Specification, as\nwell as the pretrial agreement in this case.\n</p><p>MJ: Very well. Commander Fricke, because <u>the\nGovernment has withdrawn the capital referral at this time</u>, that gives\nyou a different option regarding forum election. . . .</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(R. at 1392).\n<p>After appellant entered his guilty plea, the\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>MJ: And, defense counsel, what advice have\nyou given the accused as to the maximum punishment for the offense of which\nhes offered to plead guilty?\n<p>IMC: Sir, Ive advised Lieutenant Commander\nFricke that the maximum punishment authorized in this case is: <u>Confinement\nfor life</u>; forfeiture of all pay and allowances; a fine; loss of all\nlineal numbers and seniority; and dismissal from the naval service.\n</p><p>MJ: Commander Fricke, you have been correctly\nadvised of the maximum punishment. On your plea of guilty alone, you could\nreceive:\n</p><p>A dismissal;\n<br><u>Confinement for life</u>;\n<br>Total forfeiture of all pay and\n<br>allowances;\n<br>A fine; and\n</p><p>Loss of all numbers, seniority or lineal\n<br>position in the Navy.\n</p><p>MJ: Do you understand that?\n<br>ACCUSED: Yes, sir.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(R. at 1395) (emphasis added).\n<p>After his trial, appellant submitted two affidavits\nto the appellate court below and made a claim for sentence credit based\non illegal pretrial punishments. One was his affidavit, and the other was\nthat of Major Bart Larsen, who was housed in the same facility as appellant\nduring appellants confinement, but as a sentenced prisoner. Appellant\nalleged, and Major Larsen corroborated, various conditions endured by appellant\nduring his pretrial confinement and that they were told these conditions\nwere imposed in an effort on the part of Brig authorities to produce a\nconfession from appellant.\n</p><p>The Government, in response to appellants\nclaims of illegal pretrial confinement and unlawful pretrial punishment,\nsubmitted an affidavit of the Director of Corrections at the Norfolk Naval\nBrig to the court below. Based solely on these three affidavits, the court\nbelow rejected appellants claims, relying on this Courts decision in\n<u>United\nStates v. Ginn</u>, 47 MJ 236 (1997). It asserted that \"[m]ost of the facts\nalleged in [appellants affidavits] . . . would not result in relief even\nif any factual dispute were resolved in appellants favor[.]\" It also\nsaid, \"Under these circumstances [two affidavits from appellant 3 years\napart] the appellate filings and the record as a whole \"compellingly demonstrate\"\nthe improbability of the remainder of appellants affidavits.\"\n<u>United\nStates v. Fricke</u>, 48 MJ at 550, quoting <u>United States v. Ginn</u>,\n47 MJ at 248. Judge Leo dissented, reasoning that \"there is no basis in\nthe appellate filings or the record as a whole to support the majoritys\nfinding that the improbability of appellants factual assertions has been\ncompellingly demonstrated on this claim of pretrial punishment.\"\n<u>Id</u>.\nat 551.\n</p><p>Appellants affidavit, as noted above, recounted\nhis belief as to why he was subjected to these \"horrific and onerous conditions\"\nof pretrial confinement. He stated in his affidavit of June 1995:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir><u>The Governments intent was clear and\nsummed up by Senior Chief Jacobs, the senior counselor assigned to the\nNaval Brig and the counselor assigned to me during my confinement there.\nSenior Chief Jacobs told me on a number of occasions that the Government\nwould keep me \"locked down until they broke\" me</u>. His comments to me\nare documented in the enclosed statement of Major Bart Larsen, an Air Force\nOfficer who was confined a portion of the time in the Brig while I was\nthere. The Senior Chief was completing his second, three-year tour of duty\nat the Naval Brig and was completing his Bachelors Degree in Criminology.\nHe was no rookie to the manner in which the Government operates and spoke\nfrom extensive experience and training.\n<center>\n<p>* * *</p></center>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, the Governments intent\nof the manner in which I was confined was aptly stated by Senior Chief\nJacobs, the senior counselor at the Brig. <u>He stated on many occasions\nit was common for the military to keep a pre-trial inmate locked down in\norder to break them and get them to confess</u>.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(Emphasis added.)\n<p>Appellant also submitted an affidavit dated\nApril 1995 from another prisoner, Major Bart Larsen. He described the conditions\nof confinement similar to appellants affidavit and he further stated:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>We were housed in adjacent cells even though\nI was an adjudged prisoner and LCDR Fricke was in pretrial confinement.\nWe had the same counselor, Senior Chief Jacobs, the senior counselor at\nthe Brig, who often talked to us together. Senior Chief Jacobs was on his\nsecond, three- year tour of duty at the Norfolk Naval Brig. <u>On several\noccasions I heard him state that many times the military would hold personnel\nin arduous pretrial confinement for a long period of time to \"break them\"\ninto confessing. He also said that LCDR Fricke \"held the brig record for\nbeing in the block longer than any previous prisoner</u>.\"</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(Emphasis added.)\n<p>The Government, in response, submitted an affidavit\nfrom the prison administrator of the Naval Brig where appellant was held\nin pretrial confinement. It stated:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>1. My name is Ronnie C. Askew. I am the Director\nof Corrections at Naval Brig, Norfolk, Virginia. I have been assigned at\nthis facility since April 1980 and was serving in this position during\nthe pretrial confinement of LCDR Fricke [sic] have personal knowledge of\nthe conditions of his confinement. The following statements are based upon\ncurrent memory.\n<p>2. <u>All individuals</u> confined are first\nassigned to a one person cell measuring approximately 6 feet wide, 8 feet\ndeep, and 10 feet high for a period of observation and custody and security\nclassification. <u>They are not required to stay in this cell at all times\nand are removed to visit their counselor, use the phone, purchase health\nand comfort items, go to the barber shop and medical if needed</u>. Due\nto the requirement to house officers separate to the extent possible from\nenlisted prisoners, LCDR Fricke was assigned to either cell block A or\nB during his confinement period. During the time frame that LCDR Fricke\nwas confined at this facility, officers were housed in the cell block area\nin order to maintain separation from enlisted prisoners. All cells at this\nfacility are designed the same, no cell or cell block is designated a specific\nstatus. The difference between special quarters and disciplinary segregation\nis based on what items the prisoner is allowed to have in his cell. Disciplinary\nsegregation also results in the loss of all privileges. <u>LCDR Fricke\nwas never placed in disciplinary segregation and was afforded all privileges\npossible</u>. In order for officer prisoners to participate in programs\nwith enlisted members the officer is required to submit a request in writing\nand state that he waives his right of separation from enlisted. To my knowledge,\nLCDR Fricke never made such a request nor did he waive his right of separation.\nI have attached copies of the daily routine for officers as contained in\nNAVBRIGNORVAINST 5000.1B (revised Oct 96 but in effect during LCDR Fricke's\nconfinement period), if LCDR Fricke did not watch TV or read other than\nthe Bible, it must have been by personal choice.\n</p><p>3. In regards to the use of restraining devices,\nLCDR Fricke was not escorted outside the Brig compound by Brig staff. The\nuse of restraints would have been a decision of the Naval Base Police Department\nwho provided escorts.\n</p><p>4. In order to prevent injury to the prisoner\nor others, chief petty officer and officer prisoners are not allowed to\nwear ribbons or collar devices at any time inside the Brig.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(Emphasis added.)\n<center>\n<p>___ ___ ___\n</p><p>(B)\n<br>Validity of Guilty Plea\n<br>(Granted Issue II)</p></center>\n\n<p>The first issue we will address in this case\nis Assigned Issue II. Appellant asks that we set aside his guilty plea\nto premeditated murder and his noncapital sentence for two reasons. First,\nhe asserts that his plea of guilty in a case referred as capital was \"void\"\nunder Article 45(b), UCMJ, 10 USC § 845(b).<sup>2</sup>\nSecond, he asserts that the military judge had no jurisdiction to accept\na plea of guilty to this offense in a case referred as capital. Article\n18, UCMJ, 10 USC § 818.<sup>3</sup>\nWe disagree.\n</p><p>The factual premise of appellants argument\nis that his case was referred capital at the time his plea of guilty to\npremeditated murder was proferred and accepted by the military judge. In\nhis final brief, he recognizes that the convening authority had agreed\nto withdraw the case as capital, if his plea of guilty was accepted by\nthe military judge. Moreover, he recognizes that the military judge did\nindeed accept his guilty plea. Nevertheless, he asserts:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>However, there is nothing in the record to\nshow that the convening authority actually withdrew the referral as a capital\ncase and re-referred it as a noncapital case. In the absence in the record\nof any paperwork by the convening authority referring the case as noncapital,\nthe case remained a capital case throughout all the proceedings, including\nthe guilty plea and sentencing phases. Therefore, at all times during the\ntrial until sentence was announced, the appellant faced the death penalty,\nand in fact, a death qualified panel remained on standby to try him for\nhis life until the start of the pre-sentencing hearing.</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\nFinal Brief at 34-35.\n<p>We are not persuaded by appellants statutory\narguments for several reasons. First, he has cited no controlling authority\nfor his assertion that \"paperwork by the convening authority referring\nthe case as noncapital\" was required. <u>See</u> <u>United States v. King</u>,\n28 MJ 397, 399 (CMA 1989); RCM 601(e)(1), Discussion, Manual for Courts-Martial,\nUnited States (1994 ed.) (nonbinding comments of drafters of Manual generally\nsuggesting \"[a]ny special instructions must be stated in the referral indorsement\");\n<u>cf</u>.\nRCM 103(2) (no express requirement that noncapital referral be stated in\ninstruction that is written). Second, his argument ignores the fact that\nthe military judge, without objection by the parties in this case, acknowledged\nthe noncapital referral of his case on the record prior to the acceptance\nof his guilty plea. (R. 1392). <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Clark</u>,\n35 MJ 432, 433 n.1 (CMA 1992); <u>cf</u>. <u>United States v. McFarlane</u>,\n8 USCMA 96, 23 CMR 320 (1957). Finally, the failure to reduce the re-referral\nto writing (not the re-referral itself) was technical in nature and did\nnot deprive appellant of the essential protections of the above-noted statutes.\n<u>See</u>\n<u>United States v. Stinson</u>, 34 MJ 233, 238 (CMA 1992), citing <u>United\nStates v. Gebhart</u>, 34 MJ 189 (CMA 1992), and <u>United States v. Jette</u>,\n25 MJ 16 (CMA 1987). Clearly, our case law has recognized that common sense\nmust prevail in these circumstances.\n<u>See</u> <u>United States v. Yates</u>,\n28 MJ 60, 63 (CMA 1989). Therefore, appellant loses on Issue II.\n</p><center>\n<p>(C)\n<br>Pretrial Punishment\n<br>(Granted Issue I)</p></center>\n\n<p>The other issue raised in this case concerns\nappellant's post-trial claim that he was unlawfully placed in pretrial\nconfinement and unlawfully punished while in that status. His initial contention\nis that, in light of his exemplary service performance, he should not have\nbeen confined solely on the basis of an allegation of a 5-year-old murder.\n<u>See</u>\nRCM 305(h)(2)(B)(iii).<sup>4</sup>\nHis second contention is that prison authorities improperly subjected him\nto excessively arduous and inhumane conditions of pretrial confinement,\nnot placed on other pretrial confinees, in order to coerce or break him\ninto confessing. He requests \"credit of five-for-one days for the 326 days\nthat he spent in pretrial confinement.\" Final Brief at 13.\n</p><p>Article 13, UCMJ, 10 USC § 813, provides:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir><b>§ 813. Art. 13. Punishment prohibited\nbefore trial</b>\n<p>No person, while being held for trial, may\nbe subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement\nupon the charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confinement\nimposed upon him be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to\ninsure his presence, but he may be subjected to minor punishment during\nthat period for infractions of discipline.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\nAbsent affirmative waiver of this issue at trial,\nwe have considered claims under this codal provision raised for the first\ntime on appeal. <u>United States v. Huffman</u>, 40 MJ 225, 227 (CMA 1994);\n<u>see</u>\n<u>United States v. Combs</u>, 47 MJ 330, 333 (1997).<sup>5</sup>\n<p>In <u>United States v. McCarthy</u>, 47 MJ\n162, 165 (1997), this Court recognized that Article 13, UCMJ, prohibits\nboth the purposeful imposition of punishment on a military accused prior\nto court-martial and pretrial confinement conditions which are more rigorous\nthan the circumstances required to ensure an accused's presence. Moreover,\nthis Court also recognized in <u>United States v. Miller</u>, 46 MJ 248,\n250 (1997), that the purposeful denial of the constitutional rights of\na servicemember while in pretrial confinement might constitute illegal\npretrial punishment permitting sentence credit. Finally, we have held that\nthe failure to object to a military magistrate or chain of command is strong\nevidence that unlawful pretrial punishment did not occur.<sup>6\n</sup><u>See</u> <u>United States\nv. Huffman</u>, <u>supra</u> at 227.\n</p><p>Our first inquiry under these principles is\nwhether appellant has raised a legal claim which, if true, would entitle\nhim to relief. <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Ginn</u>, 47 MJ at 244. He\navers, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, that for 326 days he was locked in his\ncell, 23 hours per day, 15 1/2 of which he was required to sit at a small\nwooden desk or stand nearby if he fell asleep at the desk. A majority of\nthe court below held that the facts alleged in appellant's affidavits would\nnot result in relief or were compellingly demonstrated to be improbable.\n48 MJ at 550. We disagree.\n</p><p>The conditions alleged above are not \"<u>de</u>\n<u>minimis</u>\" impositions on a pretrial detainee for which the law is\nnot concerned.\n<u>See</u> <u>Bell v. Wolfish</u>, 441 U.S. 520, 539 n.21\n(1979), quoting\n<u>Ingraham v. Wright</u>, 430 U.S. 651, 674 (1977); <u>see</u>\n<u>also</u> <u>McClanahan v. City of Moberly</u>, 35 F.Supp.2d 744, 745-46\n(E.D. Mo. 1998) (and cases cited therein). Instead, they are \"genuine privations\nand hardship over an extended period of time,\" which \"might raise serious\nquestions under the Due Process Clause as to whether those conditions amounted\nto punishment.\"\n<u>Bell v. Wolfish</u>, 441 U.S. at 542; <u>see</u> <u>also</u>\n<u>Duran v. Elrod</u>, 760 F.2d 756, 759 (7<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1985); <u>Pippins\nv. Adams County Jail</u>, 851 F.Supp. 1228, 1232 (C.D. Ill. 1994). In fact,\nas pointed out by the dissenting judge below, conditions similar to appellant's\nalleged pretrial confinement have previously been considered \"far more\nonerous than would be required to assure [appellants] presence.\" 47 MJ\nat 551 (Leo, J., dissenting), quoting <u>United States v. Palmiter</u>,\n20 MJ 90, 99 (Everett, C.J., concurring in the result). Finally, appellants\nparticular allegations, corroborated by a second prisoner with direct knowledge\nof the conditions of his confinement, were opposed by post-trial assertions\nof a prison administrator as to general prison practices. <u>Cf</u>. <u>United\nStates v. Combs</u>,\n<u>supra</u> (essentially unrebutted case).\n</p><p>In addition, coercing a confession is not a\nlegitimate governmental objective. <u>See</u> <u>Culombe v. Connecticut</u>,\n367 U.S. 568, 584 (1961) (\"neither the body nor mind of an accused may\nbe twisted until he breaks\") (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); <u>Bell</u>\n<u>v. Wolfish</u>, 441 U.S. at 539 (noting that \"if a restriction or condition\nis not reasonably related to a legitimate [government] goal . . . a court\npermissibly may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment\nthat may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees <u>qua</u> <u>detainees</u>\");\n<u>see</u>\n<u>generally</u> <u>Block v. Rutherford</u>, 468 U.S. 576, 583-84 (1984).\nHere, appellant submitted a post-trial affidavit that the confinement authorities'\nintent in imposing a continuous lockdown on him as a pretrial detainee\nwas to coerce his confession in violation of his constitutional rights.\n<u>See</u>\n<u>Hamilton v. Lyons</u>, 74 F.3d 99, 103 (5<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1996). The\nprison official's affidavit does not particularly deny this charge but\nat least impliedly disputes such an intent on the part of prison authorities.\n<u>Cf</u>.\n<u>Rapier\nv. Harris</u>, 172 F.3d 999, 1002-03 (7<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1999) (placing\npretrial detainee in solitary confinement for 270 days expressly based\non objective of maintaining safety of other inmates and jail personnel\nfound to be legitimate government purpose). In these circumstances, a factual\ndecision on the intent of the detention officials is also necessary to\ndecide whether appellant was subjected to illegal pretrial punishment.\n<u>See</u>\n<u>United States v. Ginn</u>, <u>supra</u> at 245.\n</p><p>The appropriate resolution of this unlawful\npretrial punishment claim is to remand this case for a <u>DuBay</u> hearing.\n<u>Id</u>.;\n<u>see</u>\n<u>McMillian v. Johnson</u>, 88 F.3d at 1564-65. There, the record can\nbe fully developed as to the conditions actually imposed on appellant during\nhis pretrial confinement and the intent of detention officials in imposing\nthose conditions.\n<u>See</u> <u>United States v. Fricke</u>, 48 MJ at 550-51\n(Leo, J., dissenting);\n<u>Ginn</u>, 47 MJ 236; <u>Huffman</u>, 40 MJ 225;\n<u>see</u>\n<u>also</u> <u>Bell v. Wolfish</u>, 441 U.S. at 537-39 (for test to determine\nwhether pretrial confinement constitutes unconstitutional punishment).\n</p><center>\n<p>(D)\n<br>Conclusion</p></center>\n\n<p>The decision of the United States Navy-Marine\nCorps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed as to findings but set aside\nas to sentence. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General\nof the Navy for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and\n<u>United\nStates v.

Combs</u>, 47 MJ\n330, 334 (1997)(Crawford, J., dissenting), I would hold that appellant\nhas waived his claim concerning unlawful pretrial punishment by failing\nto raise the matter before either the magistrate or the military judge.\n</p><p>Even though I would dispose of Issue I by applying\nwaiver, I find that appellants failure to complain is \"strong evidence\"\nthat he was not punished in violation of Article 13. <u>Huffman</u>, <u>supra</u>\nat 227; <u>see</u> <u>United States v. James</u>, 28 MJ 214 (CMA 1989);\n<u>United\nStates v. Palmiter</u>, 20 MJ 90, 97 (CMA 1985).\n</p><p>Appellant spent 326 days in pretrial confinement.\nHe complained for the first time in June 1995, nearly 1 year after his\ncourt-martial, that he was required to sit at a small wooden desk within\nhis 6-by-8-foot cell for 15½ hours per day, or stand \"for hours\"\nshould he fall asleep at that desk. He was not allowed to talk with other\nprisoners. He was only permitted to read the Bible or Christian literature\nby the light of one 40-watt light bulb, but was prohibited from attending\nchurch services and Bible studies. He was denied the amenities of sentenced\nprisoners: access to recreational facilities and equipment; newspapers;\ntelevision; radio; assistance organizations; and rehabilitation programs.\n</p><p>The majority is correct by concluding that\nif these allegations are true, appellant would be entitled to relief. However,\nunlike the majority, I find that the record, logic, and common sense together\n\"compellingly demonstrate\" the improbability of the facts alleged by appellant.\n<u>Cf</u>.\n<u>United\nStates v. Ginn</u>, 47 MJ 236, 248 (1997).\n</p><p>First, appellant was a 38-year-old Lieutenant\nCommander who extensively litigated the necessity for his pretrial confinement.\nYet, if one is to believe him, appellant failed to mention these \"horrific\nand onerous\" pretrial conditions either to the magistrate or the military\njudge. Second, the conditions which appellant claims he had to endure are\nstrikingly similar to those found to have existed at the Charleston Navy\nBrig, and which we found to be a violation of Article 13, in <u>United\nStates v. Palmiter</u>, <u>supra</u>. Either the Department of the Navy\nhas decided to flout the authority of this Court and reinstate pretrial\nconfinement conditions that we condemned, or appellants recitation of\nhis pretrial confinement conditions is other than reality. I suggest the\nlatter. Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Criminal Appeals decision.\n</p><p>\n</p><hr noshade width=\"75%\">\n<p>GIERKE, Judge (concurring in part and dissenting\nin part):\n</p><p>I agree with the majoritys resolution of Issue\nII. In my view, Issue I was waived. <u>United States v. Huffman</u>, 40\nMJ 225, 228-29 (CMA 1994).\n</p><p>This is one more case demonstrating the wisdom\nof the waiver rule in RCM 905(e). Appellant is not an inexperienced sailor.\nAs the majority notes, at the time of the alleged offenses in 1988, he\nwas 38-year-old commissioned officer with 17 years of service. By the time\nhe was tried in 1994, he was in his 40s and retirement eligible. He did\nnot find his conditions of pretrial confinement sufficiently onerous to\nchallenge them at trial. In my view, the result of the majority opinion\nis to allow sandbagging by this appellant, and to leave the court below\nwith a Hobsons choice of investigating a stale, 6-year-old allegation\nor giving appellant a windfall.\n</p><p>As a final note, I believe that Article 13\nissues in future guilty-plea cases could be resolved easily in a manner\nconsistent with both the majority and minority opinions in <u>Huffman</u>,\nif military judges would conclude their plea inquiry with a question whether\nthere is any claim of unlawful pretrial punishment.\n</p><p>\n</p><hr noshade width=\"75%\">\n<center>Home\nPage  <b>|</b>  Opinions\n&amp; Digest  |  Daily\nJournal  |  Scheduled\nHearings</center>\n\n\n</div>",

About sunset on the evening of\nMay 13, 1988, appellant's 31-year-old wife, Roxanne, was shot and killed\nas she entered her vehicle after shopping at a Farm Fresh supermarket in\nVirginia Beach. An assailant approached her car, stole her purse, and shot\nher twice with a handgun. The crime remained unsolved until October 1993,\nat which time appellant was arrested.\n</p><p>Lamar Brunson, who had served in the Navy with\nappellant, informed the Norfolk police that appellant had hired a hit man\nto kill his wife. The hit man was paid $5,000 shortly after the murder\nand had been promised a total of $25,000. Appellant paid<b> </b>him an\nadditional $8,000 sometime later. Shortly before his wife's death, appellant\nhad secured a $100,000 term life insurance policy on his wife's life. She\nalready had an existing life insurance policy payable in the amount of\n$25,000. Appellant was the beneficiary on both policies.\n</p><p>Appellant was kept in pretrial confinement\nfor 326 days. He alleges that during this period, he was housed in a 6-feet\nby 8-feet cell within the Disciplinary Segregation Unit. According to an\naffidavit which appellant submitted with his post-trial submissions, he\nwas kept there 23 hours a day, was fed in his cell, and was not allowed\nto talk to other prisoners. He claims he was required to sit at a small\nschool-like desk from 4:30 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. each day. He was not allowed\nto sit or lie on his bunk or to sleep. He was only allowed to read the\nBible or some other Christian literature.\n</p><p>Appellant initially entered a plea of not guilty\nto a premeditated murder charge but changed his plea to guilty after the\nconclusion of the Governments case. At that time, he secured a pretrial\nagreement from the convening authority. As part of the agreement, the convening\nauthority promised to withdraw the previous capital referral if appellant\nsuccessfully completed his providence inquiry to the charged offense. The\nfollowing exchange between the military judge and trial counsel took place\nbefore appellants plea was entered:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>MJ: At this time, trial counsel, you have\nan announcement to make regarding the pretrial agreement and the capital\nreferral?\n<p>TC: Yes, sir. Sir, <u>Ive been authorized\nby the convening authority that this General Court-Martials now been referred\nnoncapital</u>. That referral decision is conditioned upon your acceptance\nof a plea of guilty from the accused to the Charge and Specification, as\nwell as the pretrial agreement in this case.\n</p><p>MJ: Very well. Commander Fricke, because <u>the\nGovernment has withdrawn the capital referral at this time</u>, that gives\nyou a different option regarding forum election. . . .</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(R. at 1392).\n<p>After appellant entered his guilty plea, the\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>MJ: And, defense counsel, what advice have\nyou given the accused as to the maximum punishment for the offense of which\nhes offered to plead guilty?\n<p>IMC: Sir, Ive advised Lieutenant Commander\nFricke that the maximum punishment authorized in this case is: <u>Confinement\nfor life</u>; forfeiture of all pay and allowances; a fine; loss of all\nlineal numbers and seniority; and dismissal from the naval service.\n</p><p>MJ: Commander Fricke, you have been correctly\nadvised of the maximum punishment. On your plea of guilty alone, you could\nreceive:\n</p><p>A dismissal;\n<br><u>Confinement for life</u>;\n<br>Total forfeiture of all pay and\n<br>allowances;\n<br>A fine; and\n</p><p>Loss of all numbers, seniority or lineal\n<br>position in the Navy.\n</p><p>MJ: Do you understand that?\n<br>ACCUSED: Yes, sir.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(R. at 1395) (emphasis added).\n<p>After his trial, appellant submitted two affidavits\nto the appellate court below and made a claim for sentence credit based\non illegal pretrial punishments. One was his affidavit, and the other was\nthat of Major Bart Larsen, who was housed in the same facility as appellant\nduring appellants confinement, but as a sentenced prisoner. Appellant\nalleged, and Major Larsen corroborated, various conditions endured by appellant\nduring his pretrial confinement and that they were told these conditions\nwere imposed in an effort on the part of Brig authorities to produce a\nconfession from appellant.\n</p><p>The Government, in response to appellants\nclaims of illegal pretrial confinement and unlawful pretrial punishment,\nsubmitted an affidavit of the Director of Corrections at the Norfolk Naval\nBrig to the court below. Based solely on these three affidavits, the court\nbelow rejected appellants claims, relying on this Courts decision in\n<u>United\nStates v. Ginn</u>, 47 MJ 236 (1997). It asserted that \"[m]ost of the facts\nalleged in [appellants affidavits] . . . would not result in relief even\nif any factual dispute were resolved in appellants favor[.]\" It also\nsaid, \"Under these circumstances [two affidavits from appellant 3 years\napart] the appellate filings and the record as a whole \"compellingly demonstrate\"\nthe improbability of the remainder of appellants affidavits.\"\n<u>United\nStates v. Fricke</u>, 48 MJ at 550, quoting <u>United States v. Ginn</u>,\n47 MJ at 248. Judge Leo dissented, reasoning that \"there is no basis in\nthe appellate filings or the record as a whole to support the majoritys\nfinding that the improbability of appellants factual assertions has been\ncompellingly demonstrated on this claim of pretrial punishment.\"\n<u>Id</u>.\nat 551.\n</p><p>Appellants affidavit, as noted above, recounted\nhis belief as to why he was subjected to these \"horrific and onerous conditions\"\nof pretrial confinement. He stated in his affidavit of June 1995:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir><u>The Governments intent was clear and\nsummed up by Senior Chief Jacobs, the senior counselor assigned to the\nNaval Brig and the counselor assigned to me during my confinement there.\nSenior Chief Jacobs told me on a number of occasions that the Government\nwould keep me \"locked down until they broke\" me</u>. His comments to me\nare documented in the enclosed statement of Major Bart Larsen, an Air Force\nOfficer who was confined a portion of the time in the Brig while I was\nthere. The Senior Chief was completing his second, three-year tour of duty\nat the Naval Brig and was completing his Bachelors Degree in Criminology.\nHe was no rookie to the manner in which the Government operates and spoke\nfrom extensive experience and training.\n<center>\n<p>* * *</p></center>\n\n<p>As previously mentioned, the Governments intent\nof the manner in which I was confined was aptly stated by Senior Chief\nJacobs, the senior counselor at the Brig. <u>He stated on many occasions\nit was common for the military to keep a pre-trial inmate locked down in\norder to break them and get them to confess</u>.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(Emphasis added.)\n<p>Appellant also submitted an affidavit dated\nApril 1995 from another prisoner, Major Bart Larsen. He described the conditions\nof confinement similar to appellants affidavit and he further stated:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>We were housed in adjacent cells even though\nI was an adjudged prisoner and LCDR Fricke was in pretrial confinement.\nWe had the same counselor, Senior Chief Jacobs, the senior counselor at\nthe Brig, who often talked to us together. Senior Chief Jacobs was on his\nsecond, three- year tour of duty at the Norfolk Naval Brig. <u>On several\noccasions I heard him state that many times the military would hold personnel\nin arduous pretrial confinement for a long period of time to \"break them\"\ninto confessing. He also said that LCDR Fricke \"held the brig record for\nbeing in the block longer than any previous prisoner</u>.\"</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(Emphasis added.)\n<p>The Government, in response, submitted an affidavit\nfrom the prison administrator of the Naval Brig where appellant was held\nin pretrial confinement. It stated:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>1. My name is Ronnie C. Askew. I am the Director\nof Corrections at Naval Brig, Norfolk, Virginia. I have been assigned at\nthis facility since April 1980 and was serving in this position during\nthe pretrial confinement of LCDR Fricke [sic] have personal knowledge of\nthe conditions of his confinement. The following statements are based upon\ncurrent memory.\n<p>2. <u>All individuals</u> confined are first\nassigned to a one person cell measuring approximately 6 feet wide, 8 feet\ndeep, and 10 feet high for a period of observation and custody and security\nclassification. <u>They are not required to stay in this cell at all times\nand are removed to visit their counselor, use the phone, purchase health\nand comfort items, go to the barber shop and medical if needed</u>. Due\nto the requirement to house officers separate to the extent possible from\nenlisted prisoners, LCDR Fricke was assigned to either cell block A or\nB during his confinement period. During the time frame that LCDR Fricke\nwas confined at this facility, officers were housed in the cell block area\nin order to maintain separation from enlisted prisoners. All cells at this\nfacility are designed the same, no cell or cell block is designated a specific\nstatus. The difference between special quarters and disciplinary segregation\nis based on what items the prisoner is allowed to have in his cell. Disciplinary\nsegregation also results in the loss of all privileges. <u>LCDR Fricke\nwas never placed in disciplinary segregation and was afforded all privileges\npossible</u>. In order for officer prisoners to participate in programs\nwith enlisted members the officer is required to submit a request in writing\nand state that he waives his right of separation from enlisted. To my knowledge,\nLCDR Fricke never made such a request nor did he waive his right of separation.\nI have attached copies of the daily routine for officers as contained in\nNAVBRIGNORVAINST 5000.1B (revised Oct 96 but in effect during LCDR Fricke's\nconfinement period), if LCDR Fricke did not watch TV or read other than\nthe Bible, it must have been by personal choice.\n</p><p>3. In regards to the use of restraining devices,\nLCDR Fricke was not escorted outside the Brig compound by Brig staff. The\nuse of restraints would have been a decision of the Naval Base Police Department\nwho provided escorts.\n</p><p>4. In order to prevent injury to the prisoner\nor others, chief petty officer and officer prisoners are not allowed to\nwear ribbons or collar devices at any time inside the Brig.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n(Emphasis added.)\n<center>\n<p>___ ___ ___\n</p><p>(B)\n<br>Validity of Guilty Plea\n<br>(Granted Issue II)</p></center>\n\n<p>The first issue we will address in this case\nis Assigned Issue II. Appellant asks that we set aside his guilty plea\nto premeditated murder and his noncapital sentence for two reasons. First,\nhe asserts that his plea of guilty in a case referred as capital was \"void\"\nunder Article 45(b), UCMJ, 10 USC § 845(b).<sup>2</sup>\nSecond, he asserts that the military judge had no jurisdiction to accept\na plea of guilty to this offense in a case referred as capital. Article\n18, UCMJ, 10 USC § 818.<sup>3</sup>\nWe disagree.\n</p><p>The factual premise of appellants argument\nis that his case was referred capital at the time his plea of guilty to\npremeditated murder was proferred and accepted by the military judge. In\nhis final brief, he recognizes that the convening authority had agreed\nto withdraw the case as capital, if his plea of guilty was accepted by\nthe military judge. Moreover, he recognizes that the military judge did\nindeed accept his guilty plea. Nevertheless, he asserts:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>However, there is nothing in the record to\nshow that the convening authority actually withdrew the referral as a capital\ncase and re-referred it as a noncapital case. In the absence in the record\nof any paperwork by the convening authority referring the case as noncapital,\nthe case remained a capital case throughout all the proceedings, including\nthe guilty plea and sentencing phases. Therefore, at all times during the\ntrial until sentence was announced, the appellant faced the death penalty,\nand in fact, a death qualified panel remained on standby to try him for\nhis life until the start of the pre-sentencing hearing.</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\nFinal Brief at 34-35.\n<p>We are not persuaded by appellants statutory\narguments for several reasons. First, he has cited no controlling authority\nfor his assertion that \"paperwork by the convening authority referring\nthe case as noncapital\" was required. <u>See</u> <u>United States v. King</u>,\n28 MJ 397, 399 (CMA 1989); RCM 601(e)(1), Discussion, Manual for Courts-Martial,\nUnited States (1994 ed.) (nonbinding comments of drafters of Manual generally\nsuggesting \"[a]ny special instructions must be stated in the referral indorsement\");\n<u>cf</u>.\nRCM 103(2) (no express requirement that noncapital referral be stated in\ninstruction that is written). Second, his argument ignores the fact that\nthe military judge, without objection by the parties in this case, acknowledged\nthe noncapital referral of his case on the record prior to the acceptance\nof his guilty plea. (R. 1392). <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Clark</u>,\n35 MJ 432, 433 n.1 (CMA 1992); <u>cf</u>. <u>United States v. McFarlane</u>,\n8 USCMA 96, 23 CMR 320 (1957). Finally, the failure to reduce the re-referral\nto writing (not the re-referral itself) was technical in nature and did\nnot deprive appellant of the essential protections of the above-noted statutes.\n<u>See</u>\n<u>United States v. Stinson</u>, 34 MJ 233, 238 (CMA 1992), citing <u>United\nStates v. Gebhart</u>, 34 MJ 189 (CMA 1992), and <u>United States v. Jette</u>,\n25 MJ 16 (CMA 1987). Clearly, our case law has recognized that common sense\nmust prevail in these circumstances.\n<u>See</u> <u>United States v. Yates</u>,\n28 MJ 60, 63 (CMA 1989). Therefore, appellant loses on Issue II.\n</p><center>\n<p>(C)\n<br>Pretrial Punishment\n<br>(Granted Issue I)</p></center>\n\n<p>The other issue raised in this case concerns\nappellant's post-trial claim that he was unlawfully placed in pretrial\nconfinement and unlawfully punished while in that status. His initial contention\nis that, in light of his exemplary service performance, he should not have\nbeen confined solely on the basis of an allegation of a 5-year-old murder.\n<u>See</u>\nRCM 305(h)(2)(B)(iii).<sup>4</sup>\nHis second contention is that prison authorities improperly subjected him\nto excessively arduous and inhumane conditions of pretrial confinement,\nnot placed on other pretrial confinees, in order to coerce or break him\ninto confessing. He requests \"credit of five-for-one days for the 326 days\nthat he spent in pretrial confinement.\" Final Brief at 13.\n</p><p>Article 13, UCMJ, 10 USC § 813, provides:\n</p><dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir><b>§ 813. Art. 13. Punishment prohibited\nbefore trial</b>\n<p>No person, while being held for trial, may\nbe subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement\nupon the charges pending against him, nor shall the arrest or confinement\nimposed upon him be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to\ninsure his presence, but he may be subjected to minor punishment during\nthat period for infractions of discipline.</p></dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\nAbsent affirmative waiver of this issue at trial,\nwe have considered claims under this codal provision raised for the first\ntime on appeal. <u>United States v. Huffman</u>, 40 MJ 225, 227 (CMA 1994);\n<u>see</u>\n<u>United States v. Combs</u>, 47 MJ 330, 333 (1997).<sup>5</sup>\n<p>In <u>United States v. McCarthy</u>, 47 MJ\n162, 165 (1997), this Court recognized that Article 13, UCMJ, prohibits\nboth the purposeful imposition of punishment on a military accused prior\nto court-martial and pretrial confinement conditions which are more rigorous\nthan the circumstances required to ensure an accused's presence. Moreover,\nthis Court also recognized in <u>United States v. Miller</u>, 46 MJ 248,\n250 (1997), that the purposeful denial of the constitutional rights of\na servicemember while in pretrial confinement might constitute illegal\npretrial punishment permitting sentence credit. Finally, we have held that\nthe failure to object to a military magistrate or chain of command is strong\nevidence that unlawful pretrial punishment did not occur.<sup>6\n</sup><u>See</u> <u>United States\nv. Huffman</u>, <u>supra</u> at 227.\n</p><p>Our first inquiry under these principles is\nwhether appellant has raised a legal claim which, if true, would entitle\nhim to relief. <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Ginn</u>, 47 MJ at 244. He\navers, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, that for 326 days he was locked in his\ncell, 23 hours per day, 15 1/2 of which he was required to sit at a small\nwooden desk or stand nearby if he fell asleep at the desk. A majority of\nthe court below held that the facts alleged in appellant's affidavits would\nnot result in relief or were compellingly demonstrated to be improbable.\n48 MJ at 550. We disagree.\n</p><p>The conditions alleged above are not \"<u>de</u>\n<u>minimis</u>\" impositions on a pretrial detainee for which the law is\nnot concerned.\n<u>See</u> <u>Bell v.

The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General\nof the Navy for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and\n<u>United\nStates v. DuBay</u>, 17 USCMA 147, 37 CMR 411 (1967). After such proceedings\nare concluded, the record of trial, along with the military judges findings\nof fact and conclusions of law, will be returned to the Court of Criminal\nAppeals for further review under Article 66(c), Uniform Code of Military\nJustice, 10 USC § 866(c)(1994). Thereafter, Article 67(a), UCMJ, 10\nUSC § 867(a)(1994), will apply.\n</p><p><u>FOOTNOTES</u>:\n</p><p><sup>1</sup> <u>United\nStates v. DuBay</u>, 17 USCMA 147, 37 CMR 411 (1967).\n</p><p><sup>2</sup>\nArticle 45, Uniform Code of Military Justice, states:\n</p><blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>(b) A plea of\nguilty by the accused may not be received to any charge or specification\nalleging an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged.</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<sup>3</sup>\nArticle 18, UCMJ, states:\n<dir>\n<dir>\n<dir>. . . However, a general\ncourt-martial of the kind specified in section 816(1)(B) of this title\n(Article 16(1)(B)) shall not have jurisdiction to try any person for any\noffense for which the death penalty may be adjudged unless the case has\nbeen previously referred to trial as a noncapital case.</dir>\n</dir>\n</dir>\n<sup>4</sup>\nWe find no merit to this claim. <u>See</u> <u>generally</u> <u>United States\nv. Gaither</u>, 45 MJ 349, 352 (1996) (abuse-of-discretion standard).\n<p><sup>5</sup>\nIn view of appellant's unrebutted assertion that no motion\n<br>for sentence credit\nbased on unlawful pretrial punishment was made at his trial on advice of\ndefense counsel that it could be raised on appeal, we do not find a knowing\nand intelligent waiver of this issue. <u>See</u> <u>United States v. Combs</u>,\n47 MJ 331, 333-34 (1997).\n</p><p><sup>6</sup>\nAppellant's affidavit dated June 1995 clearly indicates that he repeatedly\nprotested his treatment to Senior Chief Jacobs, the senior counselor at\nthe Brig.\n</p><p>\n</p><hr noshade width=\"75%\">\n<p>CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (concurring in part and\ndissenting in part):\n</p><p>I agree with the Courts disposition of Issue\nII.  As to Issue I, consistent with my views in\n<u>United States v.\nHuffman</u>, 40 MJ 225, 228 (CMA 1994)(Crawford, J., dissenting in part\nand concurring in the result), and <u>United States v. Combs</u>, 47 MJ\n330, 334 (1997)(Crawford, J., dissenting), I would hold that appellant\nhas waived his claim concerning unlawful pretrial punishment by failing\nto raise the matter before either the magistrate or the military judge.\n</p><p>Even though I would dispose of Issue I by applying\nwaiver, I find that appellants failure to complain is \"strong evidence\"\nthat he was not punished in violation of Article 13. <u>Huffman</u>, <u>supra</u>\nat 227; <u>see</u> <u>United States v. James</u>, 28 MJ 214 (CMA 1989);\n<u>United\nStates v. Palmiter</u>, 20 MJ 90, 97 (CMA 1985).\n</p><p>Appellant spent 326 days in pretrial confinement.\nHe complained for the first time in June 1995, nearly 1 year after his\ncourt-martial, that he was required to sit at a small wooden desk within\nhis 6-by-8-foot cell for 15½ hours per day, or stand \"for hours\"\nshould he fall asleep at that desk. He was not allowed to talk with other\nprisoners. He was only permitted to read the Bible or Christian literature\nby the light of one 40-watt light bulb, but was prohibited from attending\nchurch services and Bible studies. He was denied the amenities of sentenced\nprisoners: access to recreational facilities and equipment; newspapers;\ntelevision; radio; assistance organizations; and rehabilitation programs.\n</p><p>The majority is correct by concluding that\nif these allegations are true, appellant would be entitled to relief. However,\nunlike the majority, I find that the record, logic, and common sense together\n\"compellingly demonstrate\" the improbability of the facts alleged by appellant.\n<u>Cf</u>.\n<u>United\nStates v. Ginn</u>, 47 MJ 236, 248 (1997).\n</p><p>First, appellant was a 38-year-old Lieutenant\nCommander who extensively litigated the necessity for his pretrial confinement.\nYet, if one is to believe him, appellant failed to mention these \"horrific\nand onerous\" pretrial conditions either to the magistrate or the military\njudge. Second, the conditions which appellant claims he had to endure are\nstrikingly similar to those found to have existed at the Charleston Navy\nBrig, and which we found to be a violation of Article 13, in <u>United\nStates v. Palmiter</u>, <u>supra</u>. Either the Department of the Navy\nhas decided to flout the authority of this Court and reinstate pretrial\nconfinement conditions that we condemned, or appellants recitation of\nhis pretrial confinement conditions is other than reality. I suggest the\nlatter. Accordingly, I would affirm the Court of Criminal Appeals decision.\n</p><p>\n</p><hr noshade width=\"75%\">\n<p>GIERKE, Judge (concurring in part and dissenting\nin part):\n</p><p>I agree with the majoritys resolution of Issue\nII. In my view, Issue I was waived. <u>United States v. Huffman</u>, 40\nMJ 225, 228-29 (CMA 1994).\n</p><p>This is one more case demonstrating the wisdom\nof the waiver rule in RCM 905(e). Appellant is not an inexperienced sailor.\nAs the majority notes, at the time of the alleged offenses in 1988, he\nwas 38-year-old commissioned officer with 17 years of service. By the time\nhe was tried in 1994, he was in his 40s and retirement eligible. He did\nnot find his conditions of pretrial confinement sufficiently onerous to\nchallenge them at trial. In my view, the result of the majority opinion\nis to allow sandbagging by this appellant, and to leave the court below\nwith a Hobsons choice of investigating a stale, 6-year-old allegation\nor giving appellant a windfall.\n</p><p>As a final note, I believe that Article 13\nissues in future guilty-plea cases could be resolved easily in a manner\nconsistent with both the majority and minority opinions in <u>Huffman</u>,\nif military judges would conclude their plea inquiry with a question whether\nthere is any claim of unlawful pretrial punishment.\n</p><p>\n</p><hr noshade width=\"75%\">\n<center>Home\nPage  <b>|</b>  Opinions\n&amp; Digest  |  Daily\nJournal  |  Scheduled\nHearings</center>\n\n\n</div>",
