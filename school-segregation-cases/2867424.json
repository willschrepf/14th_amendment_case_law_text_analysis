We\n\nconclude that such a practice does not violate the ADEA, and\n\ntherefore we will reverse the judgment of the district court.\n\nBecause there is no basis for further proceedings in this case,\n\nwe will remand the matter to the district court with instructions\n\nto enter judgment for the defendant.\n\n\n  I.   INTRODUCTION, FACTUAL BACKGROUND, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\f            The germane facts are not disputed.1   In 1990, the\n\nemployer, defendant SmithKline Beecham Corporation (SmithKline),\n\na Philadelphia-based pharmaceutical company, consolidated four\n\ncomputer data centers it operated throughout Pennsylvania and in\n\nTennessee into a single center at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\n\nPrior to the consolidation, SmithKline employed plaintiff John\n\nDiBiase as a first-shift supervisor of computer operators at its\n\nPhiladelphia data center.    With the consolidation, he moved to\n\nKing of Prussia, where six supervisors remained employed, working\n\ntwo per shift, with each pair overseeing three to five computer\n\noperators.    Between late 1991 and early 1992, SmithKline decided\n\nto reduce the staff of this division, and it assessed the\n\nconcomitant consequences.    Specifically, the data center's\n\npersonnel manager \"prepared an 'adverse impact analysis'\n\nexamining the gender, race, and age of the shift supervisors to\n\ndetermine if any adverse impact would result from the planned\n\nreduction in staff.\"    DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 343.   On February\n\n1, 1992, SmithKline decided to lay off DiBiase and one other\n\nshift supervisor and it informed DiBiase of this decision the\n\nnext day.    At that time, he was 51 years old.\n\n            SmithKline offered employees terminated in a RIF a\n\nseparation benefit plan, which provided a lump sum payment based\n\non the employee's length of service, as well as continued health\n\n1\n . Unless otherwise noted, we take the facts from the district\ncourt opinion. DiBiase v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 847 F. Supp.\n341 (E.D. Pa. 1994).\n\fand dental benefits.   Specifically, the basic plan provided 12\n\nmonths salary and three months continued benefits.    Additionally,\n\nthe plan offered enhanced benefits to employees willing to sign a\n\ngeneral release of all claims against SmithKline.    Terminated\n\nemployees who signed the release were entitled to receive 15\n\nmonths salary and six months continued health and dental\n\ncoverage.   The release is in large part the subject of this\n\nappeal, and it stated in pertinent part:\n               In consideration of the monies and other\n          consideration to be received by me under the\n          SmithKline Beecham Separation Program, I\n          hereby irrevocably and unconditionally\n          release, waive and forever discharge\n          SmithKline Beecham Corporation, its\n          affiliates, parents, successors,\n          predecessors, subsidiaries, assigns,\n          directors, officers, employees,\n          representatives, agents, and attorneys . . .\n          from any and all claims, agreements, causes\n          of action, demands, or liabilities of any\n          nature whatsoever . . . arising, occurring or\n          existing at any time prior to the signing of\n          this General Release, whether known or\n          unknown.\n\n\nGeneral release ยง 1 at app. 98.   The release provided that\n\nemployees who sign it waive\n          [a]ny and all claims arising under federal,\n          state, or local constitutions, laws, rules or\n          regulations or common law prohibiting\n          employment discrimination based upon age,\n          race, color, sex, religion, handicap or\n          disability, national origin or any other\n          protected category or characteristic,\n          including but not limited to any and all\n          claims arising under the Age Discrimination\n          in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, the\n          Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights\n          Acts of 1866 or 1871, the National Labor\n\f            Relations Act and/or under any other federal,\n            state or local human rights, civil rights, or\n            employment discrimination statute, rule or\n            regulation.\n\n\nRelease ยง 1 ยถ2 at app. 98.    Prefatory language to the release\n\ncautioned employees that \"YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY REVIEW AND\n\nUNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND EFFECT OF THE SEPARATION\n\nPROGRAM AND OF THIS GENERAL RELEASE.      THEREFORE, PLEASE CONSIDER\n\nIT FOR AT LEAST TWENTY-ONE (21) DAYS BEFORE SIGNING IT.      YOU ARE\n\nADVISED TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE YOU SIGN THIS GENERAL\n\nRELEASE.\"    Release at app. 98.   Under the terms of the release,\n\nemployees were given seven calendar days after signing to revoke\n\ntheir signature.    Release at app. 99.\n\n            DiBiase declined to sign the release.   Instead, on\n\nApril 29, 1992, he wrote a letter to William Mossett,\n\nSmithKline's personnel director, contending that SmithKline's\n\npolicy violated the ADEA. The letter reads in pertinent part:\n               So there can be no possible\n          misunderstanding I am stating my position as\n          follows.\n\n                               * * *\n                 As stated in my grievance I have reason\n            to believe that the company violated federal\n            and state age discrimination laws in\n            terminating me. I am declining the enhanced\n            separation benefit package because I do not\n            wish to give up my rights under these\n            discrimination laws. I believe that the\n            company's policy of requiring persons over\n            forty to release age discrimination claims\n            against the company in order to secure\n            enhanced separation benefits violates these\n            age discrimination laws since persons under\n            forty may elect to receive enhanced\n            separation benefits determined by the same\n\f            formula that applies to persons over forty\n            without releasing potential age\n            discrimination claims.\n\n\nLetter from DiBiase to Mossett of April 29, 1992, at app. 106,\n\n107.    Because DiBiase did not sign the release, SmithKline\n\nrefused to give him the enhanced benefits.    See Letter from\nTyrone Barber, SmithKline's Personnel Manager, to DiBiase of May\n\n4, 1992, at app. 108.    Still, DiBiase received the benefits due\n\nhim under SmithKline's basic plan. Id.\n\n            On July 2, 1992, DiBiase filed an affidavit and charge\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging\n\nboth that SmithKline terminated his employment because of his\n\nage, and that SmithKline's separation plan violated the ADEA\n\nbecause it treated older workers differently than younger workers\n\nby requiring them to release ADEA claims.    DiBiase EEOC aff. at\n\napp. 109-110.    On March 31, 1993, the EEOC determined that \"there\n\nis not reasonable cause to believe that there has been a\n\nviolation of the statute under which the charge has been filed.\"\n\nEEOC Determination at app. 67-68.\n\n            On June 14, 1993, DiBiase filed a complaint against\n\nSmithKline in the United States District Court for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.    His amended complaint contained two\n\ncounts.    Count 1 asserted that SmithKline fired him because of\n\nhis age, in violation of the ADEA.    Complaint ยถ 15-19 at app. 55-\n\n56.    Count 2 alleged that SmithKline's \"separation benefit plan\n\nviolates ADEA because it discriminates against [him] and its\n\fother employees forty or older by having higher requirements for\n\nthem to qualify for the additional separation benefits than apply\n\nto its employees under forty.\"    Complaint ยถ 29 at app. 58.\n\nDiBiase also asserted that SmithKline's actions underlying both\n\ncounts were willful and that he was entitled to punitive and\n\ndouble damages.   Complaint ยถยถ   19, 31 at app. 56, 59.   On August\n\n2, 1993, SmithKline moved to dismiss count 2 of the amended\n\ncomplaint, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).    In a Memorandum\n\nopinion and order filed on September 29, 1993, the district court\n\ndenied the motion.   The district court suggested that DiBiase\n\nmight be able to show that even if SmithKline's plan was a\n\n\"facially neutral employment\" policy, it \"had a significantly\n\ndiscriminatory impact.\"   Memorandum Op. at app. 47.\n\n           On December 20, 1993, SmithKline moved for summary\n\njudgment on both counts of DiBiase's complaint.    In an opinion\n\nand order dated March 15, 1994 -- entered the next day and\n\nreported at 847 F. Supp. 341 (E.D. Pa. 1994) -- the district\n\ncourt granted the motion as to Count 1 and denied it as to Count\n\n2.   Specifically, the district court found that \"no jury\n\nreasonably could conclude from the facts\" that DiBiase had been\n\nreplaced in his job.   847 F. Supp. at 346.   Inasmuch as DiBiase\n\nhad not been replaced, the court concluded that he had failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of wrongful termination under the\n\fADEA.   Thus, the district court granted summary judgment to\n\nSmithKline on the termination count, count 1.2\n\n           However, the district court denied SmithKline's motion\n\nfor summary judgment on count 2.     Specifically, the court found\n\nthat the separation plan involved discriminatory treatment of\n\nolder persons.    Relying on the ADEA section providing a cause of\n\naction only for persons at least 40 years old, see 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n631(a), the district court observed that \"[i]n order for an older\n\nemployee to receive the same enhanced benefit as a younger\n\nemployee, the older employee must release her right to file an\n\nADEA claim.\"     DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 347.   The court further\n\nobserved that \"[t]his treatment is patently different because the\n\nyounger employee cannot have an ADEA claim.\"      Id.   From these\n\nobservations, the district court concluded that \"SmithKline's\n\npolicy facially discriminates\" against employees protected by the\n\nADEA.   Id. at 348.   Thus, the court denied SmithKline's motion.\n\n\n2\n . Ordinarily, when employment is terminated as part of a RIF,\nthe plaintiff need not prove that he or she was replaced by a\nworker outside the protected class. Rather, to demonstrate a\nprima facie case \"[i]n RIF cases, the plaintiff must show he was\nin the protected class, he was qualified, he was laid off and\nother unprotected workers were retained.\" Armbruster v. Unisys\nCorp., 32 F.3d 768, 777 (3d Cir. 1994). Here, the district court\nfound that \"[p]laintiff cannot make such a showing, however,\nbecause all three retained employees . . . were within the\nprotected class when plaintiff was terminated.\" DiBiase, 847 F.\nSupp. at 345 n.5. Thus, the district court used the standard for\nestablishing a prima facie case in the typical age discrimination\ncase. We need not address whether the district court\nappropriately departed from traditional RIF analysis, because\nDiBiase has not appealed from the summary judgment on count 1.\n\f            On April 26, 1994, DiBiase made a cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment on count 2 of the amended complaint, based\n\nentirely on the district court's reasoning in its March 15, 1994\n\nopinion.3   On May 3, 1994, the district court granted this\n\nmotion, \"[f]or the reasons fully set forth in my March 15, 1994\n\nOpinion.\"    May 3, 1994 Order at n.1.   Because the parties had\n\nstipulated to damages under count 2, the district court entered\n                                                           4\njudgment for DiBiase in the amount of $14,203.03.    Id.\n\n            Meanwhile, on December 16, 1993, DiBiase had filed\n\nanother action alleging that SmithKline had retaliated against\n\nhim for pursuing his rights under the ADEA.    On December 22,\n\n1993, the district court consolidated the two actions.         The\n\nparties settled the retaliation claim, and on April 29, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court signed a stipulation and order (entered on May 2,\n\n1994) dismissing that claim with prejudice.    Thus, the May 3,\n\n1994 order granting DiBiase's motion for summary judgment on\n\ncount 2 concluded the proceedings before the district court.\n\nSmithKline timely filed a notice of appeal.    We have jurisdiction\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291 and the district court had subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. ยง 626(c) and 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1331.\n\n\n3\n . Technically this motion was not a cross-motion, since it was\nmade after the district court's order on the original motion.\nNonetheless, the district court, the parties and the docket sheet\ndescribe it as a \"cross-motion\" and we follow suit.\n4\n.   It is unclear how the parties arrived at this figure.\n\f          We exercise plenary review over the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment, Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v.\n\nDarling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1230 (3d Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 114 S.Ct. 554 (1993), and, because the facts are\n\nundisputed, we decide the appeal as a matter of law.\n\n\n                          II.    DISCUSSION\n\n                         A.     Introduction\n\n          This case involves the scope of liability under the\n\nADEA, a federal anti-discrimination statute that renders it\n\nunlawful for an employer:\n          (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n          any individual or otherwise discriminate\n          against any individual with respect to his\n          compensation, terms, conditions, or\n          privileges of employment, because of such\n          individual's age;\n\n          (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n          employees in any way which would deprive or\n          tend to deprive any individual of employment\n          opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n          his status as an employee, because of such\n          individual's age.\n\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a).5   With these provisions, \"[t]he ADEA 'broadly\n\nprohibits arbitrary discrimination in the workplace based on\n\nage.'\"   Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111,\n\n5\n . We generally rely on both ADEA cases and cases arising under\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 2000e, et\nseq., because \"Title VII and the ADEA have been given parallel\nconstructions due to their similarities in purpose and\nstructure.\" Oshiver v. Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, 38 F.3d\n1380, 1385 n.4 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\f120, 105 S.Ct. 613, 621 (1985) (quoting Lorillard v. Pons, 434\n\nU.S. 575, 577, 98 S.Ct. 866, 868 (1978)).6   In a \"privilege of\n\nemployment\" case such as this one, it is irrelevant that\n\nSmithKline had no obligation to provide the particular benefit to\n\nits employees, for once an employer decides to grant an\n\nopportunity to some, \"it may not deny this opportunity to others\n\nbecause of their age.\"   Thurston, 469 U.S. at 121, 105 S.Ct. at\n\n621.   As the Supreme Court has explained, \"'[a] benefit that is\n\npart and parcel of the employment relationship may not be doled\n\nout in a discriminatory fashion, even if the employer would be\n\nfree . . . not to provide the benefit at all.'\"   Id. (alteration\n\nin original) (quoting Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 75,\n\n104 S.Ct. 2229, 2233-34 (1984)).\n\n           SmithKline argues in the first instance that Congress,\n\nin enacting the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, Pub. L. No.\n\n101-43, 104 Stat. 978 (1990) (OWBPA), explicitly considered and\n\nrejected a provision entitling older workers to extra\n\nconsideration for release of ADEA claims.7   The OWBPA set forth,\n\n6\n . As noted above, however, the statute provides that \"[t]he\nprohibitions in this chapter shall be limited to individuals who\nare at least 40 years of age.\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 631(a).\n7\n . Somewhat inexplicably, at oral argument DiBiase vigorously\ndenied that his theory of the case required employers to provide\nextra consideration to older workers signing general releases.\nTo the contrary, he said that a provision for extra consideration\nwould violate the ADEA as well and that the only way in which\nolder people would be treated the same as younger people would be\nto allow older people to sign a release agreeing to waive all\nclaims except those under the ADEA.\n\famong other things, specific standards governing whether an\n\nemployee's waiver of ADEA claims is valid.   See 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n626(f).   SmithKline points out that early drafts of the OWBPA\n\nprovided that a waiver of ADEA claims is valid only when:\n          the rights or claims are waived in exchange\n          for consideration in addition to anything of\n          value --\n\n               (ii) that has been offered to a group or\n               class of individuals under an early\n               retirement incentive or other employment\n               termination program.\n\n\nSee 135 Cong. Rec. ยง 289-01, ยง 356-57 (introduction of bill in\nSenate); 135 Cong. Rec. H 696-03, H 697 (introduction of bill in\n\nHouse of Representatives).   SmithKline is correct in noting that\n(..continued)\n          However, this case has proceeded on the assumption that\nDiBiase was claiming extra consideration. In ruling on\nSmithKline's motion to dismiss, the district court stated that\nDiBiase \"argues that an employer could secure a release of ADEA\nclaims by offering additional consideration beyond that offered\nfor a release of all claims except ADEA claims.\" Memorandum of\nSeptember 27, 1993, at app. 47. Similarly, the district court\ncommented in its opinion that \"I have difficulty believing that\nthe widespread industry practice of offering enhanced benefits in\nexchange for a release of potential claims is so fragile that a\ndecision requiring additional consideration for a valid release\nof ADEA claims will cause the practice to expire.\" DiBiase, 847\nF. Supp. at 351. In short, the district court certainly believed\nthat DiBiase was asking for extra consideration.\n\n          At any rate, unless DiBiase is arguing that an employer\nnever could secure a valid general release from a terminated\nemployee protected by the ADEA, we perceive no analytical\ndistinction between a claim for extra consideration and a claim\nthat DiBiase should have been allowed to waive all claims except\nADEA claims in exchange for the enhanced benefits. Both\narguments seek special treatment. In the former situation, the\nolder worker receives extra money. In the latter situation, the\nolder employee preserves his or her ADEA claims.\n\fCongress did not include the provision in the OWBPA.     This\n\nhistory supporting SmithKline's position is significant and is\n\nentitled to some weight.    See United States v. Alcan Aluminum\n\nCorp., 964 F.2d 252, 264-65 (3d Cir. 1992).    However, we do not\n\nrely primarily on legislative history in resolving this case\n\nbecause, as the following discussion shows, it is evident that\n\neven if we disregard the history we must conclude that\n\nSmithKline's policy did not violate the substantive provisions of\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n            With this said, we now assess whether SmithKline's\n\npolicy of providing enhanced benefits only to terminated\n\nemployees signing the release violated the ADEA.     A policy can be\n\ndiscriminatory because of its treatment of or impact on\n\nemployees.     In a disparate treatment case \"'[t]he employer simply\n\ntreats some people less favorably than others because of their\n\nrace, color, religion [or other protected characteristics].'\"\n\nHazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, ____ U.S. ____, ____, 113 S.Ct. 1701,\n\n1705 (1993) (first alteration added) (quoting Teamsters v. United\n\nStates, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1855 n.15 (1977)).\n\nOn the other hand, disparate impact liability \"'involve[s]\n\nemployment practices that are facially neutral in their treatment\n\nof different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one\n\ngroup than another and cannot be justified by business\n\nnecessity.'\"     Id. (quoting Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335 n.15, 97\nS.Ct. at 1855 n.15).\n\f          DiBiase contends -- and the district court found --\n\nthat older workers who signed SmithKline's release gave up more\n\nclaims than younger workers who signed the release, since older\n\nworkers, unlike younger workers, are protected by the ADEA.\n\nBecause the argument is framed to contend that SmithKline treated\n\nolder persons less favorably than younger persons, this\n\narticulation of the claim falls under the rubric of \"disparate\n\ntreatment.\"\n\n\n                    B.   Disparate treatment\n\n          As the Supreme Court has noted, \"'[d]isparate treatment\n\n. . . is the most easily understood type of discrimination.'\"\n\nHazen, ____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1705 (alteration added)\n\n(quoting Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 335 n.15, 97 S.Ct. at 1855 n.15).\n\nA successful disparate treatment case prevents an employer from\n\nintentionally engaging in discrimination or grants a remedy\n\nagainst it for such conduct.   Thus, \"[d]isparate treatment . . .\n\ncaptures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the\n\nADEA.\"   Id. at   , 113 S.Ct. at 1706.   For example, as the\n\nSupreme Court pointed out when considering an employment\n\ntermination case, \"[i]t is the very essence of age discrimination\n\nfor an older employee to be fired because the employer believes\n\nthat productivity and competence decline with old age.\"    Id.   In\n\na disparate treatment case, the trier of fact asks not whether\n\nthe employer's otherwise nondiscriminatory policy has some\n\fadverse effect on members of the protected class, but rather, \"is\n\n'the employer . . . treating \"some people less favorably than\n\nothers because of their [age].\"'\"    U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of\n\nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 715, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482\n\n(1983) (emphasis added) (quoting Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters,\n\n438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949 (1978) (second internal\n\nquotation omitted)).   Usually, disparate treatment involves an\n\nad-hoc decision to treat an individual adversely because he or\n\nshe is in a particular protected class.    For example, in Anderson\n\nv. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 578, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (1985),\n\nthe district court found disparate treatment liability based on\n\nsex when a city refused to hire a qualified woman for the\n\nposition of recreation director.    Id. at 580, 105 S.Ct. at 1515.\n\n\"Whatever the employer's decision-making process, a disparate\n\ntreatment claim cannot succeed unless the employee's protected\n\ntrait actually played a role in that process and had a\n\ndeterminative influence on the outcome.\"   Id. at ____, 113 S.Ct.\n\nat 1706.   Nonetheless, the district court found, and DiBiase\n\nargues, that he did not have to meet this test, because the\n\npolicy constitutes explicit facial discrimination.\n\n           We agree that when a policy facially discriminates on\n\nthe basis of the protected trait, in certain circumstances it\n\n\"may constitute per se or explicit [age] discrimination.\"     EEOC\n\nv. Elgin Teachers Ass'n, 780 F. Supp. 1195, 1197 (N.D. Ill.\n\n1991).   And, \"[w]hether an employment practice involves disparate\n\ftreatment through explicit facial discrimination does not depend\n\non why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit\n\nterms of the discrimination.\"   Int'l Union, UAW v. Johnson\n\nControls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199, 111 S.Ct. 1196, 1204 (1991).\n\nThis is because, in a facial disparate treatment case, the\n\nprotected trait by definition plays a role in the decision-making\n\nprocess, inasmuch as the policy explicitly classifies people on\n\nthat basis.   Thus, when the policy itself displays the unlawful\n\ncategorization, the employee is relieved from independently\n\nproving intent.   See Hazen, ____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1705\n\n(while \"'proof of discriminatory motive is critical, . . . it can\n\nin some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences\n\nin treatment. . . .'\") (citation omitted).\n\n            The district court based its conclusion that the policy\n\nconstitutes facial discrimination on the following reasoning.\n\nThe ADEA provides a cause of action only to persons age 40 or\n\nolder.   By its terms, then, the ADEA differentiates employees on\n\nthe basis of age, and leaves younger workers unprotected by the\n\nstatute.8   Thus, on their 40th birthday, workers gain a\n\nsubstantive, valuable right.    By contrast, nearly all other\n\njudicially enforceable rights apply to all persons, not to\n\n\n8\n . As one court has noted, \"[t]he House Report for [the ADEA]\ncited the example of airline stewardesses, who must apparently\n'retire' by the age of 32, as people beset by an obvious age\ndiscrimination problem, yet who will have no remedy under the\n[ADEA].\" Kodish v. United Airlines, Inc., 463 F. Supp. 1245,\n1249 (D. Colo. 1979), aff'd, 628 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1980).\n\fpersons whose immutable characteristic falls in a particular\n\ncategory.    For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nprotects not just black workers, but whites as well.    Males as\n\nwell as females may bring successful gender-discrimination suits.\n\nAnd, in states with statutes prohibiting discrimination on the\n\nbasis of sexual orientation, presumably heterosexuals are\n\nprotected as well as homosexuals.    The district court next\n\nreasoned that, because the ADEA does not protect younger workers,\n\nwhile these other rights apply to all, older workers by\n\ndefinition hold a total number of rights greater than the total\n\nnumber of rights younger workers hold.   Hence, if younger workers\n\nhold rights with the total value of x, older workers have x + 1\n\nrights.   In light of this analysis, the court reasoned that older\n\nterminated workers have more accrued claims to give up than\n\nyounger workers.    Thus, in order to comply with the ADEA,\n\nSmithKline should have given extra consideration to older workers\n\nbecause by signing the release they were giving up more claims\n\nthan younger workers.    Accordingly, the court concluded that, by\n\ntreating older workers the same as younger workers, SmithKline\n\nfacially and explicitly discriminated on the basis of age.\n\n            We reject the district court's reasoning and thus we\n\nhold that it erred in concluding that SmithKline's policy is\n\nfacially discriminatory and therefore constitutes per se\ndiscrimination.    The touchstone of explicit facial discrimination\n\nis that the discrimination is apparent from the terms of the\n\fpolicy itself.   In Thurston, for example, an airline company's\n\npolicy constituted facial discrimination independent of proof of\n\nintent because it allowed all disqualified pilots automatically\n\nto be transferred to the position of flight engineer except those\n\ndisqualified on the basis of age.    Thurston, 469 U.S. at 121, 105\n\nS.Ct. at 622.    In Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 197, 111 S.Ct. at\n\n1202, the policy at issue violated Title VII because it\n\n\"exclude[d] women with childbearing capacity from lead-exposed\n\njobs and so create[d] a facial classification based on gender.\"\n\nSimilarly, Los Angeles Dep't of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435\n\nU.S. 702, 98 S.Ct. 1370 (1978), prohibited a policy that facially\n\n\"require[d] 2,000 individuals to contribute more money into a\n\nfund than 10,000 other employees simply because each of them\n\n[was] a woman, rather than a man.\"   Id. at 711, 98 S.Ct. at 1377.\n\n          But SmithKline's policy does not fall within that\n\nlimited category of cases.   Its plan cannot be said to be\n\ndiscriminatory on its face, because the district court's\n\nconclusion that the plan is facially discriminatory required\n\nreferencing a fact outside the policy -- namely the ADEA.\n\nConsider the district court's holding:   \"Because ADEA provides a\n\ncause of action for age discrimination only to persons age forty\n\nand above, the Plan explicitly treats older employees differently\n\nthan younger employees.\"   DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 347.     But the\n\nword \"explicitly\" does not belong.   It is impossible to examine\n\nSmithKline's policy and conclude that on its face it treats older\n\fworkers disparately.   There is a good reason for this -- the\n\npolicy does not classify persons on the basis of age.   On the\n\ncontrary, the plan offering is an archetypical example of a\n\nfacially non-discriminatory policy.   SmithKline made the expanded\n\npackage available to all persons willing to sign the release,\n\nregardless of age.   SmithKline did not require employees to waive\n\nonly ADEA claims, but to waive all claims.   A facially non-\n\ndiscriminatory policy cannot be transformed into a facially\n\ndiscriminatory policy simply because of the existence of the\n\nADEA.9\n\n\n9\n .    While our result is not dependent on this point, we observe\nthat certain precedents suggest that the premise that only\nemployees 40 or over have anything to surrender under the ADEA is\nwrong. Thus, it has been held that employees under the age of 40\nmay bring retaliation claims under section 4(d) of the ADEA, see\nAnderson v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 722 F. Supp. 668, 671-72 (D.\nKan. 1989). Moreover, at least two courts have held that,\ndespite the statutory provision to the contrary, workers under\nthe age of 40 may have standing to sue for substantive age\ndiscrimination. In Johnson v. Mayor and City Council of\nBaltimore, 515 F. Supp. 1287, 1301 (D.Md. 1981), rev'd on other\ngrounds, 731 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1984), the court held that a 32-\nyear old plaintiff had standing to challenge the company's early\nretirement policy because \"[the standing] provision does no more\nthan define the acts prohibited by the statute and would not\ndeprive plaintiff . . . of standing in this case.\" Id. In Allen\nv. American Home Foods, Inc., 644 F. Supp. 1553, 1558 (N.D. Ind.\n1986), the court held that employees under 40 had standing to sue\nunder the ADEA when they were terminated in the wake of a plant\nclosing. Our point is not that these cases were decided\ncorrectly, a conclusion we neither reach nor reject. Rather, our\npoint is that the provisions of the ADEA -- and how they are\ninterpreted -- are outside an employer's control. Moreover, the\n30-year old's suit certainly imposes costs upon the company, and\nonce the suit is filed, it cannot be said that the costs will be\ncontained by an early dismissal. These facts make it even more\ndifficult to make the blanket statement that older persons'\n\f           Thus, DiBiase is left with having to prove both unequal\n\ntreatment and intent to discriminate.   See Hazen, ____ U.S. at\n\n____, 113 S.Ct. at 1705; Armbruster v. Unisys Corp., 32 F.3d 768,\n\n782 (3d Cir. 1994); Fuentes v. Perskie, 32 F.3d 759, 764 (3d Cir.\n\n1994).   The Supreme Court plainly has stated that \"there is no\n\ndisparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the\n\nemployer is some feature other than the employee's age.\"    Hazen,\n\n____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1705.   Here, the record does not\n\ncontain even the slightest evidence of discriminatory motive.10\n\n          At any rate, even assuming the existence of a\n\n(..continued)\nclaims are worth more than younger persons' claims.   See\ngenerally Typescript at 21-24.\n10\n . In Hazen, the Supreme Court held that discrimination based\non pension eligibility (when pension eligibility was based on\nyears of service) does not violate the ADEA despite the strong\ncorrelation between the two categories. The Court did say,\nhowever, that \"[w]e do not preclude the possibility that an\nemployer who targets employees with a particular pension status\non the assumption that these employees are likely to be older\nthereby engages in age discrimination. Pension status may be a\nproxy for age . . . in the sense that the employer may suppose a\ncorrelation between the two factors and act accordingly.\" Hazen,\n___ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1707. Here, there is nothing in\nthe record to indicate that SmithKline, by offering the general\nrelease, intended to target older workers. In fact, its motive\nis quite obvious -- it wanted to protect itself against all\nlitigation arising out of the RIF.\n\n          DiBiase also contends that the intent to discriminate\ncan be inferred based on his letter to SmithKline charging\nSmithKline with violating the ADEA. This is preposterous. The\nlogical consequence of the argument is that a terminated employee\ncan manufacture an illicit intent on the part of the employer\nsimply by telling the employer that he or she thinks the employer\nis violating an anti-discrimination law.\n\flegitimate factual dispute concerning SmithKline's motive, it\n\nsimply did not discriminate against DiBiase on the basis of age.\n\nAgain, we begin with the district court's reasoning.   The\n\ndistrict court properly concluded that employees gain a valuable\n\nsubstantive right simply by turning 40 for the ADEA protects\n\nworkers who are at least 40 years of age from age discrimination.\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 631(a).   But the district court went on to reason\n\nthat all 40-year old employees had accrued ADEA \"claims\" that\n\nnecessarily rendered their bundle of accrued claims more valuable\n\nthan younger employees' bundles.   Thus, the district court's\n\nreasoning assumes that all terminated employees with races or\n\nwith genders have accrued potential Title VII claims against\n\ntheir former employers, and that terminated employees with sexual\n\norientations have such potential claims under various relevant\n\nstate laws.   The court's reasoning also assumes that all such\n\naccrued claims are equally valuable.   To take the principle where\n\nit logically leads, it is like saying every person has accrued a\n\npotential due process claim simply because he or she has been a\n\nperson and hence has been protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth\n\namendments.\n\n          This kind of reasoning is inappropriate because the\n\nADEA claim was just one of a plethora of claims that SmithKline\n\nasked employees to waive.   Thus, the value of the accrued ADEA\n\nclaim has to be weighed against the value of other accrued\n\nclaims.   For instance, other things being equal, a terminated\n\femployee's potential accrued gender discrimination claim probably\n\nwould be worth more if the employee were a woman, even though\n\nboth men and women are protected by Title VII.   Similarly,\n\nassuming all other variables to be equal, a black employee's race\n\ndiscrimination claim may be worth more in the abstract than such\n\na claim from a white employee.   Recognizing these possibilities\n\ninevitably leads us away from the abstract reasoning utilized by\n\nthe district court into a more practical approach that recognizes\n\nthat the value of a bundle of accrued claims depends on a myriad\n\nof factors including, among other things, the employee's work\n\nperformance history, the circumstances surrounding the\n\nterminations, and the nature -- if any -- of the rehiring.    For\n\nexample, a 35-year-old black employee terminated despite a\n\nstellar work performance record certainly has a more valuable\n\nclaim under Title VII than a 55-year-old, fired because of\n\nincompetence, has under the ADEA.   In theory, if there were a\n\nmarket for accrued claims, terminated 40-year old employees would\n\nnot receive automatically the highest bids, as buyers would want\n\nto know more facts about the circumstances surrounding individual\n\nterminations.   The point, of course, is that the district court's\n\nassumption, that because of the ADEA all 40-year old employees\n\nhave a more valuable set of claims than younger workers, is\n\nsimply wrong.   One cannot say in the first instance that the 50-\n\nyear-old's accrued \"claims\" are by definition worth more than\n\nothers' accrued claims.\n\f            The fallacy in the district court's reasoning is in\n\nlarge part due to the conflation of the notion of a \"right\" with\n\nthe notion of an accrued \"claim.\"    A right to be free\n\nprospectively from certain forms of discrimination always is\n\nworth something; however, whether a person has accrued a claim\n\nbased on a right depends entirely on what previously has\n\noccurred.    SmithKline did not ask its terminated employees to\n\ngive up their statutorily or constitutionally created rights to\n\nbe free prospectively of various forms of discrimination.\n\nRather, the plan's focus was entirely retrospective, on whether\n\nthe value of any claims -- by definition already accrued -- was\n\nworth surrendering for the enhanced benefits.    The significance\n\nof the distinction between a right and a claim is particularly\n\ndemonstrated in this case because the district court found that\n\nDiBiase's substantive age discrimination claim had no merit.\n\n            In fact, the district court's reasoning and conclusion\n\nare at odds with propositions of law it acknowledges in its\n\nopinion.    The court correctly noted that the ADEA \"focuses on\n\nindividuals, and precludes treatment of individuals as simply\n\ncomponents of an age-based class.\"   DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 347.\n\nBy analogy, in Manhart, the pension policy violated Title VII\n\ndespite the fact that it was based on legitimate actuarial\n\ncalculations, because \"the basic policy of the statute requires\n\nthat we focus on fairness to individuals rather than fairness to\n\nclasses.\"   Manhart, 435 U.S. at 709, 98 S.Ct. at 1376.    This is\n\fbecause \"[p]ractices that classify employees in terms of\n\nreligion, race, or sex [or age] tend to preserve traditional\n\nassumptions about groups rather than thoughtful scrutiny of\n\nindividuals.\"   Id.    Yet the district court's reasoning turns this\n\nprinciple on its head.    Here, SmithKline enacted a policy that\n\ncalled for each individual to weigh the circumstances surrounding\n\nhis or her discharge, and to make an informed decision about\n\nwhether to sign the release or proceed with claims that, if they\n\nexisted, already had accrued.    Thus, the policy certainly was\n\nfair to individuals.    Yet, the district court's opinion, by\n\nconflating prospective rights with accrued claims, ignored the\n\nvariances in each individual's situation, and instead classified\n\nall persons who were at least 40 years old as being in the\n\nidentical position.    The opinion thus reached a conclusion\n\ndirectly contrary to the policy it correctly enunciated.\n\n          We must emphasize that our result may have been\n\ndifferent had there been no analytical distinction between the\n\nclass of disadvantaged employees (assuming such a class) and the\n\nprotected class -- that is, had older employees by definition\n\ngiven up more claims than younger employees.    In this regard,\n\nHazen again is instructive.    Although the Court concluded that\n\n\"age and years of service are analytically distinct,\"    Hazen,\n\n____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1707, it expressly declined to\n\n\"consider the special case where an employee is about to vest in\n\npension benefits as a result of his age, rather than years of\n\fservice.\"   Hazen, ___ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1707.   The\n\ncorrelation between age and pension status in that special case\n\nis materially different -- the terminated employee always will be\n\na member of the protected class.   The point is important, because\n\nwe would have faced a different situation if, for example,\n\nSmithKline conditioned the expanded separation package upon a\n\nwaiver only of ADEA claims inasmuch as employees do in fact gain\n\na substantive right when they turn 40.    Thus, assuming no\n\nknowledge of the circumstances surrounding the termination, the\n\npossibility that a terminated older employee actually has a\n\nviable age discrimination claim, is worth something (though\n\nprobably not much) in the abstract.    It follows, then, that if\n\nSmithKline required terminated employees to give up only ADEA\n\nclaims to obtain the enhanced benefits, older employees but not\n\nyounger employees would be forced to give up something of\n\nvalue.11\n\n            In the foregoing scenario, SmithKline would have\n\ntreated older workers differently than younger workers.       Thus, in\n\nEEOC v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 869 F.2d 696 (3d Cir. 1989),\n\nvacated and remanded, 493 U.S. 801, 110 S.Ct. 37 (1989), we held\nthat a policy denying severance pay to laid-off employees who\n\nwere eligible for early or selected retirement constituted\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of age.    There, the class of people\n\neligible for early retirement always coincided with members of\n\n11\n .   But see footnote 9, supra.\n\fthe protected class.    Id. at 705.12   But that is not the\n\nsituation here and we decline to address how we would rule in\n\nsuch a case.    SmithKline conditioned the right to the expanded\n\nbenefits on an employee's blanket waiver of all accrued claims;\n\nthis treatment cannot be said to be disparate, because it is\n\nimpossible to tell whose package of potential claims is more\n\nvaluable.13    Therefore, in light of the above, DiBiase has no\n\ndisparate treatment claim against SmithKline.\n\n12\n . The Supreme Court remanded Westinghouse for reconsideration\nin light of Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,\n492 U.S. 158, 109 S.Ct. 1854 (1989). In Betts, the Supreme Court\nheld that the then-existing section 4(f)(2) of the ADEA --\nexempting from the ADEA's prohibitions \"any bona fide employee\nbenefit plan . . . which is not a subterfuge to evade the\npurposes of the Act\" -- insulates bona fide plans from the\npurview of the ADEA \"so long as the plan is not a method of\ndiscriminating in other, non-fringe-benefit aspects of the\nemployment relationship.\" Id. at 177, 109 S.Ct. at 2866.\nCongress since overruled Betts. We cite Westinghouse solely for\nthe proposition that when a company's policy distinguishes\nemployees on the basis of a factor analytically indistinct from\nage, we would be faced with a different situation than that in\nthis case.\n\n13\n . The National Employment Lawyers Association has filed an\namicus brief relying in part on EEOC v. Board of Governors, 957\nF.2d 424 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, ____ U.S. ____, 113 S.Ct. 299\n(1992). In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit held that \"a collective bargaining agreement provision\nthat denies employees their contractual right to a grievance\nproceeding whenever the employee initiates a claim, including a\nclaim of age-based discrimination, in an administrative or\njudicial forum\", id. at 425, violates section 4(d) of the ADEA.\nId. at 431. Section 4(d) prohibits employers from retaliating\nagainst an employee \"because such individual . . . has made a\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an\ninvestigation, proceeding or litigation under this chapter.\" 29\nU.S.C. ยง 623(d). The company's policy therefore commanded a\nviolation of this provision anytime an employee filed an age\n\f                          C.   Disparate Impact\n\n         1.   Whether DiBiase adequately has raised this issue\n\n              An amicus, the National Employment Lawyers Association\n\n(NELA), urges us to affirm the district court's judgment on the\n\nalternative theory of disparate impact.      In a disparate impact\n\ncase, the plaintiff claims that the employment practice \"has a\n\ndisproportionate effect on older workers [and thus] violates the\n\nADEA.\"    Hazen,       U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1710 (Kennedy, J.\n\nconcurring).     While the district court indicated that it \"need\n\nnot determine whether the policy also constitutes disparate\n\nimpact,\" DiBiase, 849 F. Supp. at 348 n.13, it nevertheless went\n\non to say:\n              Disparate impact cases typically focus on\n              statistical disparities between members of\n              the protected and unprotected classes. In\n              this case, however, no statistics are\n              necessary because all members of the age-\n              protected class must surrender potential age\n              discrimination claims, whereas no member of\n              the non-protected class has potential age\n              discrimination claims to surrender. Thus, a\n              disparate impact analysis in this case\n              involves arguments identical to those\n              involved in the disparate treatment inquiry,\n              and results in the same conclusion:\n              SmithKline's policy causes a disparate impact\n              because it specifies different treatment.\n\n\nId. (citation omitted; emphasis in original).      The district\n\ncourt's observation about disparate impact assumes that older\n(..continued)\ndiscrimination charge with the EEOC.      This decision does not\nsupport DiBiase's position.\n\fworkers signing the release gave up more than younger workers\n\nsolely because the ADEA protects only older workers.   In light of\n\nour discussion above, that analysis is flawed fundamentally.\n\nMoreover, the district court's reasoning is somewhat circular --\n\nin explaining why there is disparate impact liability, the court\n\nassumed the conclusion of its disparate treatment analysis.      That\n\nlogical flaw makes the disparate impact analysis redundant: To\n\nsay that there is disparate impact because there is disparate\n\ntreatment is to say nothing at all.   Of course, if a policy is\n\nfacially discriminatory, it has a disparate impact on the\n\ndiscriminated-against individuals.    Therefore, we reject the\n\ndistrict court's disparate impact conclusion for the reasons\n\ndetailed above.14\n\n          But the question remains -- should we still remand the\n\nmatter for further proceedings (and perhaps further discovery) on\n\na different type of disparate impact theory.   After all, to\n\nconduct a disparate impact analysis properly in this context, the\n\ncourt should have assumed that the release did not treat\n\nemployees disparately, and then asked whether, in reality, the\n14\n . The problem with the district court's analysis probably\nstems from the fact that the court explicitly indicated that it\nneed not reach the issue of disparate impact. See DiBiase, 849\nF. Supp. at 348 n.13; Br. Amicus Curiae of National Employment\nLawyers Association at 7 (acknowledging that district court\ndetermined that it need not decide whether the severance plan\nconstitutes unlawful disparate impact). The language following\nthe district court's disclaimer constituted simply a reflection\non the import of the court's disparate treatment conclusion --\nonce a policy is deemed facially discriminatory, the policy has a\ndisparate impact as well.\n\fpolicy had a disproportionate effect on older employees.     Such an\n\ninquiry, of course, would have required use of sophisticated\n\nstatistical data, and DiBiase apparently was not inclined to take\n\nthis path, as he produced no such evidence.\n\n            DiBiase does not urge us to reach this conclusion as\n\nan alternative way to uphold the district court's judgment if we\n\nreject the court's disparate treatment analysis.   Only the amicus\n\nargues that DiBiase's \"ADEA claims are actionable under a\n\ndisparate impact theory,\" NELA Br. at 7, but an \"amicus may not\n\nframe the issues for appeal.\"   Swan v. Peterson, 6 F.3d 1373,\n\n1383 (9th Cir. 1993) (citing Sanchez-Trujillo v. I.N.S., 801 F.2d\n\n1571, 1581 n.9 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, ____ U.S. ____,\n\n____ S.Ct. ____, 1004 U.S. LEXIS 7855 (1994).   Absent the\n\nexistence of \"substantial public interests\" calling us to depart\n\nfrom the general rule, \"we consider only issues argued in the\n\nbriefs filed by the parties and not those argued in the briefs\n\nfiled by interested nonparties.\"   Continental Ins. Cos. v.\n\nNortheastern Pharmaceutical & Chem. Co., Inc., 842 F.2d 977, 984\n\n(8th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 821, 109 S.Ct. 66 (1988);\n\nPreservation Coalition, Inc. v. Pierce, 667 F.2d 851, 862 (9th\nCir. 1982).15   Therefore, because DiBiase is not pursuing a\n\ndisparate impact claim, the issue is not before us.\n\n\n\n15\n . SmithKline addresses disparate impact theory, apparently to\nprotect itself lest we conclude that the district court\nadequately reached the issue.\n\f     2.   The availability of disparate impact theory in this case16\n\n              We note, however, that even if the issue properly were\n\nbefore us, disparate impact theory would not be applicable here.\n\nIn a factual scenario remarkably like the one here, the Supreme\n\nCourt held that there can be no disparate impact liability.      In\n\nManhart, the City of Los Angeles argued that its pension policy\nrequiring women to contribute greater amounts into a pension fund\n\nthan men was mandated by Title VII itself, reasoning that \"a\n\ngender-neutral pension plan would itself violate Title VII\n\nbecause of its disproportionately heavy impact on male\n\nemployees.\"      Manhart, 435 U.S. at 710 n.20, 98 S.Ct. 1370, 1376\n\nn.20.       The Court dismissed the argument out of hand: \"Even under\n\nTitle VII itself -- assuming disparate-impact analysis applies to\n\nfringe benefits -- the male employees would not prevail.      Even a\n\ncompletely neutral practice will inevitably have some\n\ndisproportionate impact on one group or another. . . .      [T]his\n\nCourt has never held . . . that discrimination must always be\n\ninferred from such consequences.\"      Id.   That case, like this one,\n\ninvolved an employer's grant of \"fringe benefits.\"      There, the\n\ncity argued that it was required to treat people unequally in\n\norder to treat them equally.      Here, DiBiase makes the identical\n\nargument -- that SmithKline was required to treat employees\n\n\n16\n . Judge Becker does not join subsection II(C)(2) and II(C)(3)\nof the opinion. He would say simply that DiBiase clearly abjured\nany intention to proceed under a disparate impact theory, and\ntherefore there is no disparate impact claim before us.\n\funequally in order to treat them equally.   Like in Manhart, the\n\ndisparate treatment is alleged to be justified because older\n\npeople as a group would otherwise pay more for the privilege than\n\nyounger people.\n\n           Moreover, the facts of this case simply do not\n\nimplicate the policies underlying disparate impact theory.    In\n\nthe first place, as described in detail above, the policy does\n\nnot per se affect older workers more harshly than younger\n\nworkers.   Second, there is absolutely no evidence that the\n\ncompany's policy does in fact affect older people adversely.\n\nThird, even if it did, such a neutral policy -- which does not\n\nrely on an invidious stereotype about older employees, which\n\nclearly is not motivated by a discriminatory impulse, and which\n\ncould be demonstrated to have a disparate impact only by the use\n\nof an incredibly sophisticated statistical analysis -- simply\n\ncannot be the basis of ADEA liability.   Fourth, this is not a\n\ncase where finding liability would help eradicate the entrenched\n\neffects of past discrimination.   Finally, use of statistical\n\nevidence demonstrating a disproportionate impact will shed little\n\nlight on the employer's motive.   In short, there can be no\n\nliability in this case based on disparate impact.\n\n\n           3.   Disparate impact theory under the ADEA17\n\n\n17\n . Judge McKee does not join subsection II(C)(3) of the\nopinion, as he finds it unnecessary to consider the question of\nwhether disparate impact theory liability is viable under the\n\f          Moreover, in the wake of Hazen, it is doubtful that\n\ntraditional disparate impact theory is a viable theory of\n\nliability under the ADEA.    In Hazen, the Supreme Court stated\n\nthat it was declining to decide whether an employer may be liable\n\nunder the ADEA on a disparate impact theory.    Id. at ____, 113\n\nS.Ct. at 1706, id. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1710 (Kennedy, J.\n\nconcurring); Markham v. Geller, 451 U.S. 945, 101 S.Ct. 2028\n\n(1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).\n\nYet the analysis in Hazen casts considerable doubt on the\n\nviability of the theory.    And, in fact, we recently recognized\n\nthat the existence of disparate impact theory under the ADEA is\n\nan open question.   See Armbruster, 32 F.3d at 772 n.4 (\"Whether a\n\ndisparate impact theory of liability is even available under ADEA\n\nhas yet to be addressed by the Supreme Court.    In any event,\n\nbecause the district court has not yet addressed this issue, we\n\nthink it would be inappropriate for us to consider it.\").\n\n(Citations omitted).18\n(..continued)\nADEA. Therefore, Judge Greenberg writes this subsection only for\nhimself.\n18\n . In Massarsky v. General Motors Corp., 706 F.2d 111 (3d\nCir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 937, 104 S.Ct. 348 (1983), we noted\nthat \"this court has never ruled on whether a plaintiff can\nestablish a violation of the Act by showing disparate impact\nalone.\" Id. at 120. In MacNamara v. Korean Air Lines, 863 F.2d\n1135 (3d Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 944, 110 S.Ct. 349\n(1989), however, we said that \"Title VII and ADEA liability can\nbe found where facially neutral employment practices have a\ndiscriminatory effect or 'disparate impact' on protected groups,\nwithout proof that the employer adopted these practices with a\ndiscriminatory motive.\" Id. at 1148. That case is not\ncontrolling, however. First, there the plaintiffs challenged\n\f           Three premises in the Hazen Court's analysis make the\n\npoint.   First, though not explicitly deciding the viability of\n\ndisparate impact liability under the ADEA, the Court did note\n\nthat disparate treatment \"captures the essence of what Congress\n\nsought to prohibit in the ADEA.\"   Hazen, ____ U.S. at ____, 113\n\nS.Ct. at 1706.   Second, the Court reasoned that \"Congress'\n\npromulgation of the ADEA was prompted by its concern that older\n\nworkers were being deprived of employment on the basis of\n\ninaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.\"    Id.   Finally, the\n\nCourt held that \"[w]hen the employer's decision is wholly\n\nmotivated by factors other than age, the problem of inaccurate\n\nand stigmatizing stereotypes disappears.    This is true even if\n\nthe motivating factor is correlated with age . . . .\"     Id.     In a\n\npure disparate impact case, the employer's decision by definition\n\nis \"wholly motivated by factors other than age.\"19    Thus, with\n\nthe third premise, the Supreme Court apparently concluded that in\n(..continued)\n\"the practice of favoring Korean nationals on the ground that it\nhas the effect of discriminating against others on grounds of\nrace or national origin.\" Id. Thus, the disparate impact\nallegation involved Title VII only, and the statement about the\nADEA is pure dicta. Second, the cases relied upon for the\nproposition were Title VII cases, and in light of our express\nstatement in Massarsky that Title VII jurisprudence did not\nnecessarily apply to the ADEA in this context, it is\ninconceivable that we simply would have applied disparate impact\ntheory without analysis -- particularly when the application was\nnot relevant to the decision. Third, we decided MacNamara\nbefore Hazen, and subsequent Supreme Court authority necessarily\ncontrols.\n19\n . I am not concerned here with situations in which impact is\nused to prove intent to discriminate.\n\fsuch cases, the policies behind the ADEA are not implicated.\n\nWith that said, it is difficult to see how disparate impact\n\nliability can survive the analysis.\n\n          The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and two\n\ndistrict courts, relying in part on Hazen, recently held that\n\ndisparate impact liability is unavailable under the ADEA.     EEOC\n\nv. Francis W. Parker School, 41 F.3d 1073, 1077 (7th Cir. 1994)\n\n(\"decisions based on criteria which merely tend to affect workers\n\nover the age of forty more adversely than workers under forty are\n\nnot prohibited\") (citing Anderson v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 13\n\nF.3d 1120 (7th Cir. 1993));   Martincic v. Urban Redevelopment\n\nAuthority of Pittsburgh, 844 F. Supp. 1073, 1076-77 (W.D. Pa.\n\n1994) (holding that in light of Hazen, there can be no disparate\n\nimpact liability under the ADEA), aff'd, No. 94-3235,       F.3d\n\n(3d Cir. Nov. 28, 1994) (table); Hiatt v. Union Pacific R.R. Co.,\n\n859 F. Supp. 1416, 1434 (D. Wyo. 1994) (\"[I]t is inappropriate to\n\nincorporate the disparate impact theory of discrimination\n\nenumerated [by the Supreme Court in the Title VII context] into\n\nthe ADEA.\").20\n20\n . Yet several courts of appeal have assumed that disparate\nimpact liability applies under the ADEA. See, e.g., Geller v.\nMarkham, 635 F.2d 1027, 1032 (2d Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 451\nU.S. 945, 101 S.Ct. 2028 (1981); Abbott v. Federal Forge, Inc.,\n912 F.2d 867, 872 (6th Cir. 1990); Rose v. Wells Fargo & Co., 902\nF.2d 1417, 1423-25 (9th Cir. 1990). These cases were decided\nbefore Hazen, and none of them even purported to conduct any\nanalysis of the issue. Rather, they probably relied on the oft-\ncited principle that interpretations of the ADEA parallel\ninterpretations of Title VII. Because Hazen, if nothing else at\nleast disposes of that assumption, those cases are not\npersuasive. However, even after Hazen, the Court of Appeals for\n\f          The Hazen Court's emphasis on the congressional purpose\n\nbehind the ADEA is particularly helpful in confirming the Court's\n\nintimations.   First, the statutory language does not explicitly\n\nprovide for disparate impact liability.   While it has been argued\n\nthat section 623(a)(2) authorizes claims of disparate impact, see\n\nMarla Ziegler, Disparate Impact Analysis and the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, 68 Minn. L. Rev. 1038, 1050-51\n\n(1984), that reading of the statute is inaccurate.   The section\n\nrenders it \"unlawful for an employer ---\n          (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n          employees in any way which would deprive or\n          tend to deprive any individual of employment\n          opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n          his status as an employee, because of such\n          individual's age . . . .\"\n\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a)(2).   However, finding the theory lurking in\n\nthis section requires reading the language \"because of such\n\nindividual's age\" to modify \"adversely affect\" rather than to\n\nmodify \"limit, segregate, or classify.\"   Because of the placement\n\nof the commas, this is a grammatically incorrect reading.     See\n\nPamela S. Krop, Note, Age Discrimination and the Disparate Impact\n\nDoctrine, 34 Stan. L. Rev. 837, 842-43 (1982).   Moreover, as Krop\n\npoints out, section (2) parallels the language of section (1),\n\nwhich makes it unlawful for an employer --\n          (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n          any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\n(..continued)\nthe Eighth Circuit assumed -- again without analysis -- that\ndisparate impact liability is cognizable under the ADEA. See\nHoughton v. Sipco, Inc., 38 F.3d 953, 958-59 (8th Cir. 1994).\n\f          against any individual with respect to his\n          compensation, terms, conditions, or\n          privileges of employment, because of such\n          individual's age.\n\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a).    \"Under this provision, the 'because of such\n\nindividual's age' clause can only modify the description of\n\nprohibited actions . . . . The parallel wording of section\n\n4(a)(2) indicates that it too was aimed at disparate treatment.\n\nAn employer may not limit, segregate, or classify employees on\n\nthe basis of age in a manner that would adversely affect an\n\nemployee.\"    Krop at 843.\n\n             More than that, however, although the ADEA language\n\nquoted above parallels the language in Title VII, when the\n\nSupreme Court found disparate impact liability under Title VII,\n\nit relied not on any specific statutory language but on the\n\npolicies behind the statute.    In that case, Griggs v. Duke Power\n\nCo., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849 (1971), the Court stated:\n          The objective of Congress in the enactment of\n          Title VII . . . was to achieve equality of\n          employment opportunities and remove barriers\n          that have operated in the past to favor an\n          identifiable group of white employees over\n          other employees. Under the Act, practices,\n          procedures, or tests neutral on their face,\n          and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot\n          be maintained if they operate to 'freeze' the\n          status quo of prior discriminatory employment\n          practices.\n\n\nId. at 429-30, 91 S.Ct. at 853.    This policy is not easily\n\ntransplanted into the ADEA, the primary purpose of which is to\n\nprohibit employers from acting upon the assumption that\n\f\"productivity and competence decline with old age.\"    Hazen, ____\n\nU.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1706.    As one court has put it, \"[i]n\n\nGriggs, the critical fact was the link between the history of\n\neducational discrimination and the use of that discrimination as\n\na means of presently disadvantaging African-Americans.    These\n\nconcerns simply are not present when the alleged disparate impact\n\nis based on age.\"   Hiatt, 859 F. Supp. at 1436.   Congress itself\n\nrecognized this distinction, for it provided in the ADEA that\n\n\"[i]t shall not be unlawful for an employer . . . to take any\n\naction otherwise prohibited [by this section] where the\n\ndifferentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age . .\n\n. .\"   29 U.S.C. ยง623(f)(1).   \"The sentence is incomprehensible\n\nunless the prohibition forbids disparate treatment and the\n\nexception authorized disparate impact.\"   Metz v. Transit Mix,\n\nInc., 828 F.2d 1202, 1220 (7th Cir. 1987) (Easterbrook, J.\n\ndissenting) (quoting Douglas Laycock, Continuing Violations,\n\nDisparate Impact in Compensation, and Other Title VII Issues, 49\n\nL. & Contemp. Prob. 53, 55 (Aut. 1986) (referring to identical\n\nlanguage of Equal Pay Act).    In other words, by the statutory\n\nlanguage itself, Congress recognized that neutral policies not\n\nmotivated by discriminatory intent may be permissible employment\n\npractices.   It is difficult to imagine how Congress could have\n\nconcluded otherwise -- for application of disparate impact theory\n\ncould lead to results which Congress probably did not intend.21\n\n21\n . For example, if an employer set the work week at five days\nper week, eight hours per day, or if it determined to eliminate\n\f          But I need not go so far as to say that disparate\n\nimpact theory is never available under the ADEA.    Rather,\n\nresolution of that issue must await another day.    I write this\n\nsection to highlight my doubts and to say that, at any rate,\n\ndisparate impact theory should not be applied as a matter of\n\ncourse.   Here, of course, we only need hold that even if in some\n\nsituations disparate impact liability may be established under\n\nthe ADEA, this case does not present one of them.\n\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          In view of the aforesaid, we hold that an employer may\n\noffer enhanced benefits to all terminated employees agreeing to\n\nwaive all claims against the company, without providing extra\n\nconsideration to workers protected by the ADEA.    Thus, it is\n\nevident that the district court should have denied DiBiase's\n\nmotion for summary judgment and should have granted SmithKline's\n\nmotion for summary judgment on count 2 of the amended complaint.\n\nFurthermore, it is clear that there is no need for further\n\nproceedings in the district court.   See Nazay v. Miller, 949 F.2d\n\n(..continued)\nmedical insurance coverage, its decisions could have a disparate\nimpact on older employees. In that circumstance, in an ADEA\naction employers would be forced to justify their business\npractices with older employees then having the opportunity to\ndemonstrate that alternative employment practices could fulfill\nthe employer's needs. See Abbott v. Federal Forge, Inc., 912\nF.2d 867, 872 (6th Cir. 1990). Such a regime could subject\nemployers to unreasonable intrusions by juries into their\nbusiness practices. See Gray v. York Newspapers, Inc., 957 F.2d\n1070, 1083 (3d Cir. 1992).\n\f1323, 1328 (3d Cir. 1991).   Consequently, the order of May 3,\n\n1994, granting DiBiase summary judgment will be reversed and the\n\nmatter will be remanded to the district court for entry of\n\njudgment in favor of SmithKline.\n\f",

We\n\nconclude that such a practice does not violate the ADEA, and\n\ntherefore we will reverse the judgment of the district court.\n\nBecause there is no basis for further proceedings in this case,\n\nwe will remand the matter to the district court with instructions\n\nto enter judgment for the defendant.\n\n\n  I.   INTRODUCTION, FACTUAL BACKGROUND, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\f            The germane facts are not disputed.1   In 1990, the\n\nemployer, defendant SmithKline Beecham Corporation (SmithKline),\n\na Philadelphia-based pharmaceutical company, consolidated four\n\ncomputer data centers it operated throughout Pennsylvania and in\n\nTennessee into a single center at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\n\nPrior to the consolidation, SmithKline employed plaintiff John\n\nDiBiase as a first-shift supervisor of computer operators at its\n\nPhiladelphia data center.    With the consolidation, he moved to\n\nKing of Prussia, where six supervisors remained employed, working\n\ntwo per shift, with each pair overseeing three to five computer\n\noperators.    Between late 1991 and early 1992, SmithKline decided\n\nto reduce the staff of this division, and it assessed the\n\nconcomitant consequences.    Specifically, the data center's\n\npersonnel manager \"prepared an 'adverse impact analysis'\n\nexamining the gender, race, and age of the shift supervisors to\n\ndetermine if any adverse impact would result from the planned\n\nreduction in staff.\"    DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 343.   On February\n\n1, 1992, SmithKline decided to lay off DiBiase and one other\n\nshift supervisor and it informed DiBiase of this decision the\n\nnext day.    At that time, he was 51 years old.\n\n            SmithKline offered employees terminated in a RIF a\n\nseparation benefit plan, which provided a lump sum payment based\n\non the employee's length of service, as well as continued health\n\n1\n . Unless otherwise noted, we take the facts from the district\ncourt opinion. DiBiase v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403082\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403082/dibiase-v-smithkline-beecham-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Specifically, the basic plan provided 12\n\nmonths salary and three months continued benefits.    Additionally,\n\nthe plan offered enhanced benefits to employees willing to sign a\n\ngeneral release of all claims against SmithKline.    Terminated\n\nemployees who signed the release were entitled to receive 15\n\nmonths salary and six months continued health and dental\n\ncoverage.   The release is in large part the subject of this\n\nappeal, and it stated in pertinent part:\n               In consideration of the monies and other\n          consideration to be received by me under the\n          SmithKline Beecham Separation Program, I\n          hereby irrevocably and unconditionally\n          release, waive and forever discharge\n          SmithKline Beecham Corporation, its\n          affiliates, parents, successors,\n          predecessors, subsidiaries, assigns,\n          directors, officers, employees,\n          representatives, agents, and attorneys . . .\n          from any and all claims, agreements, causes\n          of action, demands, or liabilities of any\n          nature whatsoever . . . arising, occurring or\n          existing at any time prior to the signing of\n          this General Release, whether known or\n          unknown.\n\n\nGeneral release ยง 1 at app. 98.   The release provided that\n\nemployees who sign it waive\n          [a]ny and all claims arising under federal,\n          state, or local constitutions, laws, rules or\n          regulations or common law prohibiting\n          employment discrimination based upon age,\n          race, color, sex, religion, handicap or\n          disability, national origin or any other\n          protected category or characteristic,\n          including but not limited to any and all\n          claims arising under the Age Discrimination\n          in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, the\n          Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights\n          Acts of 1866 or 1871, the National Labor\n\f            Relations Act and/or under any other federal,\n            state or local human rights, civil rights, or\n            employment discrimination statute, rule or\n            regulation.\n\n\nRelease ยง 1 ยถ2 at app. 98.    Prefatory language to the release\n\ncautioned employees that \"YOU SHOULD THOROUGHLY REVIEW AND\n\nUNDERSTAND THE TERMS, CONDITIONS AND EFFECT OF THE SEPARATION\n\nPROGRAM AND OF THIS GENERAL RELEASE.      THEREFORE, PLEASE CONSIDER\n\nIT FOR AT LEAST TWENTY-ONE (21) DAYS BEFORE SIGNING IT.      YOU ARE\n\nADVISED TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE YOU SIGN THIS GENERAL\n\nRELEASE.\"    Release at app. 98.   Under the terms of the release,\n\nemployees were given seven calendar days after signing to revoke\n\ntheir signature.    Release at app. 99.\n\n            DiBiase declined to sign the release.   Instead, on\n\nApril 29, 1992, he wrote a letter to William Mossett,\n\nSmithKline's personnel director, contending that SmithKline's\n\npolicy violated the ADEA. The letter reads in pertinent part:\n               So there can be no possible\n          misunderstanding I am stating my position as\n          follows.\n\n                               * * *\n                 As stated in my grievance I have reason\n            to believe that the company violated federal\n            and state age discrimination laws in\n            terminating me. I am declining the enhanced\n            separation benefit package because I do not\n            wish to give up my rights under these\n            discrimination laws. I believe that the\n            company's policy of requiring persons over\n            forty to release age discrimination claims\n            against the company in order to secure\n            enhanced separation benefits violates these\n            age discrimination laws since persons under\n            forty may elect to receive enhanced\n            separation benefits determined by the same\n\f            formula that applies to persons over forty\n            without releasing potential age\n            discrimination claims.\n\n\nLetter from DiBiase to Mossett of April 29, 1992, at app. 106,\n\n107.    Because DiBiase did not sign the release, SmithKline\n\nrefused to give him the enhanced benefits.    See Letter from\nTyrone Barber, SmithKline's Personnel Manager, to DiBiase of May\n\n4, 1992, at app. 108.    Still, DiBiase received the benefits due\n\nhim under SmithKline's basic plan. Id.\n\n            On July 2, 1992, DiBiase filed an affidavit and charge\n\nwith the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging\n\nboth that SmithKline terminated his employment because of his\n\nage, and that SmithKline's separation plan violated the ADEA\n\nbecause it treated older workers differently than younger workers\n\nby requiring them to release ADEA claims.    DiBiase EEOC aff. at\n\napp. 109-110.    On March 31, 1993, the EEOC determined that \"there\n\nis not reasonable cause to believe that there has been a\n\nviolation of the statute under which the charge has been filed.\"\n\nEEOC Determination at app. 67-68.\n\n            On June 14, 1993, DiBiase filed a complaint against\n\nSmithKline in the United States District Court for the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania.    His amended complaint contained two\n\ncounts.    Count 1 asserted that SmithKline fired him because of\n\nhis age, in violation of the ADEA.    Complaint ยถ 15-19 at app. 55-\n\n56.    Count 2 alleged that SmithKline's \"separation benefit plan\n\nviolates ADEA because it discriminates against [him] and its\n\fother employees forty or older by having higher requirements for\n\nthem to qualify for the additional separation benefits than apply\n\nto its employees under forty.\"    Complaint ยถ 29 at app. 58.\n\nDiBiase also asserted that SmithKline's actions underlying both\n\ncounts were willful and that he was entitled to punitive and\n\ndouble damages.   Complaint ยถยถ   19, 31 at app. 56, 59.   On August\n\n2, 1993, SmithKline moved to dismiss count 2 of the amended\n\ncomplaint, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).    In a Memorandum\n\nopinion and order filed on September 29, 1993, the district court\n\ndenied the motion.   The district court suggested that DiBiase\n\nmight be able to show that even if SmithKline's plan was a\n\n\"facially neutral employment\" policy, it \"had a significantly\n\ndiscriminatory impact.\"   Memorandum Op. at app. 47.\n\n           On December 20, 1993, SmithKline moved for summary\n\njudgment on both counts of DiBiase's complaint.    In an opinion\n\nand order dated March 15, 1994 -- entered the next day and\n\nreported at </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403082\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403082/dibiase-v-smithkline-beecham-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Pa. 1994) -- the district\n\ncourt granted the motion as to Count 1 and denied it as to Count\n\n2.   Specifically, the district court found that \"no jury\n\nreasonably could conclude from the facts\" that DiBiase had been\n\nreplaced in his job.   847 F. Supp. at 346.   Inasmuch as DiBiase\n\nhad not been replaced, the court concluded that he had failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of wrongful termination under the\n\fADEA.   Thus, the district court granted summary judgment to\n\nSmithKline on the termination count, count 1.2\n\n           However, the district court denied SmithKline's motion\n\nfor summary judgment on count 2.     Specifically, the court found\n\nthat the separation plan involved discriminatory treatment of\n\nolder persons.    Relying on the ADEA section providing a cause of\n\naction only for persons at least 40 years old, see 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n631(a), the district court observed that \"[i]n order for an older\n\nemployee to receive the same enhanced benefit as a younger\n\nemployee, the older employee must release her right to file an\n\nADEA claim.\"     DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 347.   The court further\n\nobserved that \"[t]his treatment is patently different because the\n\nyounger employee cannot have an ADEA claim.\"      Id.   From these\n\nobservations, the district court concluded that \"SmithKline's\n\npolicy facially discriminates\" against employees protected by the\n\nADEA.   Id. at 348.   Thus, the court denied SmithKline's motion.\n\n\n2\n . Ordinarily, when employment is terminated as part of a RIF,\nthe plaintiff need not prove that he or she was replaced by a\nworker outside the protected class. Rather, to demonstrate a\nprima facie case \"[i]n RIF cases, the plaintiff must show he was\nin the protected class, he was qualified, he was laid off and\nother unprotected workers were retained.\" Armbruster v. Unisys\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"676502\"><a href=\"/opinion/676502/65-fair-emplpraccas-bna-828-65-empl-prac-dec-p-43247-john-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">768</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 777 (3d Cir. 1994). Here, the district court\nfound that \"[p]laintiff cannot make such a showing, however,\nbecause all three retained employees . . . were within the\nprotected class when plaintiff was terminated.\" DiBiase, 847 F.\nSupp. at 345 n.5.

On December 22,\n\n1993, the district court consolidated the two actions.         The\n\nparties settled the retaliation claim, and on April 29, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court signed a stipulation and order (entered on May 2,\n\n1994) dismissing that claim with prejudice.    Thus, the May 3,\n\n1994 order granting DiBiase's motion for summary judgment on\n\ncount 2 concluded the proceedings before the district court.\n\nSmithKline timely filed a notice of appeal.

L. No.\n\n101-43, 104 Stat. 978 (1990) (OWBPA), explicitly considered and\n\nrejected a provision entitling older workers to extra\n\nconsideration for release of ADEA claims.7   The OWBPA set forth,\n\n6\n . As noted above, however, the statute provides that \"[t]he\nprohibitions in this chapter shall be limited to individuals who\nare at least 40 years of age.\" 29 U.S.C. ยง 631(a).\n7\n . Somewhat inexplicably, at oral argument DiBiase vigorously\ndenied that his theory of the case required employers to provide\nextra consideration to older workers signing general releases.\nTo the contrary, he said that a provision for extra consideration\nwould violate the ADEA as well and that the only way in which\nolder people would be treated the same as younger people would be\nto allow older people to sign a release agreeing to waive all\nclaims except those under the ADEA.\n\famong other things, specific standards governing whether an\n\nemployee's waiver of ADEA claims is valid.   See 29 U.S.C. ยง\n\n626(f).   SmithKline points out that early drafts of the OWBPA\n\nprovided that a waiver of ADEA claims is valid only when:\n          the rights or claims are waived in exchange\n          for consideration in addition to anything of\n          value --\n\n               (ii) that has been offered to a group or\n               class of individuals under an early\n               retirement incentive or other employment\n               termination program.\n\n\nSee 135 Cong. Rec. ยง 289-01, ยง 356-57 (introduction of bill in\nSenate); 135 Cong. Rec. H 696-03, H 697 (introduction of bill in\n\nHouse of Representatives).   SmithKline is correct in noting that\n(..continued)\n          However, this case has proceeded on the assumption that\nDiBiase was claiming extra consideration. In ruling on\nSmithKline's motion to dismiss, the district court stated that\nDiBiase \"argues that an employer could secure a release of ADEA\nclaims by offering additional consideration beyond that offered\nfor a release of all claims except ADEA claims.\" Memorandum of\nSeptember 27, 1993, at app. 47. Similarly, the district court\ncommented in its opinion that \"I have difficulty believing that\nthe widespread industry practice of offering enhanced benefits in\nexchange for a release of potential claims is so fragile that a\ndecision requiring additional consideration for a valid release\nof ADEA claims will cause the practice to expire.\" DiBiase, 847\nF. Supp. at 351. In short, the district court certainly believed\nthat DiBiase was asking for extra consideration.\n\n          At any rate, unless DiBiase is arguing that an employer\nnever could secure a valid general release from a terminated\nemployee protected by the ADEA, we perceive no analytical\ndistinction between a claim for extra consideration and a claim\nthat DiBiase should have been allowed to waive all claims except\nADEA claims in exchange for the enhanced benefits. Both\narguments seek special treatment. In the former situation, the\nolder worker receives extra money. In the latter situation, the\nolder employee preserves his or her ADEA claims.\n\fCongress did not include the provision in the OWBPA.     This\n\nhistory supporting SmithKline's position is significant and is\n\nentitled to some weight.    See United States v. Alcan Aluminum\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583601\"><a href=\"/opinion/583601/united-states-v-alcan-aluminum-corp-basf-corp-beazer-materials-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264-65 (3d Cir. 1992).    However, we do not\n\nrely primarily on legislative history in resolving this case\n\nbecause, as the following discussion shows, it is evident that\n\neven if we disregard the history we must conclude that\n\nSmithKline's policy did not violate the substantive provisions of\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n            With this said, we now assess whether SmithKline's\n\npolicy of providing enhanced benefits only to terminated\n\nemployees signing the release violated the ADEA.     A policy can be\n\ndiscriminatory because of its treatment of or impact on\n\nemployees.

Thus, when the policy itself displays the unlawful\n\ncategorization, the employee is relieved from independently\n\nproving intent.   See Hazen, ____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1705\n\n(while \"'proof of discriminatory motive is critical, . . . it can\n\nin some situations be inferred from the mere fact of differences\n\nin treatment. . . .'\") (citation omitted).\n\n            The district court based its conclusion that the policy\n\nconstitutes facial discrimination on the following reasoning.\n\nThe ADEA provides a cause of action only to persons age 40 or\n\nolder.   By its terms, then, the ADEA differentiates employees on\n\nthe basis of age, and leaves younger workers unprotected by the\n\nstatute.8   Thus, on their 40th birthday, workers gain a\n\nsubstantive, valuable right.    By contrast, nearly all other\n\njudicially enforceable rights apply to all persons, not to\n\n\n8\n . As one court has noted, \"[t]he House Report for [the ADEA]\ncited the example of airline stewardesses, who must apparently\n'retire' by the age of 32, as people beset by an obvious age\ndiscrimination problem, yet who will have no remedy under the\n[ADEA].\" Kodish v.

For example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\nprotects not just black workers, but whites as well.    Males as\n\nwell as females may bring successful gender-discrimination suits.\n\nAnd, in states with statutes prohibiting discrimination on the\n\nbasis of sexual orientation, presumably heterosexuals are\n\nprotected as well as homosexuals.    The district court next\n\nreasoned that, because the ADEA does not protect younger workers,\n\nwhile these other rights apply to all, older workers by\n\ndefinition hold a total number of rights greater than the total\n\nnumber of rights younger workers hold.   Hence, if younger workers\n\nhold rights with the total value of x, older workers have x + 1\n\nrights.   In light of this analysis, the court reasoned that older\n\nterminated workers have more accrued claims to give up than\n\nyounger workers.    Thus, in order to comply with the ADEA,\n\nSmithKline should have given extra consideration to older workers\n\nbecause by signing the release they were giving up more claims\n\nthan younger workers.    Accordingly, the court concluded that, by\n\ntreating older workers the same as younger workers, SmithKline\n\nfacially and explicitly discriminated on the basis of age.\n\n            We reject the district court's reasoning and thus we\n\nhold that it erred in concluding that SmithKline's policy is\n\nfacially discriminatory and therefore constitutes per se\ndiscrimination.    The touchstone of explicit facial discrimination\n\nis that the discrimination is apparent from the terms of the\n\fpolicy itself.   In Thurston, for example, an airline company's\n\npolicy constituted facial discrimination independent of proof of\n\nintent because it allowed all disqualified pilots automatically\n\nto be transferred to the position of flight engineer except those\n\ndisqualified on the basis of age.    Thurston, 469 U.S. at 121, 105\n\nS.Ct. at 622.    In Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 197, 111 S.Ct. at\n\n1202, the policy at issue violated Title VII because it\n\n\"exclude[d] women with childbearing capacity from lead-exposed\n\njobs and so create[d] a facial classification based on gender.\"\n\nSimilarly, Los Angeles Dep't of Water & Power v.

Its plan cannot be said to be\n\ndiscriminatory on its face, because the district court's\n\nconclusion that the plan is facially discriminatory required\n\nreferencing a fact outside the policy -- namely the ADEA.\n\nConsider the district court's holding:   \"Because ADEA provides a\n\ncause of action for age discrimination only to persons age forty\n\nand above, the Plan explicitly treats older employees differently\n\nthan younger employees.\"   DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 347.     But the\n\nword \"explicitly\" does not belong.   It is impossible to examine\n\nSmithKline's policy and conclude that on its face it treats older\n\fworkers disparately.   There is a good reason for this -- the\n\npolicy does not classify persons on the basis of age.   On the\n\ncontrary, the plan offering is an archetypical example of a\n\nfacially non-discriminatory policy.

The Supreme Court plainly has stated that \"there is no\n\ndisparate treatment under the ADEA when the factor motivating the\n\nemployer is some feature other than the employee's age.\"    Hazen,\n\n____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1705.   Here, the record does not\n\ncontain even the slightest evidence of discriminatory motive.10\n\n          At any rate, even assuming the existence of a\n\n(..continued)\nclaims are worth more than younger persons' claims.   See\ngenerally Typescript at 21-24.\n10\n . In Hazen, the Supreme Court held that discrimination based\non pension eligibility (when pension eligibility was based on\nyears of service) does not violate the ADEA despite the strong\ncorrelation between the two categories. The Court did say,\nhowever, that \"[w]e do not preclude the possibility that an\nemployer who targets employees with a particular pension status\non the assumption that these employees are likely to be older\nthereby engages in age discrimination. Pension status may be a\nproxy for age . . . in the sense that the employer may suppose a\ncorrelation between the two factors and act accordingly.\" Hazen,\n___ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1707. Here, there is nothing in\nthe record to indicate that SmithKline, by offering the general\nrelease, intended to target older workers. In fact, its motive\nis quite obvious -- it wanted to protect itself against all\nlitigation arising out of the RIF.\n\n          DiBiase also contends that the intent to discriminate\ncan be inferred based on his letter to SmithKline charging\nSmithKline with violating the ADEA. This is preposterous. The\nlogical consequence of the argument is that a terminated employee\ncan manufacture an illicit intent on the part of the employer\nsimply by telling the employer that he or she thinks the employer\nis violating an anti-discrimination law.\n\flegitimate factual dispute concerning SmithKline's motive, it\n\nsimply did not discriminate against DiBiase on the basis of age.\n\nAgain, we begin with the district court's reasoning.   The\n\ndistrict court properly concluded that employees gain a valuable\n\nsubstantive right simply by turning 40 for the ADEA protects\n\nworkers who are at least 40 years of age from age discrimination.\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 631(a).   But the district court went on to reason\n\nthat all 40-year old employees had accrued ADEA \"claims\" that\n\nnecessarily rendered their bundle of accrued claims more valuable\n\nthan younger employees' bundles.   Thus, the district court's\n\nreasoning assumes that all terminated employees with races or\n\nwith genders have accrued potential Title VII claims against\n\ntheir former employers, and that terminated employees with sexual\n\norientations have such potential claims under various relevant\n\nstate laws.   The court's reasoning also assumes that all such\n\naccrued claims are equally valuable.   To take the principle where\n\nit logically leads, it is like saying every person has accrued a\n\npotential due process claim simply because he or she has been a\n\nperson and hence has been protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth\n\namendments.\n\n          This kind of reasoning is inappropriate because the\n\nADEA claim was just one of a plethora of claims that SmithKline\n\nasked employees to waive.   Thus, the value of the accrued ADEA\n\nclaim has to be weighed against the value of other accrued\n\nclaims.   For instance, other things being equal, a terminated\n\femployee's potential accrued gender discrimination claim probably\n\nwould be worth more if the employee were a woman, even though\n\nboth men and women are protected by Title VII.   Similarly,\n\nassuming all other variables to be equal, a black employee's race\n\ndiscrimination claim may be worth more in the abstract than such\n\na claim from a white employee.   Recognizing these possibilities\n\ninevitably leads us away from the abstract reasoning utilized by\n\nthe district court into a more practical approach that recognizes\n\nthat the value of a bundle of accrued claims depends on a myriad\n\nof factors including, among other things, the employee's work\n\nperformance history, the circumstances surrounding the\n\nterminations, and the nature -- if any -- of the rehiring.    For\n\nexample, a 35-year-old black employee terminated despite a\n\nstellar work performance record certainly has a more valuable\n\nclaim under Title VII than a 55-year-old, fired because of\n\nincompetence, has under the ADEA.   In theory, if there were a\n\nmarket for accrued claims, terminated 40-year old employees would\n\nnot receive automatically the highest bids, as buyers would want\n\nto know more facts about the circumstances surrounding individual\n\nterminations.   The point, of course, is that the district court's\n\nassumption, that because of the ADEA all 40-year old employees\n\nhave a more valuable set of claims than younger workers, is\n\nsimply wrong.   One cannot say in the first instance that the 50-\n\nyear-old's accrued \"claims\" are by definition worth more than\n\nothers' accrued claims.\n\f            The fallacy in the district court's reasoning is in\n\nlarge part due to the conflation of the notion of a \"right\" with\n\nthe notion of an accrued \"claim.\"    A right to be free\n\nprospectively from certain forms of discrimination always is\n\nworth something; however, whether a person has accrued a claim\n\nbased on a right depends entirely on what previously has\n\noccurred.    SmithKline did not ask its terminated employees to\n\ngive up their statutorily or constitutionally created rights to\n\nbe free prospectively of various forms of discrimination.\n\nRather, the plan's focus was entirely retrospective, on whether\n\nthe value of any claims -- by definition already accrued -- was\n\nworth surrendering for the enhanced benefits.    The significance\n\nof the distinction between a right and a claim is particularly\n\ndemonstrated in this case because the district court found that\n\nDiBiase's substantive age discrimination claim had no merit.\n\n            In fact, the district court's reasoning and conclusion\n\nare at odds with propositions of law it acknowledges in its\n\nopinion.    The court correctly noted that the ADEA \"focuses on\n\nindividuals, and precludes treatment of individuals as simply\n\ncomponents of an age-based class.\"   DiBiase, 847 F. Supp. at 347.\n\nBy analogy, in Manhart, the pension policy violated Title VII\n\ndespite the fact that it was based on legitimate actuarial\n\ncalculations, because \"the basic policy of the statute requires\n\nthat we focus on fairness to individuals rather than fairness to\n\nclasses.\"   Manhart, 435 U.S. at 709, 98 S.Ct. at 1376.    This is\n\fbecause \"[p]ractices that classify employees in terms of\n\nreligion, race, or sex [or age] tend to preserve traditional\n\nassumptions about groups rather than thoughtful scrutiny of\n\nindividuals.\"   Id.    Yet the district court's reasoning turns this\n\nprinciple on its head.    Here, SmithKline enacted a policy that\n\ncalled for each individual to weigh the circumstances surrounding\n\nhis or her discharge, and to make an informed decision about\n\nwhether to sign the release or proceed with claims that, if they\n\nexisted, already had accrued.    Thus, the policy certainly was\n\nfair to individuals.    Yet, the district court's opinion, by\n\nconflating prospective rights with accrued claims, ignored the\n\nvariances in each individual's situation, and instead classified\n\nall persons who were at least 40 years old as being in the\n\nidentical position.    The opinion thus reached a conclusion\n\ndirectly contrary to the policy it correctly enunciated.\n\n          We must emphasize that our result may have been\n\ndifferent had there been no analytical distinction between the\n\nclass of disadvantaged employees (assuming such a class) and the\n\nprotected class -- that is, had older employees by definition\n\ngiven up more claims than younger employees.    In this regard,\n\nHazen again is instructive.    Although the Court concluded that\n\n\"age and years of service are analytically distinct,\"    Hazen,\n\n____ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1707, it expressly declined to\n\n\"consider the special case where an employee is about to vest in\n\npension benefits as a result of his age, rather than years of\n\fservice.\"   Hazen, ___ U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1707.   The\n\ncorrelation between age and pension status in that special case\n\nis materially different -- the terminated employee always will be\n\na member of the protected class.   The point is important, because\n\nwe would have faced a different situation if, for example,\n\nSmithKline conditioned the expanded separation package upon a\n\nwaiver only of ADEA claims inasmuch as employees do in fact gain\n\na substantive right when they turn 40.    Thus, assuming no\n\nknowledge of the circumstances surrounding the termination, the\n\npossibility that a terminated older employee actually has a\n\nviable age discrimination claim, is worth something (though\n\nprobably not much) in the abstract.    It follows, then, that if\n\nSmithKline required terminated employees to give up only ADEA\n\nclaims to obtain the enhanced benefits, older employees but not\n\nyounger employees would be forced to give up something of\n\nvalue.11\n\n            In the foregoing scenario, SmithKline would have\n\ntreated older workers differently than younger workers.

Id. at 705.12   But that is not the\n\nsituation here and we decline to address how we would rule in\n\nsuch a case.

The Supreme Court remanded Westinghouse for reconsideration\nin light of Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112321\"><a href=\"/opinion/112321/public-employees-retirement-system-of-ohio-v-betts/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Betts, the Supreme Court\nheld that the then-existing section 4(f)(2) of the ADEA --\nexempting from the ADEA's prohibitions \"any bona fide employee\nbenefit plan . . . which is not a subterfuge to evade the\npurposes of the Act\" -- insulates bona fide plans from the\npurview of the ADEA \"so long as the plan is not a method of\ndiscriminating in other, non-fringe-benefit aspects of the\nemployment relationship.\" Id. at 177, 109 S.Ct. at 2866.\nCongress since overruled Betts. We cite Westinghouse solely for\nthe proposition that when a company's policy distinguishes\nemployees on the basis of a factor analytically indistinct from\nage, we would be faced with a different situation than that in\nthis case.\n\n13\n . The National Employment Lawyers Association has filed an\namicus brief relying in part on EEOC v.

In that case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh\nCircuit held that \"a collective bargaining agreement provision\nthat denies employees their contractual right to a grievance\nproceeding whenever the employee initiates a claim, including a\nclaim of age-based discrimination, in an administrative or\njudicial forum\", id. at 425, violates section 4(d) of the ADEA.\nId. at 431. Section 4(d) prohibits employers from retaliating\nagainst an employee \"because such individual . . . has made a\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an\ninvestigation, proceeding or litigation under this chapter.\" 29\nU.S.C. ยง 623(d). The company's policy therefore commanded a\nviolation of this provision anytime an employee filed an age\n\f                          C.   Disparate Impact\n\n         1.   Whether DiBiase adequately has raised this issue\n\n              An amicus, the National Employment Lawyers Association\n\n(NELA), urges us to affirm the district court's judgment on the\n\nalternative theory of disparate impact.      In a disparate impact\n\ncase, the plaintiff claims that the employment practice \"has a\n\ndisproportionate effect on older workers [and thus] violates the\n\nADEA.\"    Hazen,       U.S. at ____, 113 S.Ct. at 1710 (Kennedy, J.\n\nconcurring).     While the district court indicated that it \"need\n\nnot determine whether the policy also constitutes disparate\n\nimpact,\" DiBiase, 849 F. Supp. at 348 n.13, it nevertheless went\n\non to say:\n              Disparate impact cases typically focus on\n              statistical disparities between members of\n              the protected and unprotected classes. In\n              this case, however, no statistics are\n              necessary because all members of the age-\n              protected class must surrender potential age\n              discrimination claims, whereas no member of\n              the non-protected class has potential age\n              discrimination claims to surrender. Thus, a\n              disparate impact analysis in this case\n              involves arguments identical to those\n              involved in the disparate treatment inquiry,\n              and results in the same conclusion:\n              SmithKline's policy causes a disparate impact\n              because it specifies different treatment.\n\n\nId. (citation omitted; emphasis in original).      The district\n\ncourt's observation about disparate impact assumes that older\n(..continued)\ndiscrimination charge with the EEOC.      This decision does not\nsupport DiBiase's position.\n\fworkers signing the release gave up more than younger workers\n\nsolely because the ADEA protects only older workers.   In light of\n\nour discussion above, that analysis is flawed fundamentally.\n\nMoreover, the district court's reasoning is somewhat circular --\n\nin explaining why there is disparate impact liability, the court\n\nassumed the conclusion of its disparate treatment analysis.      That\n\nlogical flaw makes the disparate impact analysis redundant: To\n\nsay that there is disparate impact because there is disparate\n\ntreatment is to say nothing at all.   Of course, if a policy is\n\nfacially discriminatory, it has a disparate impact on the\n\ndiscriminated-against individuals.    Therefore, we reject the\n\ndistrict court's disparate impact conclusion for the reasons\n\ndetailed above.14\n\n          But the question remains -- should we still remand the\n\nmatter for further proceedings (and perhaps further discovery) on\n\na different type of disparate impact theory.   After all, to\n\nconduct a disparate impact analysis properly in this context, the\n\ncourt should have assumed that the release did not treat\n\nemployees disparately, and then asked whether, in reality, the\n14\n . The problem with the district court's analysis probably\nstems from the fact that the court explicitly indicated that it\nneed not reach the issue of disparate impact. See DiBiase, 849\nF. Supp. at 348 n.13; Br. Amicus Curiae of National Employment\nLawyers Association at 7 (acknowledging that district court\ndetermined that it need not decide whether the severance plan\nconstitutes unlawful disparate impact). The language following\nthe district court's disclaimer constituted simply a reflection\non the import of the court's disparate treatment conclusion --\nonce a policy is deemed facially discriminatory, the policy has a\ndisparate impact as well.\n\fpolicy had a disproportionate effect on older employees.     Such an\n\ninquiry, of course, would have required use of sophisticated\n\nstatistical data, and DiBiase apparently was not inclined to take\n\nthis path, as he produced no such evidence.\n\n            DiBiase does not urge us to reach this conclusion as\n\nan alternative way to uphold the district court's judgment if we\n\nreject the court's disparate treatment analysis.   Only the amicus\n\nargues that DiBiase's \"ADEA claims are actionable under a\n\ndisparate impact theory,\" NELA Br. at 7, but an \"amicus may not\n\nframe the issues for appeal.\"   Swan v.

Like in Manhart, the\n\ndisparate treatment is alleged to be justified because older\n\npeople as a group would otherwise pay more for the privilege than\n\nyounger people.\n\n           Moreover, the facts of this case simply do not\n\nimplicate the policies underlying disparate impact theory.    In\n\nthe first place, as described in detail above, the policy does\n\nnot per se affect older workers more harshly than younger\n\nworkers.   Second, there is absolutely no evidence that the\n\ncompany's policy does in fact affect older people adversely.\n\nThird, even if it did, such a neutral policy -- which does not\n\nrely on an invidious stereotype about older employees, which\n\nclearly is not motivated by a discriminatory impulse, and which\n\ncould be demonstrated to have a disparate impact only by the use\n\nof an incredibly sophisticated statistical analysis -- simply\n\ncannot be the basis of ADEA liability.   Fourth, this is not a\n\ncase where finding liability would help eradicate the entrenched\n\neffects of past discrimination.   Finally, use of statistical\n\nevidence demonstrating a disproportionate impact will shed little\n\nlight on the employer's motive.   In short, there can be no\n\nliability in this case based on disparate impact.\n\n\n           3.   Disparate impact theory under the ADEA17\n\n\n17\n . Judge McKee does not join subsection II(C)(3) of the\nopinion, as he finds it unnecessary to consider the question of\nwhether disparate impact theory liability is viable under the\n\f          Moreover, in the wake of Hazen, it is doubtful that\n\ntraditional disparate impact theory is a viable theory of\n\nliability under the ADEA.

That case is not\ncontrolling, however. First, there the plaintiffs challenged\n\f           Three premises in the Hazen Court's analysis make the\n\npoint.   First, though not explicitly deciding the viability of\n\ndisparate impact liability under the ADEA, the Court did note\n\nthat disparate treatment \"captures the essence of what Congress\n\nsought to prohibit in the ADEA.\"   Hazen, ____ U.S. at ____, 113\n\nS.Ct. at 1706.   Second, the Court reasoned that \"Congress'\n\npromulgation of the ADEA was prompted by its concern that older\n\nworkers were being deprived of employment on the basis of\n\ninaccurate and stigmatizing stereotypes.\"    Id.   Finally, the\n\nCourt held that \"[w]hen the employer's decision is wholly\n\nmotivated by factors other than age, the problem of inaccurate\n\nand stigmatizing stereotypes disappears.    This is true even if\n\nthe motivating factor is correlated with age . . . .\"     Id.     In a\n\npure disparate impact case, the employer's decision by definition\n\nis \"wholly motivated by factors other than age.\"19    Thus, with\n\nthe third premise, the Supreme Court apparently concluded that in\n(..continued)\n\"the practice of favoring Korean nationals on the ground that it\nhas the effect of discriminating against others on grounds of\nrace or national origin.\" Id. Thus, the disparate impact\nallegation involved Title VII only, and the statement about the\nADEA is pure dicta. Second, the cases relied upon for the\nproposition were Title VII cases, and in light of our express\nstatement in Massarsky that Title VII jurisprudence did not\nnecessarily apply to the ADEA in this context, it is\ninconceivable that we simply would have applied disparate impact\ntheory without analysis -- particularly when the application was\nnot relevant to the decision. Third, we decided MacNamara\nbefore Hazen, and subsequent Supreme Court authority necessarily\ncontrols.\n19\n . I am not concerned here with situations in which impact is\nused to prove intent to discriminate.\n\fsuch cases, the policies behind the ADEA are not implicated.\n\nWith that said, it is difficult to see how disparate impact\n\nliability can survive the analysis.\n\n          The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and two\n\ndistrict courts, relying in part on Hazen, recently held that\n\ndisparate impact liability is unavailable under the ADEA.

These cases were decided\nbefore Hazen, and none of them even purported to conduct any\nanalysis of the issue. Rather, they probably relied on the oft-\ncited principle that interpretations of the ADEA parallel\ninterpretations of Title VII. Because Hazen, if nothing else at\nleast disposes of that assumption, those cases are not\npersuasive. However, even after Hazen, the Court of Appeals for\n\f          The Hazen Court's emphasis on the congressional purpose\n\nbehind the ADEA is particularly helpful in confirming the Court's\n\nintimations.   First, the statutory language does not explicitly\n\nprovide for disparate impact liability.   While it has been argued\n\nthat section 623(a)(2) authorizes claims of disparate impact, see\n\nMarla Ziegler, Disparate Impact Analysis and the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1038, 1050-51\n\n(1984), that reading of the statute is inaccurate.   The section\n\nrenders it \"unlawful for an employer ---\n          (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n          employees in any way which would deprive or\n          tend to deprive any individual of employment\n          opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n          his status as an employee, because of such\n          individual's age . . . .\"\n\n\n29 U.S.C. ยง 623(a)(2).   However, finding the theory lurking in\n\nthis section requires reading the language \"because of such\n\nindividual's age\" to modify \"adversely affect\" rather than to\n\nmodify \"limit, segregate, or classify.\"   Because of the placement\n\nof the commas, this is a grammatically incorrect reading.     See\n\nPamela S. Krop, Note, Age Discrimination and the Disparate Impact\n\nDoctrine, 34 Stan. L. Rev. 837, 842-43 (1982).   Moreover, as Krop\n\npoints out, section (2) parallels the language of section (1),\n\nwhich makes it unlawful for an employer --\n          (1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n          any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\n(..continued)\nthe Eighth Circuit assumed -- again without analysis -- that\ndisparate impact liability is cognizable under the ADEA.

In other words, by the statutory\n\nlanguage itself, Congress recognized that neutral policies not\n\nmotivated by discriminatory intent may be permissible employment\n\npractices.   It is difficult to imagine how Congress could have\n\nconcluded otherwise -- for application of disparate impact theory\n\ncould lead to results which Congress probably did not intend.21\n\n21\n .

Rather,\n\nresolution of that issue must await another day.    I write this\n\nsection to highlight my doubts and to say that, at any rate,\n\ndisparate impact theory should not be applied as a matter of\n\ncourse.   Here, of course, we only need hold that even if in some\n\nsituations disparate impact liability may be established under\n\nthe ADEA, this case does not present one of them.\n\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          In view of the aforesaid, we hold that an employer may\n\noffer enhanced benefits to all terminated employees agreeing to\n\nwaive all claims against the company, without providing extra\n\nconsideration to workers protected by the ADEA.    Thus, it is\n\nevident that the district court should have denied DiBiase's\n\nmotion for summary judgment and should have granted SmithKline's\n\nmotion for summary judgment on count 2 of the amended complaint.\n\nFurthermore, it is clear that there is no need for further\n\nproceedings in the district court.   See Nazay v. Miller, 949 F.2d\n\n(..continued)\nmedical insurance coverage, its decisions could have a disparate\nimpact on older employees. In that circumstance, in an ADEA\naction employers would be forced to justify their business\npractices with older employees then having the opportunity to\ndemonstrate that alternative employment practices could fulfill\nthe employer's needs.
