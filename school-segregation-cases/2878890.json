The Bankruptcy\nCourt concluded that the Plan was an unfunded “top hat” plan\nunder ERISA, and dismissed Participants’ complaint. The\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware affirmed.\n\n\n                               6\n\f       On appeal, Participants contend that certain novel\nfeatures of the Plan obligated the Corporation to fund a\nsecular trust, outside the reach of creditors, for their exclusive\nbenefit when the committee learned that the Corporation was\nfacing insolvency. We disagree, and will affirm.\n\n                                I.\n\nA.     Deferred Compensation Plans Generally\n\n       A deferred compensation plan “is an agreement by the\nemployer to pay compensation to employees at a future date.\nThe main purpose of the plan is to defer the payment of\ntaxes.” David J. Cartano, Taxation of Compensation &\nBenefits § 20.01, at 709 (2004). The idea is to defer the\nreceipt of compensation until retirement or termination of\nemployment, when the employee is in a lower tax bracket,\nthus reducing the overall amount of taxes paid. Id. at\n§ 20.02[A], at 710.\n\n       Certain deferred compensation plans, known as “top\nhat” plans, are subject to ERISA’s administrative and\nenforcement provisions, but exempt from the substantive\nprovisions that regulate plan funding and impose fiduciary\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fduties.1 Because the Participants’ claims arise under ERISA’s\nsubstantive provisions, see Pls.’ 2d Am. Compl. at 29-37, they\ndepend on a finding that the IT Group Deferred Compensa-\ntion Plan is subject to ERISA’s substantive protections, i.e.,\nthat it is not a “top hat” plan.\n\n        ERISA defines a top hat plan as:\n\n        a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an\n        employer primarily for the purpose of providing\n        deferred compensation for a select group of\n        management or highly compensated employees.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1051(2). See also 29 U.S.C. §§ 1081(a)(3),\n1101(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n    1\n     The Department of Labor has explained that Congress\nexempted “top hat” plans from ERISA’s substantive protections\nbecause it believed that, unlike other employees, management\nand highly compensated employees have sufficient bargaining\npower to negotiate favorable deferred compensation plans and\nare capable of taking the risks attendant to such plans into\naccount. Dep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit Programs,\nOp. Ltr. 90-14A, 1990 ERISA LEXIS 12, at *3-4 (May 8,\n1990).\n\n\n                               8\n\f       When a plan is “unfunded,”\n\n       [t]he employer promises to pay the employee the\n       deferred compensation at a specified time, but\n       does not set aside the funds in an escrow, trust\n       fund, or otherwise. The assets used to pay the\n       deferred compensation are the general assets of\n       the employer and are subject to the claims of the\n       employer’s creditors.\n\nCartano, at § 20.02[A], at 721. The employee is not subject\nto tax on the compensation until he or she actually receives\nthe deferred amount because “the employee may never\nreceive the money if the company becomes insolvent.” Id.\n\n        An employer may set aside deferred compensation\namounts in a segregated fund or trust without jeopardizing a\nplan’s “unfunded” status if the fund or trust remains “subject\nto the claims of the employer’s creditors in the event of\ninsolvency or bankruptcy.” Id. at § 20.05[D], at 731.\n\n      One commonly-used mechanism is the “rabbi trust,”\nwhich is\n\n       an irrevocable trust for deferred compensation.\n       Funds held by the trust are out of reach of the\n       employer, but are subject to the claims of the\n\n\n\n                               9\n\f        employer’s creditors in the event of bankruptcy\n       or insolvency.\n\n              The rabbi trust gives employees some\n       measure of security, while at the same time\n       deferring taxes. The assets set aside in the trust\n       are segregated from the employer’s other assets\n       and can be used only to pay the deferred\n       compensation. If there is a change in control of\n       the company, the new owners cannot take back\n       the assets of the trust.\n\n              The employee is not taxed until receipt of\n       benefits as long as the trust funds are subject to\n       the claims of the employer’s creditors. The\n       employer is treated as the owner of the funds and\n       taxed on all fund earnings until the date of\n       distribution.\n\nId. at § 20.05[D][3], at 735. The Department of Labor has\nopined that “a plan will not fail to be ‘unfunded’ . . . solely\nbecause there is maintained in connection with such plan a\n‘rabbi trust.’” Dep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit\nPrograms, Op. Ltr. 91-16A, 1991 ERISA LEXIS 16, at *6-7\n(Apr. 5, 1991).\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fB.     IT Corporation’s Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n        IT Corporation adopted the Plan in January of 1996.\nParticipation in the Plan was limited to “non-employee\ndirectors and to employees . . . who are part of a select group\nof management or highly compensated employees.” Plan\n¶ 2.1. The Plan document specifies that it “constitutes an\nunfunded plan,” that participants in the Plan have “no legal or\nequitable right, interest or claim in any property or assets of”\nthe Corporation or its affiliates and that the Corporation’s\nobligation under the Plan is “merely that of an unfunded and\nunsecured promise to pay money in the future.” Plan ¶ 13.1.\nThe Plan is administered by a committee established by the\nCorporation’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Plan\n¶ 10.1.\n\n        IT Corporation agreed to establish a trust in connection\nwith the Plan, Plan ¶ 1.28, and to “transfer over to the Trust\nsuch assets, if any, as the Committee determines, from time to\ntime and in its sole discretion, are appropriate,” Plan ¶ 12.1.\nAt the same time that it adopted the Plan, the Corporation\nadopted a “Master Trust Agreement for Deferred\nCompensation Plans.” The Trust Agreement provided that\nassets contributed to the Trust were to be held “subject to the\nclaims of the Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ creditors in the\nevent of their Insolvency,” and that the Trust would not\n“affect the status of the Plans as unfunded plans maintained\nfor the purpose of providing supplemental compensation for a\n\n\n                               11\n\fselect group of management, highly compensated employees\nand/or Directors for purposes of Title I of ERISA.” Trust\n¶ 1.2.\n\nC.       Procedural History\n\n        IT Group, IT Corporation and other affiliated\nsubsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11\non January 16, 2002 in the Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware. On September 4, 2002, Participants filed the\nadversary complaint that began this proceeding. They named\nIT Group, all of its subsidiaries in bankruptcy, various former\nexecutive officers of IT Group and Carlyle Partners II, LP, a\nmajor shareholder of IT Group, as defendants. Participants\nclaimed that the Plan did not qualify for “unfunded,” “top\nhat” status under ERISA, and was thus subject to ERISA’s\nfunding and fiduciary duty requirements. Under this theory,\nParticipants contend that IT Corporation had a duty to set\naside, in a trust for Participants’ exclusive benefit, i.e., beyond\nthe reach of the Corporation’s creditors, assets sufficient to\nsatisfy the Corporation’s obligations under the Plan. The\nexecutive and shareholder defendants, correspondingly, owed\nParticipants fiduciary duties under ERISA to ensure that the\ntrust was funded before the bankruptcy petition date.2\n\n\n     2\n   Participants also set forth state law causes of action in their\ncomplaint, see 2d Am. Compl. at 37-47, App. at 257-267, but do\nnot appeal the dismissal of those claims.\n\n                                12\n\f       Participants’ complaint relied principally on the Plan\nand Trust documents, but also alleged that a former President\nand CEO of IT Corporation orally promised a senior officer\nand other potential Plan participants that the Corporation\nwould fund the Trust for the exclusive benefit of plan\nparticipants and ensure that benefits would be paid in full if\nthe Corporation ever faced the prospect of insolvency or\nbankruptcy. 2d Am. Compl. at 8.\n\n       The defendants filed, and the Bankruptcy Court\ngranted, a consolidated motion to dismiss Participants’ claims.\nThe Court found that the Plan was “unfunded” and offered\nonly to a “select group of management or highly compensated\nemployees,” and was, thus, a top hat plan exempt from\nERISA’s substantive protections. Participants appealed to the\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware; the District Court\naffirmed.\n\n                               II.\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction to hear Participants’\nappeal from the Bankruptcy Court’s final order dismissing\ntheir adversary complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(a); our\njurisdiction over the appeal from the District Court’s order\narises under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d).\n\n       On appeal, “we stand in the shoes of the district court,\napplying a clearly erroneous standard to the bankruptcy\n\n\n                               13\n\fcourt’s findings of fact and a plenary standard to that court’s\nlegal conclusions.” Am. Flint Glass Workers Union v. Anchor\nResolution Corp., 197 F.3d 76, 80 (3d Cir. 1999). Because\nthe District and Bankruptcy Courts dismissed Participants’\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could\nbe granted, a purely legal question, we review their decisions\nde novo. Id.\n\n        In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we accept all factual\nallegations in the complaint as true and view them in the light\nmost favorable to the plaintiffs. We may not dismiss a\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted unless we find that the plaintiff can prove no set of\nfacts that would entitle him to relief. Pryor v. Nat’l\nCollegiate Athletic Ass’n, 288 F.3d 548, 559 (3d Cir. 2002).\nWe may consider documents that are attached to or submitted\nwith the complaint and any legal arguments presented in the\nbriefs and arguments of counsel. Id. at 360.\n\n                              III.\n\n       The primary issue before us, as in the Bankruptcy and\nDistrict Court proceedings, is whether the Plan qualifies for\nthe top hat exemption from ERISA’s substantive provisions.\nBecause Participants do not challenge those courts’\ndeterminations that the Plan was offered only to management\nand highly compensated employees, the only remaining\nquestion is whether the Plan was, in fact, “unfunded.”\n\n\n                              14\n\f                               A.\n\n       ERISA does not specify, and we have not previously\nconsidered, what requirements a plan must meet in order to be\nconsidered “unfunded” for purposes of exemption from\nERISA’s substantive provisions.3 However, the decisions of\nother courts of appeals provide useful guidance in this regard.\n\n       Other courts of appeals that have examined this issue\nhave focused primarily on what are essentially two sides of\nthe same coin: whether the corporation has set aside funds,\nseparate from its general assets, for payment of plan benefits\nand whether the beneficiaries have a legal right greater than\n\n\n\n   3\n     In previous cases involving deferred compensation plans\noffered to management and highly compensated employees, we\nhave always assumed, without further examination, that\nERISA’s “top hat” exemption applies. See, e.g., Goldstein v.\nJohnson & Johnson, 251 F.3d 433, 435 (3d Cir. 2001)\n(considering the proper scope of judicial review of an\nadministrator’s decision to deny benefits owed under a top hat\nplan); Senior Executive Benefit Plan Participants v. New Valley\nCorp. (In re New Valley Corp.), 89 F.3d 143, 148 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(“Both plans at issue are top hat plans . . . .”); Kemmerer v. ICI\nAmericas Inc., 70 F.3d 281, 284 (3d Cir. 1995) (“The dispute on\nappeal centers around [an] executive deferred compensation\nplan, which like all such plans is commonly referred to as a ‘top\nhat’ plan.”).\n\n                               15\n\f that of a general, unsecured creditor to the corporation’s\nassets.\n\n        The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has examined this\nissue from both sides. In considering whether a death benefit\nplan supported by a life insurance policy was subject to\nERISA’s substantive requirements, it stated that “[f]unding\nimplies the existence of a res separate from the ordinary assets\nof the corporation.” Dependahl v. Falstaff Brewing Corp.,\n653 F.2d 1208, 1214 (8th Cir. 1981). The plan was “funded”\nbecause the insurance policy provided “a res separate from\nthe corporation” to which beneficiaries could look for\npayment of benefits under the plan. Id. On the other hand, an\nexcess benefit plan that specified that the rights of the\nbeneficiary under the plan would “be solely those of an\nunsecured creditor” was unfunded, even though the employer\nhad purchased an insurance policy to help it finance the plan,\nbecause the policy in that case “simply became a general,\nunpledged, unrestricted asset of the [employer] and those . . .\nassets in turn would be used to fund [the] plan.” Belsky v.\nFirst Nat’l Life Ins. Co., 818 F.2d 661, 663-64 (8th Cir.\n1987).\n\n       Similarly, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has\nobserved that a plan under which benefits were to be paid\n“‘solely from the general assets of the employer’” is\nunfunded. Demery v. Extebank Deferred Compensation Plan,\n216 F.3d 283, 287 (2d Cir. 2000) (quoting Gallione v.\n\n\n                               16\n\fFlaherty, 70 F.3d 724, 725 (2d Cir. 1995)). More recently, it\nadopted a standard first articulated in Miller v. Heller, 915 F.\nSupp. 651 (S.D.N.Y. 1996):\n\n       the question a court must ask in determining\n       whether a plan is unfunded is: “can the\n       beneficiary establish, through the plan documents,\n       a legal right any greater than that of an unsecured\n       creditor to a specific set of funds from which the\n       employer is, under the terms of the plan, obligated\n       to pay the deferred compensation?”\n\nDemery, 216 F.3d at 287 (quoting Miller, 915 F. Supp. at\n660). Applying this test, the court found that a deferred\ncompensation plan that was financed using life insurance\ncontracts, the proceeds of which were kept in a separate\naccount, was unfunded. According to the court, the plan’s\nterms did not “give plaintiffs a greater legal right to the funds\nin the Deferred Compensation Liability Account than that\npossessed by an unsecured creditor.” Id. Although the\naccount was separate, it was part of the “general assets” of the\ncorporation, and the plan was therefore “unfunded as a matter\nof law.” Id.\n\n       The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals employed a similar\nanalysis, but also considered the tax treatment of the plan. In\nReliable Home Health Care, Inc. v. Union Central Insurance\nCo., 295 F.3d 505 (5th Cir. 2002), it surveyed the decisions of\n\n\n                               17\n\fthe other courts of appeals, and noted that the Department of\nLabor had provided the following guidance: “‘[A]ny\ndetermination of the ‘unfunded’ status of an ‘excess benefit’\nor ‘top hat’ plan of deferred compensation requires an\nexamination of the facts and circumstances, including the\nstatus of the plan under non-ERISA law.’” Id. at 513 (quoting\nDep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit Programs, Op.\nLtr. 92-13A, 1992 ERISA LEXIS 14, at *7 (May 19, 1992)).\nMore specifically, the court emphasized DOL’s advice that\nthe tax consequences of the plan should be considered in the\nanalysis, id. (citing DOL Op. Ltr. 92-13A, 1992 ERISA\nLEXIS 14, at *7), and noted a district court’s holding that “a\n‘plan is more likely than not to be regarded as unfunded if the\nbeneficiaries under the plan do not incur tax liability during\nthe year that the contributions to the plan are made,’” id. at\n514 (quoting Miller, 915 F. Supp. at 659). Combining all of\nthis information, the court devised the following test:\n\n       in determining whether a plan is “funded” or\n       “unfunded” under ERISA, a court must first look\n       to the surrounding facts and circumstances,\n       including the status of the plan under non-ERISA\n       law. Second, a court should identify whether a\n       [plan] is funded by a res separate from the general\n       assets of the company.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                               18\n\f        The Reliable court concluded, under this test, that a\ndeath benefit plan was unfunded. Like the plans at issue in\nDemery and Belsky, the plan was financed through the\npurchase of life insurance contracts on behalf of participating\nemployees. However, those contracts belonged to the\ncompany, not the participating employees. Plan participants\nwere prohibited from contributing to the plan, and did not\ntreat the company’s contributions to the plan on their behalf\nas taxable income. Thus, the plan was unfunded and exempt\nfrom ERISA’s substantive provisions. Id. at 514-15.\n\n       We agree with our fellow courts of appeals that the\nkeys to the determination of whether a plan is “funded” or\n“unfunded” under ERISA are (1) whether beneficiaries of the\nplan can look to a res separate from the general assets of the\ncorporation to satisfy their claims; (2) whether beneficiaries\nof the plan have a legal right greater than that of general,\nunsecured creditors to the assets of the corporation or to some\nspecific subset of corporate assets. We may also consider the\nplan’s intended and actual tax treatment.4 We will analyze the\n\n  4\n    As noted above, a plan under which the beneficiaries do not\nincur tax liability during the year that the contributions to the\nplan are made is “more likely than not” an “unfunded” plan.\nMiller v. Heller, 915 F. Supp. 651, 659 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). This\nis so because the tests for taxation of deferred compensation and\nfor funding status overlap–deferred compensation is not taxable\nas current income only where the future payment of the\ncompensation is somehow uncertain, i.e., where the assets used\n\n                               19\n\fIT Corporation Plan accordingly.\n\n                              B.\n\n        The IT Corporation Plan is an unfunded top hat plan\nunder ERISA. At the outset, we note that the Plan and Trust\ndocuments express, in no uncertain terms, IT Corporation’s\nintent to create an unfunded plan. The “Purpose” section of\nthe Plan document provides that the “Plan constitutes an\nunfunded plan.” And the Trust document explicitly states that\nthe Trust “shall not affect the status of the Plans as unfunded\nplans . . . for purposes of Title I of ERISA.” Trust ¶ 1.2.\n\n        Beyond the Corporation’s stated intent, an examination\nof the factors set forth above fully supports our conclusion.\nFirst, there is no res separate from IT Corporation’s general\nassets to which Participants can look to satisfy their claims.\nAlthough the Plan document provides for, and the Trust\ndocument establishes, a “Trust” for participants’ benefit, no\nfunds were ever deposited into the Trust. And Participants’\n\n\nto pay participants’ claims are also subject to other creditors’\nclaims. Thus, the fact that a plan qualifies for deferred tax\ntreatment strongly supports the conclusion that it was unfunded.\nSee Dep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit Programs, Op.\nLtr. 92-13A, 1992 ERISA LEXIS 14, at *7 (May 19, 1992)\n(noting that “the tax consequences to trust beneficiaries should\nbe accorded significant weight” in determining whether a plan\nis “funded” or “unfunded”).\n\n                              20\n\f“account balances,” listed on their annual benefit statements,\ndo not reflect actual deposits held in a particular location; the\nPlan specifically states that each balance is a “bookkeeping\nentry only,” designed to “be utilized solely as a device for the\nmeasurement and determination of amounts to be paid to or in\nrespect of a Participant pursuant to the Plan.” Plan ¶ 1.2.\n\n        Second, even if the Trust were funded, Participants’\nlegal rights to its assets, and to the assets of the Corporation\nas a whole, are no greater than those of the Corporation’s\ngeneral, unsecured creditors. The Deferred Compensation\nPlan Questions & Answers, which was circulated to potential\nparticipants along with the Plan document, explains that the\nTrust is a “‘Rabbi Trust’” that “does not provide security in\nthe event that IT Corporation or its subsidiaries become\ninsolvent or file for bankruptcy.”5 Moreover, the Trust\ndocument unequivocally establishes that Trust assets are\nsubject to creditors’ claims in the event of insolvency, and\nthat such claims are on par with those of Plan participants.\nSee, e.g., Trust ¶ 1.3 (“The Participants and their\n\n\n\n\n   5\n    As noted above, the DOL has opined that a “rabbi trust”\nmaintained in connection with a deferred compensation plan\nwill not undermine the plan’s “unfunded” status. See Dep’t of\nLabor, Pension & Welfare Benefit Programs, Op. Ltr.\n91-16A , 1991 ERISA LEXIS 16, at *6-7 (Apr. 5, 1991).\n\n                               21\n\fBeneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any\nbeneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust. . . .\nAny assets held by the Trust will be subject to the claims of\nthe Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ general creditors under\nfederal and state law in the event of Insolvency . . . .”);\nTrust ¶ 3.6(a) (“To the extent that any Participant or\nBeneficiary acquires the right to receive payments under any\nof the Plans, such right shall be no greater than that of an\nunsecured general creditor of the Company and the\nSubsidiaries and such Participant or Beneficiary shall have\nonly the unsecured promise of the Company and the\nSubsidiaries that such payments shall be made.”).\n\n        The Plan document similarly limits Participants’ legal\nrights to IT Corporation’s general corporate assets. E.g., Plan\n¶ 13.1 (“Participants . . . shall have no legal or equitable right,\ninterest or claim in any property or assets of an Employer. . . .\nAn Employer’s obligation under the Plan shall be merely that\nof an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the\nfuture.”).\n\n       Finally, we note that Participants did not pay taxes on\n\n\n\n\n                                22\n\fthe compensation that they deferred under the Plan.6\n\n        Participants do not mount much of a challenge to any\nof the foregoing (aside from our consideration of the tax\ntreatment of the Plan, see supra note 6). Instead, they argue\nthat this analysis fails to take into account other facts and\ncircumstances that render the Plan “funded.” Participants\nadvance two arguments in this regard. We address each\ntheory in turn.\n\n                               C.\n\n        The “centerpiece” of Participants’ claim, see\nAppellants’ Br. at 22, is that the Plan document obligated the\nPlan’s administrative committee to create and fund a secular\ntrust for their exclusive benefit in the event of impending\ninsolvency. More specifically, they argue: (1) that paragraph\n\n\n    6\n      Participants argue that the tax treatment of the Plan is\n“irrelevant.” Although they acknowledge that they did not\nreport deferred compensation as income for tax purposes, they\ncontend that the Plan as drafted “was never entitled to favorable\ntax treatment” because of the administrative committee’s alleged\nobligation to fund an exclusive benefit trust on their behalf in\nthe event of insolvency. Appellants’ Br. at 38. Given that\nParticipants benefitted from this tax treatment when the\nCorporation was solvent, their argument seems more than a little\ndisingenuous. Moreover, as we discuss in Section III.C below,\nwe reject Participants’ characterization of the Plan.\n\n                               23\n\f12.1 of the Plan document,7 which gives the Plan’s\nadministrative committee “sole discretion” over the funding\ndecisions related to the Plan, implies a duty to actually fund\nthe Trust in “good faith”; (2) that the duty of good faith\ncarries an obligation to avoid forfeitures, which, in this case,\ncould only have been accomplished by funding an exclusive\nbenefit trust before the Corporation became insolvent; and\n(3) that the Corporation “pre-approved,” in the Trust\ndocument, an amendment to the Trust that would convert it\nfrom a “rabbi trust,” susceptible to general creditors’ claims,\ninto a secular trust for the exclusive benefit of Plan\nparticipants. Thus, Participants conclude, they have a legal\nright to payment of Plan benefits greater than that of the\nCorporation’s general, unsecured creditors.\n\n        We need not dwell on this argument for long, because\nwe reject its fundamental premise. Although we have\nrecognized that terms of top hat plans that confer discretion to\nplan administrators are subject to the implied duty of good\nfaith, Goldstein v. Johnson & Johnson, 251 F.3d 433, 448 (3d\nCir. 2001), that duty does not extend as far as Participants\n\n\n  7\n   The full text of paragraph 12.1 is as follows:\n\n       The Employers shall establish the Trust and shall\n       transfer over to the Trust such assets, if any, as\n       the Committee determines, from time to time and\n       in its sole discretion, are appropriate.\n\n                               24\n\fcontend. The implied duty of good faith is merely an\n“interpretive tool to determine the parties’ justifiable\nexpectations,” Northview Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors\nCorp., 227 F.3d 78, 91 (3d Cir. 2000); it may not be used to\nadd new terms to an agreement, Lorenz v. CSX Corp., 1 F.3d\n1406, 1415 (3d Cir. 1993), or to override express contractual\nterms, Northview, 227 F.3d at 91. For Participants to succeed,\nwe would have to do just that–to hold that the duty requires\nthe Plan’s administrative committee to fund a trust for their\nexclusive benefit. This runs directly afoul of the Plan’s stated\npurpose to remain “unfunded” for ERISA purposes and its\nexpress provision that Participants are not entitled to any\n“legal or equitable right, interest or claim in any property or\nassets of” the Company, and that the Company’s obligation\nunder the Plan “shall be merely that of an unfunded and\nunsecured promise to pay money in the future.” Plan ¶ 13.1.\n\n       Participants urge that at least one court has used the\ndoctrine of “necessary implication” to imply an obligation to\nfund an employee benefit plan that was not expressly\nprovided in the terms of the plan. See Killian v. McCulloch,\n850 F. Supp. 1239, 1250-51 (E.D. Pa. 1994). However, that\ndoctrine is only employed to\n\n       imply an agreement by the parties to a contract to\n       do and perform those things that according to\n       reason and justice they should do in order to\n       carry out the purpose for which the contract was\n\n\n                              25\n\f       made and to refrain from doing anything that\n       would destroy or injure the other party’s right to\n       receive the fruits of the contract.\n\nId. (quoting Somers v. Somers, 419 Pa. Super. 131, 613 A.2d\n1211, 1212 (1992)) (emphasis added). It does not apply\nwhere, as here, the implied agreement would not accomplish\neither of those goals, but would destroy, rather than carry out,\nthe express purpose of the Plan. Here, the Committee, in\nfailing to fund the trust, did nothing to destroy or injure\nParticipants’ rights under the Plan–the Plan granted them only\na limited, unsecured right to future payment.\n\n        Participants would have us employ the implied duty of\ngood faith and the doctrine of necessary implication to expand\ntheir rights under the Plan, not to “carry out the purpose” for\nwhich it was created. To accept Participants’ argument would\nrequire us to depart significantly from our previous decisions\nregarding the scope of the implied duty of good faith, to\nbroaden the doctrine of “necessary implication” and to\ndisregard the plain and unambiguous language of the Plan and\nTrust documents. We cannot, and will not, do so.\n\n                              D.\n\n       Participants’ second claim relies on parol evidence, in\nthe form of an alleged oral representation made by the former\nPresident and CEO of IT Corporation to various Plan\n\n\n                              26\n\fparticipants, to establish that the plan was “funded.” In their\ncomplaint, Participants alleged that the former President and\nCEO assured prospective participants that, in the event of\ninsolvency, the Trust would be funded and they would be paid\nin full.\n\n       Participants argue, first, that terms of the Plan and\nTrust documents that give the Plan’s administrative\ncommittee discretion to fund the Trust create ambiguity as to\nthe Plan’s intended funding status, and, second, that the\nalleged representation should be used to resolve that\nambiguity. See Senior Executive Benefit Plan Participants v.\nNew Valley Corp. (In re New Valley Corp.), 89 F.3d 143, 150\n(3d Cir. 1996) (“[O]nce a contract provision is found to be\nambiguous, extrinsic evidence must be considered to clarify\nits meaning.”).\n\n       We disagree. As discussed above, the terms of the\nPlan and Trust documents clearly and unambiguously evince\nthe Corporation’s intent to create an unfunded top hat plan.\nMoreover, as the Bankruptcy Court observed, the oral\nrepresentation alleged by Participants “would add an\nadditional term to the contract regarding funding; it would not\nshed light on the written terms of the Plan.” IT Group, Inc. v.\nBookspan (In re IT Group, Inc.), 305 B.R. 402, 411 (Bankr.\nD. Del. 2004). Thus, the oral representation does not\n\n\n\n\n                              27\n\fundermine our initial conclusion that the Plan is unfunded,\nand has no place in our analysis.\n\n                             IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the\nBankruptcy and District Courts that Participants’ claims\nshould be dismissed. We will accordingly AFFIRM the\nDistrict Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n                              28\n\f",

Deferred Compensation Plans Generally\n\n       A deferred compensation plan “is an agreement by the\nemployer to pay compensation to employees at a future date.\nThe main purpose of the plan is to defer the payment of\ntaxes.” David J. Cartano, Taxation of Compensation &\nBenefits § 20.01, at 709 (2004). The idea is to defer the\nreceipt of compensation until retirement or termination of\nemployment, when the employee is in a lower tax bracket,\nthus reducing the overall amount of taxes paid. Id. at\n§ 20.02[A], at 710.\n\n       Certain deferred compensation plans, known as “top\nhat” plans, are subject to ERISA’s administrative and\nenforcement provisions, but exempt from the substantive\nprovisions that regulate plan funding and impose fiduciary\n\n\n\n\n                                7\n\fduties.1 Because the Participants’ claims arise under ERISA’s\nsubstantive provisions, see Pls.’ 2d Am. Compl. at 29-37, they\ndepend on a finding that the IT Group Deferred Compensa-\ntion Plan is subject to ERISA’s substantive protections, i.e.,\nthat it is not a “top hat” plan.\n\n        ERISA defines a top hat plan as:\n\n        a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an\n        employer primarily for the purpose of providing\n        deferred compensation for a select group of\n        management or highly compensated employees.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1051(2). See also 29 U.S.C. §§ 1081(a)(3),\n1101(a)(1).\n\n\n\n\n    1\n     The Department of Labor has explained that Congress\nexempted “top hat” plans from ERISA’s substantive protections\nbecause it believed that, unlike other employees, management\nand highly compensated employees have sufficient bargaining\npower to negotiate favorable deferred compensation plans and\nare capable of taking the risks attendant to such plans into\naccount.

Ltr. 90-14A, 1990 ERISA LEXIS 12, at *3-4 (May 8,\n1990).\n\n\n                               8\n\f       When a plan is “unfunded,”\n\n       [t]he employer promises to pay the employee the\n       deferred compensation at a specified time, but\n       does not set aside the funds in an escrow, trust\n       fund, or otherwise. The assets used to pay the\n       deferred compensation are the general assets of\n       the employer and are subject to the claims of the\n       employer’s creditors.\n\nCartano, at § 20.02[A], at 721. The employee is not subject\nto tax on the compensation until he or she actually receives\nthe deferred amount because “the employee may never\nreceive the money if the company becomes insolvent.” Id.\n\n        An employer may set aside deferred compensation\namounts in a segregated fund or trust without jeopardizing a\nplan’s “unfunded” status if the fund or trust remains “subject\nto the claims of the employer’s creditors in the event of\ninsolvency or bankruptcy.” Id. at § 20.05[D], at 731.\n\n      One commonly-used mechanism is the “rabbi trust,”\nwhich is\n\n       an irrevocable trust for deferred compensation.\n       Funds held by the trust are out of reach of the\n       employer, but are subject to the claims of the\n\n\n\n                               9\n\f        employer’s creditors in the event of bankruptcy\n       or insolvency.\n\n              The rabbi trust gives employees some\n       measure of security, while at the same time\n       deferring taxes. The assets set aside in the trust\n       are segregated from the employer’s other assets\n       and can be used only to pay the deferred\n       compensation. If there is a change in control of\n       the company, the new owners cannot take back\n       the assets of the trust.\n\n              The employee is not taxed until receipt of\n       benefits as long as the trust funds are subject to\n       the claims of the employer’s creditors. The\n       employer is treated as the owner of the funds and\n       taxed on all fund earnings until the date of\n       distribution.\n\nId. at § 20.05[D][3], at 735. The Department of Labor has\nopined that “a plan will not fail to be ‘unfunded’ . . . solely\nbecause there is maintained in connection with such plan a\n‘rabbi trust.’” Dep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit\nPrograms, Op. Ltr. 91-16A, 1991 ERISA LEXIS 16, at *6-7\n(Apr. 5, 1991).\n\n\n\n\n                               10\n\fB.     IT Corporation’s Deferred Compensation Plan\n\n        IT Corporation adopted the Plan in January of 1996.\nParticipation in the Plan was limited to “non-employee\ndirectors and to employees . . . who are part of a select group\nof management or highly compensated employees.” Plan\n¶ 2.1. The Plan document specifies that it “constitutes an\nunfunded plan,” that participants in the Plan have “no legal or\nequitable right, interest or claim in any property or assets of”\nthe Corporation or its affiliates and that the Corporation’s\nobligation under the Plan is “merely that of an unfunded and\nunsecured promise to pay money in the future.” Plan ¶ 13.1.\nThe Plan is administered by a committee established by the\nCorporation’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Plan\n¶ 10.1.\n\n        IT Corporation agreed to establish a trust in connection\nwith the Plan, Plan ¶ 1.28, and to “transfer over to the Trust\nsuch assets, if any, as the Committee determines, from time to\ntime and in its sole discretion, are appropriate,” Plan ¶ 12.1.\nAt the same time that it adopted the Plan, the Corporation\nadopted a “Master Trust Agreement for Deferred\nCompensation Plans.” The Trust Agreement provided that\nassets contributed to the Trust were to be held “subject to the\nclaims of the Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ creditors in the\nevent of their Insolvency,” and that the Trust would not\n“affect the status of the Plans as unfunded plans maintained\nfor the purpose of providing supplemental compensation for a\n\n\n                               11\n\fselect group of management, highly compensated employees\nand/or Directors for purposes of Title I of ERISA.” Trust\n¶ 1.2.\n\nC.       Procedural History\n\n        IT Group, IT Corporation and other affiliated\nsubsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11\non January 16, 2002 in the Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware. On September 4, 2002, Participants filed the\nadversary complaint that began this proceeding. They named\nIT Group, all of its subsidiaries in bankruptcy, various former\nexecutive officers of IT Group and Carlyle Partners II, LP, a\nmajor shareholder of IT Group, as defendants. Participants\nclaimed that the Plan did not qualify for “unfunded,” “top\nhat” status under ERISA, and was thus subject to ERISA’s\nfunding and fiduciary duty requirements. Under this theory,\nParticipants contend that IT Corporation had a duty to set\naside, in a trust for Participants’ exclusive benefit, i.e., beyond\nthe reach of the Corporation’s creditors, assets sufficient to\nsatisfy the Corporation’s obligations under the Plan. The\nexecutive and shareholder defendants, correspondingly, owed\nParticipants fiduciary duties under ERISA to ensure that the\ntrust was funded before the bankruptcy petition date.2\n\n\n     2\n   Participants also set forth state law causes of action in their\ncomplaint, see 2d Am. Compl. at 37-47, App. at 257-267, but do\nnot appeal the dismissal of those claims.\n\n                                12\n\f       Participants’ complaint relied principally on the Plan\nand Trust documents, but also alleged that a former President\nand CEO of IT Corporation orally promised a senior officer\nand other potential Plan participants that the Corporation\nwould fund the Trust for the exclusive benefit of plan\nparticipants and ensure that benefits would be paid in full if\nthe Corporation ever faced the prospect of insolvency or\nbankruptcy. 2d Am. Compl. at 8.\n\n       The defendants filed, and the Bankruptcy Court\ngranted, a consolidated motion to dismiss Participants’ claims.\nThe Court found that the Plan was “unfunded” and offered\nonly to a “select group of management or highly compensated\nemployees,” and was, thus, a top hat plan exempt from\nERISA’s substantive protections. Participants appealed to the\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware; the District Court\naffirmed.\n\n                               II.\n\n        The District Court had jurisdiction to hear Participants’\nappeal from the Bankruptcy Court’s final order dismissing\ntheir adversary complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(a); our\njurisdiction over the appeal from the District Court’s order\narises under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d).\n\n       On appeal, “we stand in the shoes of the district court,\napplying a clearly erroneous standard to the bankruptcy\n\n\n                               13\n\fcourt’s findings of fact and a plenary standard to that court’s\nlegal conclusions.” Am.

More recently, it\nadopted a standard first articulated in Miller v. Heller, 915 F.\nSupp. 651 (S.D.N.Y. 1996):\n\n       the question a court must ask in determining\n       whether a plan is unfunded is: “can the\n       beneficiary establish, through the plan documents,\n       a legal right any greater than that of an unsecured\n       creditor to a specific set of funds from which the\n       employer is, under the terms of the plan, obligated\n       to pay the deferred compensation?”\n\nDemery, 216 F.3d at 287 (quoting Miller, 915 F. Supp. at\n660). Applying this test, the court found that a deferred\ncompensation plan that was financed using life insurance\ncontracts, the proceeds of which were kept in a separate\naccount, was unfunded. According to the court, the plan’s\nterms did not “give plaintiffs a greater legal right to the funds\nin the Deferred Compensation Liability Account than that\npossessed by an unsecured creditor.” Id. Although the\naccount was separate, it was part of the “general assets” of the\ncorporation, and the plan was therefore “unfunded as a matter\nof law.” Id.\n\n       The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals employed a similar\nanalysis, but also considered the tax treatment of the plan. In\nReliable Home Health Care, Inc. v. Union Central Insurance\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"28181\"><a href=\"/opinion/28181/reliable-home-health-v-union-central-ins-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">505</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2002), it surveyed the decisions of\n\n\n                               17\n\fthe other courts of appeals, and noted that the Department of\nLabor had provided the following guidance: “‘[A]ny\ndetermination of the ‘unfunded’ status of an ‘excess benefit’\nor ‘top hat’ plan of deferred compensation requires an\nexamination of the facts and circumstances, including the\nstatus of the plan under non-ERISA law.’” Id. at 513 (quoting\nDep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit Programs, Op.\nLtr. 92-13A, 1992 ERISA LEXIS 14, at *7 (May 19, 1992)).\nMore specifically, the court emphasized DOL’s advice that\nthe tax consequences of the plan should be considered in the\nanalysis, id. (citing DOL Op. Ltr. 92-13A, 1992 ERISA\nLEXIS 14, at *7), and noted a district court’s holding that “a\n‘plan is more likely than not to be regarded as unfunded if the\nbeneficiaries under the plan do not incur tax liability during\nthe year that the contributions to the plan are made,’” id. at\n514 (quoting Miller, 915 F. Supp. at 659). Combining all of\nthis information, the court devised the following test:\n\n       in determining whether a plan is “funded” or\n       “unfunded” under ERISA, a court must first look\n       to the surrounding facts and circumstances,\n       including the status of the plan under non-ERISA\n       law. Second, a court should identify whether a\n       [plan] is funded by a res separate from the general\n       assets of the company.\n\nId.\n\n\n\n                               18\n\f        The Reliable court concluded, under this test, that a\ndeath benefit plan was unfunded. Like the plans at issue in\nDemery and Belsky, the plan was financed through the\npurchase of life insurance contracts on behalf of participating\nemployees. However, those contracts belonged to the\ncompany, not the participating employees. Plan participants\nwere prohibited from contributing to the plan, and did not\ntreat the company’s contributions to the plan on their behalf\nas taxable income. Thus, the plan was unfunded and exempt\nfrom ERISA’s substantive provisions. Id. at 514-15.\n\n       We agree with our fellow courts of appeals that the\nkeys to the determination of whether a plan is “funded” or\n“unfunded” under ERISA are (1) whether beneficiaries of the\nplan can look to a res separate from the general assets of the\ncorporation to satisfy their claims; (2) whether beneficiaries\nof the plan have a legal right greater than that of general,\nunsecured creditors to the assets of the corporation or to some\nspecific subset of corporate assets. We may also consider the\nplan’s intended and actual tax treatment.4 We will analyze the\n\n  4\n    As noted above, a plan under which the beneficiaries do not\nincur tax liability during the year that the contributions to the\nplan are made is “more likely than not” an “unfunded” plan.\nMiller v. Heller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618430\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618430/miller-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This\nis so because the tests for taxation of deferred compensation and\nfor funding status overlap–deferred compensation is not taxable\nas current income only where the future payment of the\ncompensation is somehow uncertain, i.e., where the assets used\n\n                               19\n\fIT Corporation Plan accordingly.\n\n                              B.\n\n        The IT Corporation Plan is an unfunded top hat plan\nunder ERISA. At the outset, we note that the Plan and Trust\ndocuments express, in no uncertain terms, IT Corporation’s\nintent to create an unfunded plan. The “Purpose” section of\nthe Plan document provides that the “Plan constitutes an\nunfunded plan.” And the Trust document explicitly states that\nthe Trust “shall not affect the status of the Plans as unfunded\nplans . . . for purposes of Title I of ERISA.” Trust ¶ 1.2.\n\n        Beyond the Corporation’s stated intent, an examination\nof the factors set forth above fully supports our conclusion.\nFirst, there is no res separate from IT Corporation’s general\nassets to which Participants can look to satisfy their claims.\nAlthough the Plan document provides for, and the Trust\ndocument establishes, a “Trust” for participants’ benefit, no\nfunds were ever deposited into the Trust. And Participants’\n\n\nto pay participants’ claims are also subject to other creditors’\nclaims. Thus, the fact that a plan qualifies for deferred tax\ntreatment strongly supports the conclusion that it was unfunded.\nSee Dep’t of Labor, Pension & Welfare Benefit Programs, Op.\nLtr. 92-13A, 1992 ERISA LEXIS 14, at *7 (May 19, 1992)\n(noting that “the tax consequences to trust beneficiaries should\nbe accorded significant weight” in determining whether a plan\nis “funded” or “unfunded”).\n\n                              20\n\f“account balances,” listed on their annual benefit statements,\ndo not reflect actual deposits held in a particular location; the\nPlan specifically states that each balance is a “bookkeeping\nentry only,” designed to “be utilized solely as a device for the\nmeasurement and determination of amounts to be paid to or in\nrespect of a Participant pursuant to the Plan.” Plan ¶ 1.2.\n\n        Second, even if the Trust were funded, Participants’\nlegal rights to its assets, and to the assets of the Corporation\nas a whole, are no greater than those of the Corporation’s\ngeneral, unsecured creditors. The Deferred Compensation\nPlan Questions & Answers, which was circulated to potential\nparticipants along with the Plan document, explains that the\nTrust is a “‘Rabbi Trust’” that “does not provide security in\nthe event that IT Corporation or its subsidiaries become\ninsolvent or file for bankruptcy.”5 Moreover, the Trust\ndocument unequivocally establishes that Trust assets are\nsubject to creditors’ claims in the event of insolvency, and\nthat such claims are on par with those of Plan participants.\nSee, e.g., Trust ¶ 1.3 (“The Participants and their\n\n\n\n\n   5\n    As noted above, the DOL has opined that a “rabbi trust”\nmaintained in connection with a deferred compensation plan\nwill not undermine the plan’s “unfunded” status.

Ltr.\n91-16A , 1991 ERISA LEXIS 16, at *6-7 (Apr. 5, 1991).\n\n                               21\n\fBeneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any\nbeneficial ownership interest in, any assets of the Trust. . . .\nAny assets held by the Trust will be subject to the claims of\nthe Company’s and the Subsidiaries’ general creditors under\nfederal and state law in the event of Insolvency . . . .”);\nTrust ¶ 3.6(a) (“To the extent that any Participant or\nBeneficiary acquires the right to receive payments under any\nof the Plans, such right shall be no greater than that of an\nunsecured general creditor of the Company and the\nSubsidiaries and such Participant or Beneficiary shall have\nonly the unsecured promise of the Company and the\nSubsidiaries that such payments shall be made.”).\n\n        The Plan document similarly limits Participants’ legal\nrights to IT Corporation’s general corporate assets. E.g., Plan\n¶ 13.1 (“Participants . . . shall have no legal or equitable right,\ninterest or claim in any property or assets of an Employer. . . .\nAn Employer’s obligation under the Plan shall be merely that\nof an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the\nfuture.”).\n\n       Finally, we note that Participants did not pay taxes on\n\n\n\n\n                                22\n\fthe compensation that they deferred under the Plan.6\n\n        Participants do not mount much of a challenge to any\nof the foregoing (aside from our consideration of the tax\ntreatment of the Plan, see supra note 6). Instead, they argue\nthat this analysis fails to take into account other facts and\ncircumstances that render the Plan “funded.” Participants\nadvance two arguments in this regard. We address each\ntheory in turn.\n\n                               C.\n\n        The “centerpiece” of Participants’ claim, see\nAppellants’ Br. at 22, is that the Plan document obligated the\nPlan’s administrative committee to create and fund a secular\ntrust for their exclusive benefit in the event of impending\ninsolvency. More specifically, they argue: (1) that paragraph\n\n\n    6\n      Participants argue that the tax treatment of the Plan is\n“irrelevant.” Although they acknowledge that they did not\nreport deferred compensation as income for tax purposes, they\ncontend that the Plan as drafted “was never entitled to favorable\ntax treatment” because of the administrative committee’s alleged\nobligation to fund an exclusive benefit trust on their behalf in\nthe event of insolvency. Appellants’ Br. at 38. Given that\nParticipants benefitted from this tax treatment when the\nCorporation was solvent, their argument seems more than a little\ndisingenuous. Moreover, as we discuss in Section III.C below,\nwe reject Participants’ characterization of the Plan.\n\n                               23\n\f12.1 of the Plan document,7 which gives the Plan’s\nadministrative committee “sole discretion” over the funding\ndecisions related to the Plan, implies a duty to actually fund\nthe Trust in “good faith”; (2) that the duty of good faith\ncarries an obligation to avoid forfeitures, which, in this case,\ncould only have been accomplished by funding an exclusive\nbenefit trust before the Corporation became insolvent; and\n(3) that the Corporation “pre-approved,” in the Trust\ndocument, an amendment to the Trust that would convert it\nfrom a “rabbi trust,” susceptible to general creditors’ claims,\ninto a secular trust for the exclusive benefit of Plan\nparticipants. Thus, Participants conclude, they have a legal\nright to payment of Plan benefits greater than that of the\nCorporation’s general, unsecured creditors.\n\n        We need not dwell on this argument for long, because\nwe reject its fundamental premise. Although we have\nrecognized that terms of top hat plans that confer discretion to\nplan administrators are subject to the implied duty of good\nfaith, Goldstein v. Johnson & Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773412\"><a href=\"/opinion/773412/gideon-goldstein-md-phd-v-johnson-johnson-retirement-plan-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 448 (3d\nCir. 2001), that duty does not extend as far as Participants\n\n\n  7\n   The full text of paragraph 12.1 is as follows:\n\n       The Employers shall establish the Trust and shall\n       transfer over to the Trust such assets, if any, as\n       the Committee determines, from time to time and\n       in its sole discretion, are appropriate.\n\n                               24\n\fcontend.

For Participants to succeed,\nwe would have to do just that–to hold that the duty requires\nthe Plan’s administrative committee to fund a trust for their\nexclusive benefit. This runs directly afoul of the Plan’s stated\npurpose to remain “unfunded” for ERISA purposes and its\nexpress provision that Participants are not entitled to any\n“legal or equitable right, interest or claim in any property or\nassets of” the Company, and that the Company’s obligation\nunder the Plan “shall be merely that of an unfunded and\nunsecured promise to pay money in the future.” Plan ¶ 13.1.\n\n       Participants urge that at least one court has used the\ndoctrine of “necessary implication” to imply an obligation to\nfund an employee benefit plan that was not expressly\nprovided in the terms of the plan. See Killian v. McCulloch,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132479\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132479/killian-v-mcculloch/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

However, that\ndoctrine is only employed to\n\n       imply an agreement by the parties to a contract to\n       do and perform those things that according to\n       reason and justice they should do in order to\n       carry out the purpose for which the contract was\n\n\n                              25\n\f       made and to refrain from doing anything that\n       would destroy or injure the other party’s right to\n       receive the fruits of the contract.\n\nId. (quoting Somers v. Somers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.

It does not apply\nwhere, as here, the implied agreement would not accomplish\neither of those goals, but would destroy, rather than carry out,\nthe express purpose of the Plan. Here, the Committee, in\nfailing to fund the trust, did nothing to destroy or injure\nParticipants’ rights under the Plan–the Plan granted them only\na limited, unsecured right to future payment.\n\n        Participants would have us employ the implied duty of\ngood faith and the doctrine of necessary implication to expand\ntheir rights under the Plan, not to “carry out the purpose” for\nwhich it was created. To accept Participants’ argument would\nrequire us to depart significantly from our previous decisions\nregarding the scope of the implied duty of good faith, to\nbroaden the doctrine of “necessary implication” and to\ndisregard the plain and unambiguous language of the Plan and\nTrust documents. We cannot, and will not, do so.\n\n                              D.\n\n       Participants’ second claim relies on parol evidence, in\nthe form of an alleged oral representation made by the former\nPresident and CEO of IT Corporation to various Plan\n\n\n                              26\n\fparticipants, to establish that the plan was “funded.” In their\ncomplaint, Participants alleged that the former President and\nCEO assured prospective participants that, in the event of\ninsolvency, the Trust would be funded and they would be paid\nin full.\n\n       Participants argue, first, that terms of the Plan and\nTrust documents that give the Plan’s administrative\ncommittee discretion to fund the Trust create ambiguity as to\nthe Plan’s intended funding status, and, second, that the\nalleged representation should be used to resolve that\nambiguity. See Senior Executive Benefit Plan Participants v.\nNew Valley Corp. (In re New Valley Corp.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721492\"><a href=\"/opinion/721492/20-employee-benefits-cas-1537-pens-plan-guide-p-23922o-in-re-new-valley/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150\n(3d Cir. 1996) (“[O]nce a contract provision is found to be\nambiguous, extrinsic evidence must be considered to clarify\nits meaning.”).\n\n       We disagree. As discussed above, the terms of the\nPlan and Trust documents clearly and unambiguously evince\nthe Corporation’s intent to create an unfunded top hat plan.\nMoreover, as the Bankruptcy Court observed, the oral\nrepresentation alleged by Participants “would add an\nadditional term to the contract regarding funding; it would not\nshed light on the written terms of the Plan.” IT Group, Inc. v.\nBookspan (In re IT Group, Inc.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1532342\"><a href=\"/opinion/1532342/in-re-it-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411 (Bankr.\nD.

Thus, the oral representation does not\n\n\n\n\n                              27\n\fundermine our initial conclusion that the Plan is unfunded,\nand has no place in our analysis.\n\n                             IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the\nBankruptcy and District Courts that Participants’ claims\nshould be dismissed. We will accordingly AFFIRM the\nDistrict Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n                              28\n\f</pre>",
