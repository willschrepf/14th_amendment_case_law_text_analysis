Civil Action No. 04-cv-1944)\n                    District Judge: Honorable Christopher C. Conner\n\n\n                    Submitted Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                                   March 26, 2008\n\n               Before: AMBRO, FUENTES and FISHER, Circuit Judges\n\n                            (Opinion filed: March 28, 2008)\n\n\n                                       OPINION\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      Mike Perez appeals from the order of the U.S. District Court for the Middle\n\nDistrict of Pennsylvania granting summary judgment to the United States. For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we will vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand for\n\ffurther proceedings.\n\n       Perez, a former inmate at FCI-Schuylkill, filed suit under the Federal Tort Claims\n\nAct (“FTCA”) in 2004 alleging that prison officials were negligent when he had an\n\nasthma attack while he was housed in the Segregated Housing Unit (“SHU”). Perez, who\n\nhas a history of asthma, claims that it was very hot in his cell in the early morning hours\n\nof August 16, 2003, and that an additional inmate, who was intoxicated and started\n\nsmoking cigarettes, was added to Perez’ cell. Perez claims that he could not breathe and\n\nthat he vomited due to the extreme heat, lack of ventilation, and close quarters. He\n\nrequested medical attention, but an officer told him no doctor or physician’s assistant was\n\navailable.1 Instead, officers placed him in the shower with the fan on, which, as Perez\n\ntestified at his deposition, “seemed to work.” After an hour, Perez was taken back to his\n\ncell against his wishes. He claims that he still suffered from asthma symptoms at that\n\ntime, that he continued to try to attract the attention of officers on duty, and that the\n\nofficers should have summoned medical personnel to the SHU to help him. He claims to\n\nhave suffered headaches, nausea, weakness and a sore back from his acute attack.\n\n       The physician’s assistant made rounds at about 10 a.m. the morning after Perez’\n\n2:30 a.m. attack, but no interaction with Perez is reflected in the medical records. Perez\n\ntestified at his deposition that he did not see the physician’s assistant until the day after\n\nhis attack (August 17), and that the physician’s assistant told him that the officers should\n\n\n\n   1\n     The United States submitted affidavits of two responding officers who stated that it\ndid not appear as though Perez was having difficulty breathing.\n\n                                               2\n\fhave called the doctor when Perez had the attack.2\n\n       Perez had been prescribed medications by the prison medical staff, an Albuterol\n\ninhaler and Montelukast tablets, and these prescriptions had recently been refilled, but he\n\nclaims that the medication and inhaler did not alleviate his symptoms that night. He\n\nasserts that he needed to be on an Albuterol machine in the medical unit, and that he was\n\nin need of steroids the next day to get himself back to a normal state of breathing, neither\n\nof which he had since he did not receive medical attention. He alleges that he now suffers\n\nfrom psychological problems such as bad dreams and feelings of helplessness, from\n\nsuffering what he feared would be a fatal asthma attack in a cell with unresponsive\n\npersonnel.\n\n       The United States filed a motion for summary judgment and discovery\n\ncommenced. In a reply brief to Perez’ opposition to summary judgment, the United\n\nStates asserted that the injuries claimed by Perez at his deposition–nightmares–did not\n\nconstitute a “prior showing of physical injury” as required under 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2)\n\nand 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) to claim mental or emotional damages. The court agreed and\n\ngranted summary judgment to the United States on that ground. The court denied Perez’\n\nsubsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59(e). Perez appealed.\n\n       We employ a plenary standard of review of the District Court’s order granting\n\n\n\n   2\n    An affidavit by the physician’s assistant states that the records reflect that he did not\nhave any contact with Perez on his rounds on August 16. It does not address August 17.\n\n                                              3\n\fsummary judgment. See Camiolo v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 334 F.3d 345, 354 (3d\n\nCir. 2003). We review the denial of Perez’ motion under Rule 59(e) for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. See Max’s Seafood Café v. Quinteros, 176 F.3d 669, 673 (3d Cir. 1999).\n\n       First, it is unclear why the District Court did not consider whether the immediate\n\nphysical effects from the asthma attack itself would have constituted a “prior showing of\n\nphysical injury” under the statute, but it did not. See Munn v. Toney, 433 F.3d 1087 (8th\n\nCir. 2006) (prisoner’s allegations and testimony of headaches, cramps, nosebleeds, and\n\ndizziness while prison missed prescribed blood pressure screenings sufficient to\n\novercome § 1997e bar); cf. Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342, 1349 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1998) (physical manifestations of emotional injury do not qualify as “prior” physical\n\ninjuries). In its brief, the United States asserts that Perez only identified bad dreams as\n\nhis injuries. While the United States is correct that Perez claims only damages for mental\n\nor emotional distress, it is wrong that Perez never identified other physical injuries that\n\noccurred as a result of the alleged asthma attack. At the deposition, Perez stated that he\n\nwas dizzy, weak, nauseous, and had a headache immediately after the attack, and that he\n\nhad back pain from coughing for a couple of days. (See Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, attached as Exhibit 1, at p. 53-54.) Just because Perez is not\n\nclaiming damages specifically from those physical injuries does not mean that his\n\nallegations of them cannot be considered as a showing of a physical injury for the\n\npurposes of the statute. See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2).\n\n       Moreover, we note that the United States did not raise this defense in the District\n\n                                              4\n\fCourt until its reply brief to Perez’ opposition to summary judgment. Perez had no viable\n\nopportunity to respond to the United States’ argument at that point because the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure do not provide a right to file a sur-reply.3 Even when Perez\n\nattempted to rebut the argument in his motion to alter or amend, the United States\n\ncontended that the argument was improper and that Perez changed his position on his\n\ninjuries because at his deposition Perez only identified bad dreams as his injuries. We do\n\nnot agree; as we pointed out above, Perez stated at his deposition that he suffered from\n\nheadaches, weakness, back pain and nausea immediately after the attack.\n\n       We will vacate the District Court’s order and remand for the court to assess\n\nwhether Perez’ showing of physical injuries is sufficient to meet the statutory criteria of\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). Cf. Mitchell v. Horn, 318 F.3d 523,\n\n536 (3d Cir. 2003) (on appeal from dismissal upon motion to dismiss, remanding for\n\nDistrict Court to decide whether physical injuries met criteria of 28 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)).\n\nWe offer no opinion on the underlying merits of Perez’ claims.4\n\n\n\n\n   3\n     The United States raised the “prior showing of physical injury” defense in only the\nbriefest of terms, and while Perez filed a response to the United States’ reply, he\napparently overlooked or did not respond to this unadorned argument.\n   4\n    We note that Perez filed a post-judgment motion regarding fees in the District Court,\nwhich remains outstanding.\n\n                                              5\n\f",

We do\n\nnot agree; as we pointed out above, Perez stated at his deposition that he suffered from\n\nheadaches, weakness, back pain and nausea immediately after the attack.\n\n       We will vacate the District Court’s order and remand for the court to assess\n\nwhether Perez’ showing of physical injuries is sufficient to meet the statutory criteria of\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).
