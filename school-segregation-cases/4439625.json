See Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(h) (West Supp. 2014). The trial court sentenced the\n\nAppellant to death on November 16, 2013 for the capital murder of Shania Gray.\n\nThe Appellant filed his brief on February 27, 2015.         He presents forty-eight\n\nallegations of reversible error.\n\n                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n                                     Guilt/Innocence\n\n                                   State’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      In September 2010, fourteen year-old Shania Gray was a freshman in high\n\nschool and had just started her first job babysitting Jennifer Dibrell‘s three young\n\nchildren. (RR60: 75–77). The Appellant was the father of Jennifer‘s youngest\n\nchild, Dezire. (RR60: 75–77, 79).          After several months of babysitting, the\n\nAppellant suggested they give Shania a Blackberry cell phone as payment. (RR60:\n\n80; SX: 235).\n\n      One night in early April 2011, Shania‘s mother Sherry noticed a text\n\nmessage on Shania‘s phone from ―Wish.‖ (RR60: 81). Sherry, who had met the\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fAppellant once on Christmas, knew that he went by that nickname. (RR60: 75, 78–\n\n79, 81). Sherry took the phone and saw a message asking Shania why she was no\n\nlonger coming over to babysit. (RR60: 81, 87). The next message Sherry saw said:\n\n―I want you. I just can‘t have you right now.‖ (RR60: 87). When Sherry asked\n\nShania about the messages, she became visibly upset and began to cry. (RR60: 88).\n\n      Sherry took Shania to Jennifer‘s house to discuss the messages, but Jennifer\n\ndid not seem surprised by the messages; in fact, she was nonchalant about the\n\nentire situation. (RR60: 88–89). Sherry asked Jennifer to call the Appellant on the\n\nphone. (RR60: 89). The Appellant would not speak with Sherry, but told Jennifer\n\nto have her call him the following day after work. (RR60: 89).\n\n      Shania was still upset and crying on the drive home. (RR60: 91). Sherry\n\ndecided to take Shania to her grandmother‘s house, two blocks away, to spend the\n\nnight. (RR60: 91). Sherry wanted an opportunity to talk to her husband Marvin\n\nabout what course of action they should take. (RR60: 91–92).\n\n      The following morning, Sherry sent the Appellant a text message informing\n\nhim that they were going to call the police regarding the inappropriate text\n\nmessages between him and Shania. (RR60: 92). The Appellant responded and\n\nclaimed Shania was lying. (RR60: 92). Later that day, Shirley Brown, the mother\n\nof one of Shania‘s friends, brought Shania home and asked to talk to Sherry.\n\n(RR60: 98–101). Shania had told Shirley that the Appellant had sexually assaulted\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fher. (RR60: 98–99, 101). That evening, Sherry‘s husband called the Appellant.\n\n(RR60: 93). The Appellant claimed that he did not know the text messages were\n\nfrom Shania and had responded to them as a joke. (RR60: 93–94).\n\n      At that point, Sherry contacted Officer Johnny Ivy, the Student Resource\n\nOfficer (―SRO‖), at Shania‘s high school. (RR60: 95). Sherry told Officer Ivy that\n\nthe father of the children that Shania had been babysitting was sending her\n\ninappropriate text messages. (RR60: 96).      Officer Ivy contacted the Mesquite\n\nPolice Department on Sherry‘s behalf, and an officer arrived at their home a few\n\nhours later. (RR60: 97). The officer spoke to Shania and took a general statement.\n\n(RR60: 105–06). Shania then met with Detective Snyder at the Mesquite Police\n\nDepartment. (RR60: 105–07). Snyder scheduled an appointment for Shania at the\n\nDallas Children‘s Advocacy Center (―DCAC‖). (RR60: 105–07). Sherry took\n\nShania for a forensic interview and then to Children‘s Medical Center for a\n\nREACH examination. (RR60: 107; SX: 239).            Sherry was later contacted by\n\nDetective Snyder and informed that the Appellant had been indicted on four counts\n\nof sexual assault of a child. (RR60: 108; SX: 9, 10, 11, 12).\n\n      In September 2012, Shania transferred to Hebron High School in Carrollton.\n\n(RR60: 112–13). Shania did not have a driver‘s license, so Sherry drove her to and\n\nfrom school because they were still living in Mesquite. (RR60: 113–14). Sherry\n\nand Shania would communicate by text message during the day. (RR60: 114–15).\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fOn her second day of school, September 6, 2012, Shania sent Sherry a text\n\nmessage telling her that she was going to stay after school for physics tutoring.\n\n(RR60: 116–17, 121).\n\n      Sherry arrived to pick Shania up at approximately 4:05pm. (RR60: 116,\n\n121). When Sherry called Shania to let her know she was at the school, Shania\n\ntold her that the tutoring session was wrapping up and she would be out in a few\n\nminutes. (RR60: 117). Sherry reminded Shania that they had choir practice that\n\nevening. (RR60: 117). By 4:20pm, Sherry began to text Shania, but received no\n\nresponse. (RR60: 118). After thirty minutes passed, Sherry barraged Shania with\n\ncalls, but her phone went straight to voice mail. (RR60: 118–19).\n\n      Sherry decided to go inside the school to look for Shania, but the door to the\n\nphysics classroom was locked and the lights were off. (RR60: 121). Sherry then\n\nchecked the gymnasium and spoke with a coach who was able to contact Shania‘s\n\nphysics teacher, Christine Cone. (RR60: 122, 150–53). Cone confirmed that Shania\n\ncame to her class for tutoring that afternoon, but left at approximately 4:00pm after\n\nshe received a phone call from her Sherry. (RR60: 150–54). Shania told Cone that\n\nshe ―had to hurry and go; my mom‘s waiting on me.‖ (RR60: 155). This was the\n\nlast time Shania was seen alive. (RR61: 228). The search for Shania continued\n\nuntil nearly midnight to no avail. (RR60: 123–30).\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f      The next morning, September 7, 2012, Sherry went back to the school and\n\nspoke with SRO Forest Langston. (RR60: 131, 172–75).        Langston contacted\n\nMesquite Horn High School, Shania‘s previous school, and learned that Shania\n\nwas the named victim in four sexual assault cases currently pending against the\n\nAppellant. (RR60: 131, 136–37, 179–81). Langston pulled the phone records for\n\nShania‘s phone and discovered that she had been in contact with someone with a\n\n903-603-8786 number around the time she disappeared. (RR60: 175–76).\n\nLangston called the number; however, no one answered and the voice mail was not\n\nset up. (RR60: 176).   Langston learned that the phone was a prepaid phone\n\npurchased at Walmart and had no subscriber information. (RR60: 177).\n\n      Langston also checked the school‘s surveillance video and found footage of\n\nShania exiting the south side of the building. (RR60: 185–89; SX: 16). She\n\nappeared to have a cell phone in her hand. (RR60: 189; SX: 16). The video also\n\nshowed a gray Dodge Stratus parked on the south side of the building. (RR60:\n\n186–89; SX: 16).\n\n      At this point, Detective Dena Williams with the Carrollton Police\n\nDepartment became involved in the case. (RR60: 132–33). Williams obtained the\n\ncall records for the 903-603-8786 number based on exigent circumstances. (RR61:\n\n58). The 903 number had only been in contact with four other numbers, so\n\nWilliams called each of the numbers and left a message. (RR61: 220–21).\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fShakeema Morsley returned the detective‘s call and informed her that she believed\n\nthat the Appellant was the person contacting her from the 903 number. (RR61:\n\n222). Morsley did not have the Appellant‘s phone number, but she did have a\n\nnumber for his wife, Jawanna Arrington. (RR61: 223).\n\n      Williams called Jawanna and was able to speak to with her and the\n\nAppellant. (RR61: 223). Williams told them that she was investigating a missing\n\nchild case and asked them about the 903 number. (RR61: 224). Both denied\n\nknowing anything about the 903 number. (RR61: 224–25). Jawanna owned a 2005\n\ngray Dodge Stratus that was registered to an address in Irving. (RR60: 218–20).\n\n      Carrollton Police Detectives Perritt and Cook drove to the address that\n\nJawanna‘s 2005 gray Dodge Stratus was registered to in Irving while Williams was\n\non the phone with the Appellant. (RR61: 218–21, 225–26). The detectives made\n\ncontact with the Appellant when he stepped outside of his apartment to take out\n\nsome trash. (RR61: 218–21, 225–26). The detectives were able to confirm that\n\nneither Shania nor any evidence of a crime scene were present at the Appellant‘s\n\napartment. (RR61: 226). The Appellant agreed to come to the police department to\n\ntalk to Detective Williams. (RR61: 224, 226–27). The Appellant drove himself\n\nand his wife in their own vehicle. (RR61: 224, 226–27).\n\n      By the time the Appellant arrived at the Carrollton Police Department it was\n\n1:48am on Saturday September 8, 2012. (RR61: 227).           In the first of four\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\finterviews with the police, the Appellant denied any involvement in Shania‘s\n\ndisappearance. (RR63: 25–26; SX: 57, 57C). The Appellant insisted that he was\n\ninnocent of the sexual assault charges and told Williams that Shania had sent him\n\nsome text messages admitting that she lied about the assaults because her mother\n\nmade her. (SX: 57, 57C).         The Appellant offered to show Williams the text\n\nmessages on his T-Mobile smart phone1. (RR62: 26–27). At the time of this\n\ninterview, Detective Williams did not have any data from the cell phone towers\n\nand did not know that the text messages that the Appellant wanted to show her\n\nwere fake. (RR62: 25–26, 30–32).            At the conclusion of the interview, the\n\nAppellant was placed under arrest for outstanding traffic warrants from Balch\n\nSprings and was also placed on a forty-eight hour investigative hold. (RR62: 39–\n\n41; SX: 57, 57C).\n\n       Detective Jeremy Chevallier conducted the second interview with the\n\nAppellant, which the Appellant initiated. (RR62: 39–41, 51; SX: 57, 57B). He told\n\nChevallier he wanted to talk to him because he forgot to tell Detective Williams\n\nthat he had recorded conversations between himself and Shania. (SX: 57, 57B).\n\nThe Appellant claimed that he recorded the conversations because he felt like his\n\ncourt-appointed attorney was not going to do a good job. (SX: 57, 57B). The\n\nAppellant told Chevallier that the recordings contained statements from Shania that\n\n1\n The record reflects the number for the Appellant‘s T-Mobile phone is 972-302-1976. (SX: 50,\n51, 52).\n\n\n                                             7\n\fcontradicted what she told the police. (SX: 57, 57B). The Appellant continued to\n\ndeny any involvement in Shania‘s disappearance. (SX: 57, 57B).\n\n       Approximately an hour and a half after his second interview, Chevallier was\n\nnotified that the Appellant wanted to speak with him again. (RR62: 71). During\n\nthis third interview, the Appellant admitted that the phone with the 903 number\n\nwas his and he admitted to killing Shania. (SX: 57, 19A). The Appellant confessed\n\nto taking Shania to a park off of Interstate 635, shooting her twice, and then putting\n\nhis foot on her neck until she stopped breathing. (SX: 57, 19A). He then rolled her\n\nbody into the Trinity River and left the park. (SX: 57; 19A). During the interview,\n\nShania‘s body was found floating face-down in the Trinity River in a secluded\n\nsection of Sam Houston Trail Park near the intersection of Interstate 635 and the\n\nGeorge Bush Tollway. (RR61: 108–17; RR62: 73; SX: 57, 19A). At the end of the\n\ninterview, the Appellant agreed to take Chevallier to the crime scene. (RR62: 75,\n\n79).\n\n       Shania‘s body was in the process of being recovered when they arrived.\n\n(RR62: 78). Crime scene investigators found a backpack containing Shania‘s\n\nidentification card and other papers identifying her near her body. (RR63: 130; SX:\n\n113, 114, 115). The Appellant took police to two ponds where he had disposed of\n\nevidence. From these ponds, police recovered a Diamondback .380 handgun,\n\nwhich the Appellant identified as the gun he used to shoot Shania, Shania‘s iPhone,\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fand the Appellant‘s muddy shoes. (RR62: 79, 90–92; RR63: 131, 133, 180–81;\n\nSX: 58, 221).\n\n      On September 9, 2012, Detective Williams and Detective Grigg were\n\nnotified that the Appellant wanted to talk to them again. (RR62: 117). They went\n\nto the jail and met with him for his fourth interview. (RR62: 117–18; RR63: 20;\n\nSX: 72, 72A). During the interview, the Appellant talked about the sexual assault\n\ncharges and again told Williams about the text messages Shania sent him. (RR63:\n\n26). The Appellant claimed that when Shania got in the car just prior to her\n\nmurder, she told him: ―I‘m going to tell the truth.       You‘re right, this never\n\nhappened. It was my mama that made me do it.‖ (RR63: 26).\n\n      The autopsy revealed that Shania had been shot twice. (RR63: 261–63).\n\nOne of the gunshot wounds entered the back of her right shoulder, traveled through\n\nthe muscles of her shoulder and neck, and exited through the right side of her neck.\n\n(RR63: 264). The second gunshot wound entered the lower left side of Shania‘s\n\nback and ended up in the iliopsoas muscle of her right hip. (RR63: 264). The\n\nbullet was recovered from her body. (RR63: 264). Neither bullet struck any major\n\nblood vessels or organs. (RR63: 264). Shania had another injury, to her throat, that\n\nwas consistent with asphyxia. (RR63: 265).        Though decomposition made it\n\ndifficult to see the injury to Shania‘s neck, it was clear that the thyroid cartilage\n\nthat makes up the voice box was fractured, an injury consistent with pressure from\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fa foot or knee being applied to the area. (RR63: 265–66). The medical examiner\n\ntestified that the cause of death was homicidal violence including gunshot wound\n\nand asphyxia, with the asphyxia including both the neck compressions and possible\n\ndrowning. (RR63: 278–79).\n\n         The Diamondback .380 handgun, two cartridge cases, and two bullets were\n\nsent to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner‘s Crime Lab for examination.\n\n(RR62: 95–96). The two cartridge cases and one of the bullets were recovered\n\nfrom the crime scene, and the second bullet was recovered during Shania‘s\n\nautopsy. The crime lab determined that the cartridges and the bullets were fired by\n\nthe handgun recovered from the pond. (RR62: 104)\n\n         Data from T-Mobile and AT&T was also used to track the movement of the\n\nAppellant and Shania during her disappearance. The data showed that on the\n\nevening of September 5, 2012, at approximately 10:11pm, the Appellant‘s phone2\n\nhit off of a cell tower near Shania‘s house. (RR61: 197–98; SX: 56). At that time,\n\nShania‘s phone was not hitting off of the tower near her home, indicating that she\n\nwas not there. (RR61: 195–96).            Over the next several hours, multiple text\n\nmessages and calls were exchanged between the numbers. (RR61: 195–99; SX:\n\n56). By the end of the conversations, at approximately midnight, the Appellant‘s\n\n\n\n\n2\n    This examination used the 903-603-8786 throwaway phone. (RR61: 188–91).\n\n\n                                              10\n\fcell phone was hitting off of a tower near his apartment, and Shania‘s cell phone\n\nwas hitting off of a cell phone tower near her home. (RR61: 197–98; SX: 56).\n\n      At approximately 12:36pm on September 6, 2012, the Appellant‘s cell\n\nphone hit off of a cell tower near Shakeema Morsley‘s apartment. (RR61: 201).\n\nFrom 3:30pm until approximately 4:30pm, the Appellant and Shania‘s cell phones\n\nwere both hitting off of a cell tower near Hebron High School. (RR61: 201–04).\n\nAt approximately 5:15pm, Shania‘s phone hit off of a cell tower near the\n\nAppellant‘s apartment, and shortly thereafter, was no longer in contact with the\n\nnetwork. (RR61: 204–05).     Additionally, cell phone records showed that the\n\nAppellant received two calls to his 972-302-1976 smart phone at approximately\n\n4:01pm on September 6, 2012. (RR61: 178; SX: 50, 51, 52). The calls hit off of a\n\ncell tower located near Hebron High School. (RR61: 178–79; SX: 50, 51, 52).\n\n      Considerable evidence was also recovered from the Appellant‘s T-Mobile\n\nsmart phone (972-302-1976). Jeff Shaffer, a Special Agent with the Dallas Field\n\nOffice of the Secret Service, conducted a forensic examination of the phone.\n\n(RR60: 229, 231; SX: 18). Shaffer‘s forensic examination revealed:\n\n    A deleted contact named ―throwaway‖ with a cell phone number 903-603-\n     8786. (RR60: 247–48; SX: 20).\n\n    A picture of Shania downloaded onto the phone on July 13, 2012. (RR60:\n     249–50; SX: 20).\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f       Multiple Google searches:\n\n             o On August 28, 2012 at 5:26pm, the Appellant searched for gun shows\n               in Dallas. (RR60: 252–53; SX: 20).\n\n             o On August 29, 2012, the Appellant conducted searches for a\n               Diamondback .380 handgun and its price. (RR60: 254–55; SX: 20).\n\n             o On September 6, 2012 at 1:53pm, the Appellant searched for Hebron\n               High School. (RR60: 257; SX: 20).\n\n       On August 30, 2012, the Appellant placed multiple calls to a person named\n        Chris.3 (RR60: 254).\n\n       A map search for the intersection of I-635 and Highway 161, the location of\n        Sam Houston Trail Park, where Shania‘s body was found. (RR60: 264; SX:\n        21).\n\n       Six text messages were also recovered from the Appellant‘s phone. (RR60:\n        266). The messages all appeared to be from the number 214-709-6861,\n        Shania‘s cell phone number. (RR60: 266; SX: 20).\n\n             o The first message, sent on August 27, 2012 at 8:25pm4, stated: ―Ar3 u\n               still mad @ m3?‖ (RR60: 266–68; SX: 20).\n\n             o The second message, sent at 8:35pm, stated: ―Sorry I li3d on u but my\n               momma mad3 m3 do it. If we go to court ima t3ll th3m u never\n               touched me. My my momma go b3 mad @ m3 but fuck that bitch I\n               can‘t stand her no ways. Please 4give me.‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n             o The third message, sent at 9:40pm, said: ―Is this mr. Wish#.‖ (RR60:\n               267–68; SX: 20).\n\n             o The fourth message, sent on August 28, 2012 at 7:50pm, said only:\n               ―Mr. Wish?‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n3\n The trial testimony showed that the Appellant bought a gun from a man named Christopher\nAllen on August 30, 2012. (RR63: 131).\n4\n    All times were in Coordinated Universal Time, or ―UTC‖. (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n\n                                               12\n\f            o The fifth message, sent at 7:53pm, said: ―I beli3v3 if I t3ll the truth\n              sh3 will punish m3 for a long tim3 and I want b3 able to play\n              basketball.‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n            o The final message, sent at 8:04pm, said: ―Pl3as3 r3spond back if this\n              is still your numb3r.‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n      The timeline recovered from the phone showed that on August 27, 2012 at\n\n7:55pm UTC, an application called ―Fake Call & SMS & Call Log‖ was installed\n\non the phone. (RR60: 268; SX: 42, 43). All of the messages and calls from number\n\n214-709-6861 came after the installation of the fake SMS and call log application.\n\n(RR60: 270–71). The cell phone records for the two numbers did not show any\n\ncalls or text messages that corresponded with those occurring after the installation\n\nof the fake SMS and call log application. (RR60: 277–78).\n\n      Because the six text messages appearing to come from Shania were\n\nsuspicious, additional forensic examination was conducted on the Appellant‘s\n\nphone by Andrew Hoog, an expert in smart phone data recovery. (RR61: 130–32).\n\nHoog was able to determine that the six text messages that appeared to be sent\n\nfrom Shania‘s cell phone were fake and had been created by the fake SMS and call\n\nlog application. (RR61: 150). Hoog‘s examination of the Appellant‘s phone also\n\nrevealed:\n\n    A calendar entry for a July 24, 2012 court date. (RR61: 151).\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f    Google searches for:\n\n         o ―Can you record a person without them knowing in Texas?‖ and ―Can\n           you record a person by phone without them knowing in Texas?‖ on\n           July 18, 2012. (RR61: 152–53).\n\n         o ―Best way to get off of a sexual assault charge.‖ and ―With no proof\n           that you did the murder, can you still be held in jail?‖ at 12:55pm the\n           same day. (RR61: 154).\n\n         o ―Can you voice-record a minor over the phone in Texas?‖ and ―Can\n           tape-record conversation with a person story changing and get you off\n           a charge?‖ on July 19, 2012. (RR61: 154–55).\n\n         o ―Can tape-recorded conversation be used in court?‖ and ―Can tape-\n           recorded conversation against a minor?‖ on July 23, 2012. (RR61:\n           155).\n\n    Logins to Facebook accounts for Jazmine Brown and Domee Elkins Brown.\n     (RR61: 157–61). While logged in as Jazmine, the Appellant sent a friend\n     request to Shania. (RR61: 160–61; SX: 48).\n\n    An Intellius search for Shania Gray in Texas. (RR61: 162).\n\n       An hour-long recorded conversation was also recovered from the phone.\n\n(RR60: 236).    In the recording, the Appellant, using the false identity ―D,‖\n\nquestioned Shania at length about the sexual assaults. (RR61: 92; SX: 19, 19B).\n\nHe also told Shania to tell the prosecutors that she lied about the sexual assault\n\ncharges and that she would not get in trouble because she was a minor. (SX; 19,\n\n19B). The Appellant also told her: ―[I]f he turn around and go to the pen and get\n\nout, he might have a grudge towards you, and you know, say, come after you . . .\n\nwhen he get out of jail.‖ (SX: 19, 19B).\n\n\n                                           14\n\f                              Defense Case-in-Chief\n\n       Detective Brandon Snyder, with the Mesquite Police Department, was the\n\nlead detective investigating the sexual assault charges against the Appellant.\n\n(RR64: 27–28).      Snyder testified that Shania‘s mother discovered the text\n\nmessages between the Appellant and Shania on April 7, 2011. (RR64: 31). The\n\nfamily did not contact the police department and make a report until April 14,\n\n2011. (RR64: 31). Snyder was assigned to the case on April 15, 2011. (RR64: 29).\n\nSnyder was informed that the Appellant had contacted the police department on\n\nApril 11, 2015, in order to determine if a report had been made about him. (RR64:\n\n30).\n\n       Once Snyder was assigned to the case, he scheduled a forensic interview for\n\nShania at the DCAC on April 21, 2011. (RR64: 31–32). Snyder was present when\n\nCaitlin Clevenger conducted the interview. (RR64: 88). In the interview, when\n\nClevenger asked Shania if ―anything like this had ever happened before,‖ Shania\n\ntold Clevenger ―no.‖ (RR64: 107–08; SX: 239). After the forensic interview,\n\nSnyder interviewed Sherry, who gave him consent to process Shania‘s cell phone\n\nso that he could access the text messages. (RR64: 32).\n\n       The cell phone was processed on April 25, 2011. (RR64: 33). One of the\n\ncontacts in Shania‘s Blackberry was for ―Wish,‖ with the number 972-302-1976.\n\n(RR64: 74–75). Shania also had his birthday listed on her calendar. (RR64: 75).\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      The April 7, 2011 string of text messages between the Appellant and Shania\n\nwas recovered. (RR64: 76; SX: 235). The first message from the Appellant said:\n\n―Wow ok then goodbye,‖ and was sent at 21:50:30. (RR64: 76; SX; 235). Shania\n\nresponded: ―Imm not saynn goodbye just yet…‖ at 21:50:56. (RR64: 76; SX: 235).\n\nThe Appellant responded: ―Thats foul so im pose to sit around an wait! Man\n\nwhateva,‖ at 21:51:47. (RR64: 76; SX: 235). Shania replied: ―Nope now yhu gettn\n\nmad for wahh!!!!!! Yhu got 2 for the price if one wahh yhu complainin\n\nfor…….tryna have yhur cake nd eat it too,‖ at 21:53:19. (RR64: 76; SX: 235). The\n\nAppellant responded: ―Just want u but cant fully have u yet,‖ at 21:54:17. (RR64:\n\n77; SX: 235). Snyder testified that the text exchange between Shania and the\n\nAppellant looked like a conversation between individuals in an intimate\n\nrelationship with one another. (RR64: 113–14).\n\n      The Appellant denied the allegations when Snyder interviewed him. (RR64:\n\n44; DX: 2). He told Snyder that he thought Shania had a crush on him. (RR64: 50;\n\nDX: 2). The Appellant also said that Shania would invite boys over while she was\n\nbabysitting. (RR64: 51; DX: 2). The Appellant told Snyder that he deleted the text\n\nmessages. (RR64: 63; DX: 2). He told Snyder that he was ―just playing around,‖\n\nand was just explaining to Shania that she was too young and he could not see her.\n\n(RR64: 77; DX: 2). Snyder did not take the Appellant‘s phone. (RR64: 63; DX:\n\n2).\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f      Following his interview with the Appellant, Snyder interviewed the outcry\n\nwitnesses. (RR64: 53). Snyder testified that one of the outcry witnesses told him\n\nthat Shania had changed her story. (RR64: 40). He did not interview the children\n\nthat Shania was babysitting. (RR64: 53). Snyder testified that Shania told him the\n\nchildren were sent to clean their room or were outside when he assaulted her.\n\n(RR64: 54). Snyder did not interview Jennifer, the children‘s mother, because she\n\nwas not present when the assaults occurred. (RR64: 55). Snyder did not visit the\n\nlocation of the assaults. (RR64: 57).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he killed Shania because she ruined his life.\n\n(RR64: 136). According to the Appellant, he lost everything because she lied\n\nabout the sexual assaults. (RR64: 136). The Appellant characterized the time prior\n\nto the allegations as ―happy,‖ but claimed that ―Shania‘s lies‖ changed everything.\n\n(RR64: 145). The Appellant had just married Jawanna and he had just been\n\npromoted at Dr. Pepper, despite having only been there for three or four months.\n\n(RR64: 142–44).\n\n      The Appellant was unable to return to Dr. Pepper after his arrest for the\n\nsexual assault charges because he could no longer pass a background check and he\n\nwas forced to file for unemployment. (RR64: 145–49). The Appellant testified that\n\nhis wife looked at him differently because he was unable to provide for his family;\n\nthey were no longer able to go to the movies, go out to eat or go shopping. (RR64:\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f148, 151). When they argued, Jawanna would tell the Appellant that everything\n\nwas on her shoulders because she was the sole provider. (RR64: 152).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he met Shania for the first time on Christmas\n\n2010. (RR64: 174–75). He would see her when he went to visit Jennifer‘s kids,\n\nwhich was usually about four times a week. (RR64: 187). The Appellant testified\n\nthat Shania had a nice personality and made him laugh. (RR64: 182–83). The two\n\nformed a bond and he started to care for her like a sister. (RR64: 183). In fact,\n\nShania would confide in him. (RR64: 190). The Appellant estimated that he spent\n\nsix or seven hours a week with her. (RR64: 190–91). However, he denied ever\n\nbeing alone with her. (RR64: 193). The Appellant denied having sex or any sexual\n\ncontact with her and also denied swatting or grabbing her butt. (RR64: 183).\n\n      The Appellant testified that when he first received text messages from\n\nShania, he did not know that they were from her. (RR64: 207). He claimed that\n\nShania asked him whether or not he loved Jawanna, and he told her that he did,\n\nwhich was why he was going to marry her. (RR64: 209–10). The Appellant\n\nclaimed that Shania then told him that she wished she had not gotten her feelings\n\ninvolved because she wanted him. (RR64: 210). It was then that he sent her the\n\ntext messages telling her he could not have her ―like that‖ because she was too\n\nyoung. (RR64: 212). The Appellant claimed that the text message he sent her\n\nstating: ―Wow ok then gudbye,‖ and ―That‘s foul so im pose to sit around an wait!\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fMan whateva‖ were referring to how long it was taking Shania to respond to his\n\nprevious message5. (RR64: 213; SX: 235).\n\n         The Appellant testified that he knew Shania had a crush on him because she\n\nhad flirted with him on previous occasions. (RR64: 212). He denied flirting with\n\nher but characterized himself as a ―charmer.‖ (RR64: 213). The Appellant did not\n\nwant to hurt her feelings so he was trying to ―let her down easily.‖ (RR64: 214).\n\nAppellant explained that the text: ―Nope now yhu gettn mad for wahh!!!!!! Yhu\n\ngot 2 for the price if one wahh yhu complainin for…….tryna have yhur cake nd eat\n\nit too,‖ was referring to him having sex with Jennifer after he was engaged to\n\nJawanna. (RR64: 215–16; SX: 235). The Appellant claimed that Jennifer told\n\nShania about the encounter. (RR64: 217).\n\n         The Appellant hired Tom Cox to represent him on the sexual assault charges\n\nand agreed to pay him $15,000, $6,000 coming from the Appellant‘s car, which he\n\nsigned over to Cox. (RR64: 158–59). The Appellant agreed to a payment plan to\n\npay the remaining $9,000. (RR64: 158–59). He tried to pay the remainder of the\n\nfee using his unemployment benefits, but he only received $275 to $300 every two\n\nweeks. (RR64: 158–59). In the end, he was only able to pay Cox $4,600 in cash\n\nbecause his unemployment benefits ran out. (RR64: 161–62). According to the\n\nAppellant, Cox never hired an investigator to look into the charges and never set\n\n5\n    Cell phone records show that less than one minute passed between the texts. (SX: 235).\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fhis cases for trial. (RR64: 162, 165). However, Cox did tell him that Shania had\n\ntrichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease. (RR64: 166).\n\n      When the Appellant told Cox he could no longer pay him, Cox asked the\n\ncourt to withdraw from the case. (RR64: 163–64).           The court granted the\n\nwithdrawal and appointed Hugo Aguilar to represent him in August 2012. (RR64:\n\n171). The Appellant testified that he never met with Aguilar aside from when he\n\nwas first appointed and Aguilar never returned his phone calls. (RR64: 172). The\n\nAppellant became concerned that Aguilar was not going to help him, so he began\n\nhis own investigation. (RR65: 21).\n\n      First, he began to look for anything online that could be used to attack\n\nShania‘s character. (RR65: 22). The Appellant went to Shania‘s Facebook page,\n\nbut it was private. (RR65: 22). The Appellant created a fake Facebook profile\n\nunder the name Jazmine Brown and tried to communicate with Shania. (RR65: 23).\n\nShania, however, did not accept his friend request. (RR65: 24).\n\n      Next, the Appellant contacted his nephew Domee Elkins for access to his\n\nFacebook page. (RR65: 24). The Appellant chose Elkins because he was young\n\nand handsome. (RR65: 24). The Appellant sent Shania a friend request under\n\nElkins‘ profile and she accepted. (RR65: 24). He was then able to access her\n\nprofile and found her phone number. (RR65: 25). He decided to contact her by\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\ftext message. (RR65: 25). The Appellant bought a ―throwaway‖ phone from\n\nWalmart to contact Shania. (RR65: 26).\n\n      That night, the Appellant contacted Shania claiming to be ―D,‖ a relative of\n\nElkins. (RR65: 27, 34). The Appellant had looked on Facebook for a profile he\n\ncould claim was ―D‘s‖ and decided to use Artis Powell‘s. (RR65: 27, 35). The\n\nAppellant told Shania his middle name was Dwayne, so he went by ―D.‖ (RR65:\n\n34). He told Shania if she wanted to see what he looked like, she should visit\n\nPowell‘s Facebook page. (RR65: 27). The Appellant had already sent Powell a\n\nmessage from the Jazmine Brown Facebook page warning Powell not to respond to\n\nany messages from Shania because she was underage. (RR65: 26–27).\n\n      Two or three days after the Appellant first sent Shania a text message, she\n\ncalled him. (RR65: 30). At first, the Appellant thought Shania had figured out\n\nwhat was going on, but then she sent him a text message telling him she wanted to\n\ntalk. (RR65: 30). The Appellant went down to his car and called her back on the\n\nthrowaway phone. (RR65: 30). He placed the call on speakerphone and recorded it\n\nusing his smart phone. (RR65: 30). The Appellant testified that he recorded seven\n\nof their conversations. (RR65: 30). The Appellant admitted that there was not\n\nmuch on two or three of the recordings. (RR65: 30–31).\n\n      The Appellant felt good about his investigation because in one of the\n\nrecordings, Shania said there were only three sexual assaults instead of four, and\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fshe also stated that one of the assaults occurred in the bedroom of his apartment.\n\n(RR65: 32; SX: 19, 19B). The Appellant testified that this contradicted what she\n\nsaid in the DCAC video because she said it happened in the bathroom at his\n\napartment. (RR65: 31–32; SX: 19, 19B, 239). The Appellant said that the other\n\nrecording also proved her bad character because she talked about having sex.\n\n(RR65: 32). The Appellant made all of the recordings within a week of having\n\nfirst contacted her. (RR65: 33).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he took the recordings to his attorney, who was\n\n―kind of iffy‖ about them. (RR65: 35). He then drove to Mesquite and was going\n\nto play the recordings for Sherry and Marvin, but began to worry that they would\n\nclaim he forced his way into their house. (RR65: 35–37). The Appellant was on\n\nthe phone with his son Trey‘s mother Linda at the time, and she told him about an\n\napplication that could be downloaded and used to make fake text messages. (RR65:\n\n37). The Appellant decided that the fake text messages would give him the ―extra\n\npush‖ to prove his point and get the prosecutor to dismiss the case. (RR65: 39).\n\nThe Appellant admitted that he created the fake text messages. (RR65: 40–41). He\n\nalso admitted that he bought a gun from Linda‘s brother, Christopher Allen.\n\n(RR65: 43).\n\n      The Appellant testified he went to the James‘ house on September 5, 2012,\n\nwith the gun. (RR65: 38, 48). He contemplated killing the entire family, but when\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\fhe thought about Shania‘s younger brother, who was completely innocent, he got\n\nback in his car and left. (RR65: 38, 48). The Appellant admitted to sitting in his\n\ncar outside of their house for thirty to forty-five minutes, just thinking. (RR65: 49).\n\n      On September 6, 2012, ―D‖ received a text message from Shania wanting to\n\nmeet. (RR65: 54). Shania told him that she was at Hebron High School. (RR65:\n\n54). The Appellant testified that he wanted to meet with Shania to ―tell her how\n\nshe ruined my life. How . . . the small lie she told took everything from me.‖\n\n(RR65: 55).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he was going to meet Shania when she was\n\nsupposed to be in tutoring. (RR65: 57). Shania told him to park by the tennis\n\ncourt. (RR65: 57). The Appellant denied having the gun with him while he was\n\nstanding outside waiting for her; instead, he claimed he left it in his car. (RR65:\n\n59–60). When Shania came out of the door, she called his cell phone and asked if\n\nthat was him with the hat on his head. (RR65: 58–59). The Appellant answered\n\naffirmatively and turned toward her. (RR65: 59). Shania froze when she saw him\n\nand said: ―Oh, shit.‖ (RR65: 59).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he told Shania he was not going to hurt her and\n\njust wanted to talk to her. (RR65: 59). He claimed that Shania relaxed and walked\n\nwith him to the car. (RR65: 60–61). The Appellant opened the passenger door for\n\nher and she got in. (RR65: 61). He denied forcing her to get in the car or using the\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fgun. (RR65: 62). However, the Appellant admitted that Shania saw the gun.\n\n(RR65: 67). He testified that he had placed the gun in the door handle, but when\n\nhe began to drive, it would slide around, so he placed the gun in his lap between\n\nhis legs. (RR65: 67).\n\n      The Appellant drove to Sam Houston Trail Park, where he and his wife had\n\nwalked the Campion Trail two or three months earlier. (RR65: 67–69). During the\n\ndrive he thought about his childhood and how his grandfather and mentally\n\nretarded brother had raped him. (RR65: 72). He also thought about his daughter\n\nand the holes in her shoes. (RR65: 72). He told Shania that he had been on her\n\nFacebook page and saw pictures of her enjoying herself while her lies had ruined\n\nhis life. (RR65: 71). He told her he had to give his Ford Mustang to a lawyer and\n\nhe could not provide for his kids. (RR65: 66). He also told her that he had been\n\noutside of her house the night before and was going to kill everyone inside. (RR65:\n\n66). The Appellant testified that he started to cry, and Shania reached up and\n\nplaced her hand on his and told him she was sorry. (RR65: 66–67).\n\n      When they arrived at the park, they sat in silence for a few minutes. (RR65:\n\n70–71). The Appellant told her that he was in pain and she should be in pain too.\n\n(RR65: 71). Shania told him that her life had not been happy. (RR65: 73). She\n\ntold him she had an abortion. (RR65: 73). The Appellant testified that, as soon as\n\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\fshe said that, he told her to get out of the car and leave her cell phone on the\n\ndashboard. (RR65: 73).\n\n      They walked to the sidewalk and down a slope towards the Trinity River.\n\n(RR65: 73–74). The Appellant testified that he told Shania to go down the slope\n\nand wait approximately ten minutes, and then she could come back up and go call\n\nher mother. (RR65: 74). The Appellant told her that he did not care what she told\n\nher mother, but she could not tell her that he had kidnapped her because she got in\n\nthe car willingly. (RR65: 74).\n\n      When Shania was about halfway down the slope, he turned and started to\n\nwalk away, but stopped, pulled the gun out of his pocket, turned around, and shot\n\nShania in the back. (RR65: 75). Shania lost her balance and fell into the water.\n\n(RR65: 76). The Appellant shot her again. (RR65: 76). He testified that he was\n\nnot sure where he shot her, but he had been trying to shoot her in the head with the\n\nfirst shot. (RR65: 76).\n\n      According to the Appellant, Shania tried to swim out of the water toward the\n\nembankment. (RR65: 76). The Appellant went down the embankment ―to finish\n\nwhat I was doing.‖ (RR65: 77). He told Shania he was not going to shoot her\n\nagain, and helped pull her out of the water. (RR65: 77–78).\n\n      The Appellant testified that Shania said: ―Why, Wish?‖ (RR65: 79). She\n\ntold him that the right side of her body was going numb. (RR65: 79). Once she\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\fwas out of the water, the Appellant told her to lie down. (RR65: 79–80). Shania\n\nwas not showing any emotion and complied with his instructions. (RR65: 80).\n\nWhile she was lying there, looking up at him, he put his foot on her neck. (RR65:\n\n80). The Appellant was not sure how long he stood there with his foot on her neck.\n\n(RR65: 81). When he finally removed his foot, he told her he was sorry and rolled\n\nher into the river. (RR65: 82).\n\n      The Appellant went back to his car, sat for a few minutes, and then left the\n\npark to dispose of the items he had used. (RR65: 84). First, the Appellant broke\n\nthe throwaway phone and threw it out of the window near the crime scene. (RR65:\n\n85). He then threw Shania‘s iPhone in a pond near his gym. (RR65: 85). He put\n\nhis muddy sneakers in the storm drain next to the pond. (RR65: 86). Next, he\n\nthrew the clip from the gun out of the window while he was driving on Interstate\n\n635. (RR65: 86). He threw the gun into a pond on the way to pick his wife up\n\nfrom work. (RR65: 86). The Appellant testified that Jawanna did not get off of\n\nwork until 9:00pm, but he arrived at 8:00pm, and sat in the car and cried. (RR65:\n\n87). The Appellant testified that he could not sleep that night. (RR65: 88). The\n\npolice came to his apartment the following day and he went with them to the\n\nCarrollton Police Department, voluntarily. (RR65: 90).\n\n      The Appellant admitted that the four video-taped interviews with the police\n\nwere full of lies, but claimed that he was telling the truth about being innocent of\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fthe sexual assaults. (RR65: 91–100). The Appellant testified that he lied because\n\nhe was trying to cover up what he had done. (RR65: 91). The Appellant denied\n\nany involvement in the crime in the first two interviews, but finally confessed\n\nbecause his mother would have wanted him to. (RR65: 91–97). The Appellant\n\nadmitted that he did not tell the detectives everything, including the fact that the\n\ntext messages were fake. (RR65: 97).\n\n      The Appellant agreed to the fourth interview with the detectives because he\n\nwanted closure and wanted to confess everything. (RR65: 100). The Appellant\n\ntestified that he agreed to interviews with Channel 4 and Channel 8 because he\n\nwanted to get everything off of his chest, and he wanted everyone to know that he\n\ndid not have sex with Shania. (RR65: 101). The Appellant testified that he knew\n\nhe was going to win if he went to trial on the sexual assault charges because he had\n\nthe recordings of Shania. (RR65: 106). The Appellant testified that the recordings\n\nshowed that her story changed multiple times. (RR65: 106).\n\n      On cross-examination, the Appellant admitted that he began to plan to kill\n\nShania in July 2012. (RR65: 108). The Appellant admitted that every time he\n\ncontacted Shania he was pretending to be ―D.‖ (RR65: 109). The Appellant agreed\n\nthat Shania had a crush on ―D.‖ (RR65: 109). The Appellant admitted that he told\n\nthe police he did not have a 903 number, he did not contact Shakeema Morsley, he\n\ndid not go to Carrollton or Mesquite, and he was not at Hebron High School.\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\f(RR65: 115). The Appellant admitted that he had lied to the detectives because he\n\nthought he could get away with Shania‘s murder. (RR65: 115, 119).                 The\n\nAppellant admitted that he never told anyone that the text messages were fake.\n\n(RR65: 112). In fact, during his interview with David Schechter from Channel 8,\n\nhe said that he had text messages that proved that Shania lied. (RR65: 122–23).\n\nThe Appellant testified that he was confident he would win at trial because of the\n\nrecordings, not because of the text messages; however, he called his attorney\n\nimmediately after he made the text messages. (RR65: 138). He admitted that he\n\nwould have used the text messages at the trial even though they were fake. (RR65:\n\n139).\n\n        The Appellant admitted that he told the detective with the Carrollton Police\n\nDepartment and David Schechter with Channel 8 that Shania had made up the\n\nsexual assault allegations because her mother made her. (RR65: 127). However,\n\nduring the conversations Shania had with ―D,‖ she never said that she lied about\n\nthe sexual assaults and never told him that her mother made her lie. (RR65: 130).\n\n        Lynne Corsi, an attorney and licensed social worker, testified as an expert in\n\nchild sexual assault cases. (RR65: 193–96). Corsi did not review any of the\n\nmaterials related to this capital murder, but she did review the files, police reports\n\nand interviews related to the sexual assault allegations. (RR65: 196).          Corsi\n\nreviewed Tom Cox‘s file and testified there was nothing substantive in the file\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\frelating to any potential defense, despite the fact that Cox had spent a year on the\n\ncase. (RR65: 204). Cox did not file any motions in the Appellant‘s case. (RR65:\n\n204). Corsi also reviewed Hugo Aguilar‘s file, and while there were notes in the\n\nfile, there were no discovery motions, interview notes, or any indication that\n\nAguilar had met with the Appellant. (RR65: 205–06). There was no indication that\n\neither Cox or Aguilar ever requested or employed an investigator to work on the\n\ncase. (RR65: 206–07).\n\n       Corsi testified that if she had represented the Appellant on the sexual assault\n\ncharges she would have immediately filed a motion for an investigator. (RR65:\n\n208). She would have met with the Appellant on numerous occasions and asked\n\nhim to bring collateral witnesses, whom she would have interviewed separately.\n\n(RR65: 208). She would have requested discovery from the State, and would have\n\nspecifically requested Shania‘s forensic interview. (RR65: 208–09). She would\n\nhave also listened to the recordings that the Appellant made. (RR65: 210).\n\n       Arty Hayes, the Appellant‘s brother-in-law and his pastor, provided\n\ncounseling to the Appellant concerning the sexual assault allegations. (RR65: 263–\n\n67).   Hayes testified that the Appellant and Jawanna drove from Dallas to\n\nTexarkana to meet with him. (RR65: 268). Hayes and his co-pastor, William\n\nCooper, met with the Appellant alone first. (RR65: 267). The Appellant wanted\n\nthem to know that he was innocent and was very disturbed about the situation.\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f(RR65: 267). According to Hayes, the Appellant seemed very concerned and\n\ndepressed. (RR65: 268).\n\n                                  State’s Rebuttal\n\n      Shirley Brown, and her two daughters Julia and Jazmine, testified that\n\nShania told them about the sexual assaults. Shirley testified that Shania came to\n\nher house crying in the spring of 2011. (RR65: 290). Shania told Shirley that she\n\nhad something she wanted to tell her but was scared because if she told anyone,\n\n―someone would come up hurt.‖ (RR65: 291). Ultimately, Shania told Shirley that\n\na man had been raping her when she was babysitting. (RR65: 292). He would hold\n\na sword to her neck and force himself on her. (RR65: 292).\n\n      Julia Adams also testified that Shania told her that a man was raping her\n\nwhen she was babysitting. (RR65: 304–06). Shania told her that he would put\n\nswords in her face and threatened that if she told anyone about what was going on\n\nhe would hurt her and her family. (RR65: 305–06).\n\n      Shania told Julia that the sexual intercourse was a ―habit‖ at first. (RR65:\n\n308–09). Julia clarified that this meant that the Appellant had already threatened\n\nher, ―so she tried to look over it, tried to cope with it,‖ but then he became rough\n\nwith her. (RR65: 309). Shania became afraid because he told her: ―I‘m going to\n\nkill your family if you tell. Remember if you tell, I‘m going to kill you and your\n\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\ffamily.‖ (RR65: 309). Julia testified that Shania did not want to have sex with the\n\nAppellant. (RR65: 309).\n\n      Jazmine Adams testified that there was a day in April 2011 when Shania\n\ncame to school dressed in sweats instead of her school uniform. (RR65: 318–19).\n\nShania told Jazmine that her mother had caught her texting a twenty year-old man\n\nand put her out of the house. (RR65: 319). Jazmine found out that the Appellant\n\nhad sexually assaulted Shania. (RR65: 320).\n\n      Jennifer Dibrell testified that she retrieved the Appellant‘s property from the\n\nMesquite Police Department following his arrest for the sexual assault charges.\n\n(RR65: 334–35). The Appellant told her not to give Jawanna his cell phone.\n\n(RR65: 335). Jennifer testified that she and the Appellant argued about him being\n\nthere when Shania was babysitting because there was no reason to have a\n\nbabysitter if the Appellant was going to be at the apartment with the kids. (RR65:\n\n337). Jennifer also testified that when the sexual assault allegations came up, the\n\nAppellant asked her to write a statement for him stating that her children said he\n\nwas never alone with Shania, but she refused. (RR65: 337–38).\n\n      Jawanna Arrington testified that the Appellant picked her up from work on\n\nSeptember 6, 2012. (RR65: 351). Jawanna noticed that the Appellant had sprayed\n\na lot of cologne in the car, and she thought there had been another woman in the\n\ncar. (RR65: 352). Jawanna testified that the Appellant was more affectionate than\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fusual that night. (RR65: 353). They took a bubble bath, cooked dinner, and were\n\nintimate. (RR65: 353).\n\n      Jawanna testified that the Appellant never showed her the text messages that\n\nled to the sexual assault charges. (RR65: 353–54). He only told her ―his version of\n\nwhat they said.‖ (RR65: 354). He told Jawanna that Shania had sent him a text\n\nmessage asking him if he loved Jawanna. (RR65: 354).          The Appellant told\n\nJawanna that he said yes, and Shania responded: ―I wish I didn‘t have these\n\nfeelings.‖ (RR65: 34). The Appellant told Jawanna he replied: ―I can‘t have you in\n\nthat way.‖ (RR65: 355). The Appellant told her he did not want to hurt Shania‘s\n\nfeelings. (RR65: 355). They did not discuss the messages any further. (RR65:\n\n355). After the Appellant was arrested for capital murder, Jawanna moved his\n\nbelongings, including some swords, out of her apartment and gave them to his\n\nsister. (RR65: 356).\n\n                               Punishment Phase\n\n                              State’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      During the punishment phase of the Appellant‘s trial, the State presented\n\nevidence of the Appellant‘s escape from Parkland Hospital while in the custody of\n\nthe Dallas County Sheriff‘s Department awaiting trial for capital murder. Dallas\n\nCounty Sheriff‘s Deputy Steven Underwood testified that he was assigned to guard\n\nthe Appellant on the evening of December 4, 2012. (RR66: 143–84).              The\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fAppellant was admitted to Parkland on December 1st after complaining that he\n\nwas dizzy, and was due to be discharged that evening at 9:30pm. (RR66: 147;\n\nRR68: 68; SX: 240). This was the Appellant‘s sixth visit to Parkland since his\n\narrest for capital murder in September. (RR68: 67–68; SX: 240). Shortly after\n\n8:00pm, the Appellant asked Underwood if he could take a shower before he was\n\ntaken back to jail. (RR65: 147). Underwood agreed. (RR66: 148).\n\n        The Appellant was restrained with leg restraints and handcuffs, and\n\nUnderwood decided to remove them so the Appellant could shower. (RR66: 148).\n\nOnce Underwood removed the Appellant‘s leg restraints, he sat up on the side of\n\nthe bed and turned to face Underwood. (RR66: 148). When the handcuffs were\n\nalso removed, the Appellant told Underwood: ―I‘m sorry, man,‖ and grabbed\n\nUnderwood by his gun holster and vest and backed him into the wall. (RR66: 148–\n\n50). The Appellant had some type of sharp object in his left hand and told\n\nUnderwood he would cut him if he moved. (RR66: 150–51). Underwood grabbed\n\nthe Appellant and backed him into the left corner of the room. (RR66: 151). The\n\ntwo wrestled around and the Appellant reached for Underwood‘s gun. (RR66:\n\n151).\n\n        Underwood tried to knock the Appellant to the ground but was unable to.\n\n(RR66: 151–52). The two continued to wrestle, and then Underwood heard a\n\n―pop.‖ (RR66: 152). Underwood‘s holster had broken and the Appellant had his\n\n\n\n                                       33\n\fgun. (RR66: 152). The gun was a fully loaded Glock 22, 40-caliber. (RR66: 167,\n\n170). Underwood put his hands in the air and complied with the Appellant‘s\n\ncommands to get on the ground. (RR66: 155–56). The Appellant then fled the\n\nroom. (RR66: 157).      Underwood called his supervisor and chased after the\n\nAppellant, but was unable to apprehend him. (RR66: 179).\n\n      After his escape, the Appellant fled the hospital to a residential\n\nneighborhood a few blocks from the hospital. (RR66: 187–88). At approximately\n\n8:30pm, the Appellant knocked on Mary Cassio‘s door and asked for help. (RR66:\n\n184–85). The Appellant claimed that someone was shooting at him and stole his\n\ncar. (RR66: 185). He did not have a shirt or shoes and was wearing hospital pants\n\nand hospital bracelets. (RR66: 186). Cassio, whose three teenage children and\n\ndaughter-in-law were also in the home, did not let him in. (RR66: 184–86).\n\nInstead, she told the Appellant she was going to call 911. (RR66: 186). The\n\nAppellant told her not to call the police because he had warrants, and took off\n\nrunning down the street. (RR66: 187). When Cassio went outside, she found a\n\nyellow hospital sock on the ground which appeared to contain a gun. (RR66: 189).\n\nCassio testified that while the Appellant did not show any aggression toward her,\n\nshe also testified that there were multiple people in the home, which the Appellant\n\nwas able to see. (RR66: 196–98).\n\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\f      Senior Corporal Christian Dalesandro, a sniper and negotiator with the\n\nDallas SWAT team, testified generally about the duties of the Dallas Police\n\nDepartment SWAT team, and specifically about his involvement in the Appellant‘s\n\ncapture following his escape from Parkland Hospital. (RR67: 49–71). Dalesandro\n\nresponded to a location off of Harry Hines Boulevard on December 4, 2012.\n\n(RR67: 49–50, 52).     Approximately twenty-two to twenty-five Dallas SWAT\n\nofficers were at the location. (RR67: 55). The Appellant had been located in a red\n\nAustin‘s Barbeque van parked between two buildings. (RR67: 54; SX: 292, 293,\n\n294, 295). A patrol sergeant was speaking with the Appellant, but Dalesandro\n\neventually took over the communications. (RR67: 56). Dalesandro and the SWAT\n\nsnipers were unable to see the Appellant‘s left hand and were concerned he had a\n\nweapon. (RR67: 60–61).\n\n      Dalesandro noted that there were no negotiations with the Appellant because\n\nthere were no hostages and there was nothing he wanted from the Appellant.\n\n(RR67: 57). Instead, Dalesandro informed the Appellant that he was surrounded\n\nby Dallas SWAT and was no longer dealing with the Parkland Police or with the\n\nDallas Police Department. (RR67: 59). Dalesandro informed the Appellant that he\n\ncould place his hands out of the vehicle, surrender, and be taken back into custody\n\nwithout further event. (RR67: 59). Otherwise, they would use alternatives that\n\nwould be more difficult for the Appellant. (RR67: 59). Dalesandro explained that\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\fthey could shoot gas into the vehicle which would have made it difficult, if not\n\nimpossible, for the Appellant to stay inside. (RR67: 59–60).      Ultimately, the\n\nAppellant came out of the vehicle and was returned to custody. (RR67: 61).\n\n      In addition to the evidence of the Appellant‘s escape, the State also\n\npresented evidence of the Appellant‘s criminal history through certified copies of\n\nhis prior convictions. (SX: 245–48). On August 30, 1999, the Appellant pled\n\nguilty the offense of theft $1,500 and was sentenced to five years‘ deferred\n\nadjudication community supervision. (SX: 245). His probation was revoked on\n\nOctober 29, 2001, and he was sentenced to fifteen months‘ confinement in state\n\njail. (SX: 245). One of the grounds for the revocation was the commission of a\n\nnew offense—burglary of a motor vehicle on or about January 30, 2001. (RR66:\n\n141–42; SX: 245). On October 12, 2001, the Appellant entered a plea of guilty to\n\nthe offense of evading arrest detention and was sentenced to thirty days in jail.\n\n(SX: 246). On that same day, the Appellant also pled guilty to the offense of\n\nfailure to identify and was sentenced to thirty days in jail. (SX: 247).      On\n\nNovember 26, 2007, the Appellant pled guilty to the charge of fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer and was sentence to twenty-two days in jail.\n\n(SX: 248).\n\n      The State also presented testimony concerning the Appellant‘s lies,\n\nmanipulation, infidelity and violence against women.        Over the course of\n\n\n\n                                       36\n\fapproximately five years, the Appellant had five children with different women:\n\ndaughter Kurstyne with Latrice Brown in 2000; son Trey with Linda Crawford in\n\n2001; son Ahmad with Labrena Henderson in 2001; daughter Dezire with Jennifer\n\nDibrell in 2004; and son TK6 with Nicole.\n\n         Linda Crawford, the mother of the Appellant‘s twelve year-old son Trey,\n\ntestified about several incidents where the Appellant was physically violent with\n\nher. (RR66: 80). The first incident occurred when she was seven or eight months\n\npregnant with Trey. (RR66: 85). Linda testified that she surprised the Appellant at\n\nhis apartment and found him with another woman. (RR66: 85, 101). Linda tried to\n\npush her way into the apartment, but the Appellant came outside, pushed her and\n\ntold her to ―get going and don‘t come around here.‖ (RR66: 86, 103–04). He\n\ngrabbed her by the throat and held her against the building, then told her to leave.\n\n(RR66: 86). He pushed her and shoved her away from the apartment, all the way\n\nto a convenience store. (RR66: 86).\n\n         Sometime after Trey was born, the Appellant called her over to his\n\napartment so they could be ―intimate.‖ (RR66: 87). While she was there, Labrena,\n\nthe mother of the Appellant‘s other son, returned home and wanted to know why\n\nLinda was there. (RR66: 87–88, 106). The Appellant pretended not to know, and\n\nfeeling embarrassed, Linda began to argue with him. (RR66: 88). At one point,\n\n\n6\n    The record does not reflect when TK was born.\n\n\n                                               37\n\fLinda threw a baby‘s milk bottle at the Appellant, hitting him in the face. (RR66:\n\n116). The Appellant picked up the bottle and poured the milk over her head.\n\n(RR66: 116, 118–19).\n\n      As Linda was leaving, the Appellant swung a clothes hanger at her and hit\n\nher on her arm. (RR66: 88). Linda was holding Trey, who was only a few months\n\nold, and had to ―let him go‖ to defend herself against the Appellant‘s assault.\n\n(RR66: 88). She was able to catch Trey before he hit the ground, but she ended up\n\nwith a cut on her arm from the clothes hanger. (RR66: 88). Linda‘s father called\n\nthe police and the Appellant was arrested for assault. (RR66: 88).\n\n      Linda testified that she knew the Appellant had a thirteen year-old daughter,\n\nKurstyne with Latrice Brown, another son named Ahmad, who is approximately\n\ntwelve, with Labrena Henderson, and another son named TK with a woman named\n\nNicole. (RR66: 89–90). Linda did not learn that TK was the Appellant‘s son until\n\nher was arrested in this case, despite the fact that TK and his mother lived in the\n\nsame apartment complex as Linda and Trey, and the two boys played together.\n\n(RR66: 90).\n\n      Labrena Henderson, the mother of the Appellant‘s son Ahmad, testified that\n\nshortly after she had Ahmad, the Appellant would leave for days at a time and not\n\ntell her where he was going. (RR66: 127–28). On one occasion, when Labrena\n\nquestioned the Appellant about where he had been, he got upset and pushed her up\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fagainst a wall. (RR66: 127–28).      Labrena immediately left and went to her\n\nmother‘s house. (RR66: 128).\n\n      The Appellant was also violent with his wife Jawanna. Jawanna testified\n\nthat the Appellant ―put his hands on her‖ on several occasions. (RR66: 202). He\n\nwould choke her, threaten her with knives, and on two occasions, had put a gun to\n\nher head. (RR66: 202, 209–10). Jawanna testified that the incidents would begin\n\nwith an argument, and when she responded to his anger with silence, he would\n\ngrab her around the neck with both hands and choke her. (RR66: 202–03).\n\nJawanna testified that this happened more than twenty times over the course of\n\ntheir relationship. (RR66: 204). Jawanna testified that they would argue about\n\neverything from the Appellant having a bad day to her catching him texting other\n\nwomen. (RR66: 205). On one occasion when they were arguing over her cell\n\nphone, the Appellant forced Jawanna to the floor against the fireplace. (RR66:\n\n204). She ended up with bruises and scratches on her back from the bricks on the\n\nfireplace. (RR66: 204). Jawanna did not call the police because she loved the\n\nAppellant and did not want him to get in trouble, nor did she want her family to\n\nfind out about the abuse. (RR66: 203).\n\n      Finally, the State presented the testimony of Melodye Nelson, a 24-year\n\nveteran of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (―TDCJ‖), and an expert in\n\nthe Texas prison system. (RR67: 94–156). Nelson is currently the senior warden\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fof the Mountain View Unit, a maximum security facility that houses the female\n\ndeath row population, and she previously served as the major of correctional\n\nofficers at the Polunsky Unit, which houses the male death row population. (RR67:\n\n95–96).\n\n      Nelson testified generally about the number and types of facilities in the\n\nTDCJ, the number of inmates and guards, how inmates are classified, and the\n\nopportunities for violence within the Texas prison system. (RR67: 95–156).\n\nNelson testified that, despite the security present in the TDCJ, violence still occurs\n\nin both minimum security areas and on death row. (RR67: 119–20). This includes\n\nassaults, sexual assaults, gang activity and murder. (RR67: 120).\n\n                             Appellant’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      The Appellant presented evidence concerning his difficult childhood,\n\nincluding his mother‘s murder and his upbringing in foster care. Clifford Harper,\n\na former detective with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (―SLMPD‖)\n\nin St. Louis, Missouri, worked many crimes in the Cabanne Courts neighborhood\n\nwhere the Appellant was raised. (RR67: 166). The neighborhood was known for\n\nits gang activity, drugs, and violent crime. (RR67: 166). Harper characterized the\n\nneighborhood as one of the worst in St. Louis. (RR67: 166).\n\n      During Harper‘s twenty years with the SLMPD, he spent six years as a\n\nhomicide detective. (RR67: 165). One of the homicides Harper investigated was\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fthe February 1, 1997 murder of Appellant‘s mother, Brenda Elkins. (RR67: 167–\n\n68, 179). Elkins was raped, sodomized and shot point blank in the head with a 12-\n\ngauge pump shotgun. (RR67: 168). Harper described the crime scene as one of the\n\nworst he had ever seen. (RR67: 177). Jerry Brandon was ultimately convicted of\n\nthe crime and remains in prison. (RR67: 177). The Appellant was not present\n\nduring the murder. (RR67: 180).\n\n      Rose McGill, the Appellant‘s foster mother when he was fifteen, testified\n\nthat the Appellant was always full of joy. (RR67: 217, 221, 224). He was obedient\n\nand did not cause any disruptions while he lived with her. (RR67: 227). However,\n\nMcGill felt that the Appellant had a lot of anger because he felt that someone in his\n\nfamily should have taken him and his brother in, rather than letting them go into\n\nfoster care. (RR67: 225). The Appellant even had relatives that lived down the\n\nstreet from McGill; however, they did not want to take him into their home.\n\n(RR67: 225–26). McGill made sure that the Appellant had contact with his family\n\nwhile he was living with her, but the Appellant expressed quite a bit of resentment\n\ntoward them. (RR67: 225).\n\n      The Appellant‘s older sister, Dorothy, ended up taking the Appellant and his\n\nbrother once she turned twenty-one. (RR67: 227–29). McGill was against this and\n\nwould have welcomed the Appellant to continue living with her. (RR67: 227).\n\nMcGill believed that the Appellant‘s sister was not stable enough to care for two\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\fteenagers when she was only twenty-one or twenty-two years old, and was\n\nadditionally caring for her own two young sons. (RR67: 227–29).\n\n      While McGill noted that the Appellant needed love, he never needed any\n\nspecial resources from the State. (RR67: 239). McGill taught the Appellant how to\n\nabide by the rules, to keep his hands to himself, and to be respectful to women.\n\n(RR67: 239–40).     The Appellant was always respectful to her and the other\n\nchildren. (RR67: 240). McGill was disappointed when she learned about his\n\nbehavior when he went to live with his sister. (RR67: 240–41). She would talk to\n\nthe Appellant and tell him that he was getting on the wrong track, but there was\n\nnothing else she could do. (RR67: 241). McGill always had a place for the\n\nAppellant, even up to the present day. (RR67: 243–44).\n\n      Dorothy Elkins, the Appellant‘s older sister, testified about the environment\n\nshe and her siblings grew up in. (RR67: 246). When Dorothy was approximately\n\nthree or four years old, CPS began an investigation into the family, and became\n\nconcerned that their mother, Brenda, was not properly caring for her and her\n\nbrother Tony. (RR67: 247–48). Tony, the oldest sibling, is mentally disabled and\n\nhas been in an assisted living center in Missouri his entire life. (RR67: 246).\n\nDorothy was sent to California, where she lived for the next five or six years, until\n\nshe was nine years old. (RR67: 248). When Dorothy returned to St. Louis, she\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\flearned that her mother had given birth to five children while she was gone.\n\n(RR67: 248). The Appellant was the youngest of the children. (RR67: 249, 266).\n\n      The family lived in a three bedroom apartment in the Cabanne Courts\n\nneighborhood, where drugs and violence were common. (RR67: 249–51). The\n\nchildren were not allowed to play outside because of the violence, but when they\n\ndid go outside they often saw drug deals and shootings. (RR67: 250–52). On one\n\noccasion, people came to their apartment looking for their uncle because he had\n\nbeen selling drugs on another person‘s territory. (RR67: 253). The men shot her\n\nuncle in the leg in front of everyone. (RR67: 253).\n\n      Dorothy‘s grandfather, Lawrence, also lived with them. (RR67: 250).\n\nDorothy testified that her grandfather molested everyone in the house, including\n\nher. (RR67: 265). She also testified that he was the father of Brenda‘s oldest son,\n\nTony. (RR67: 165–66). As far as sleeping arrangements, Brenda had her own\n\nroom, her grandfather and her brother Michael shared a room, and the other five\n\nchildren slept in the third bedroom. (RR67: 251). Dorothy shared a bunk bed with\n\nher sister, while her three brothers shared another bunk bed. (RR67: 251).\n\n      The family lived there until Dorothy was fourteen or fifteen years old.\n\n(RR67: 251). They had to move when Brenda was arrested for shooting a man.\n\n(RR67: 256). CPS placed all of the children in foster care. (RR67: 251–52, 257).\n\nDorothy and her sister went to one foster home, while the brothers were sent to a\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fdifferent home. (RR67: 257). At some point, the Appellant was separated from his\n\nbrothers and was sent to yet another foster home. (RR67: 257). However, their\n\nAunt Rose and Uncle James quickly came and took all of the children to live with\n\nthem in Texarkana, Arkansas. (RR67: 258).\n\n      Their mother was released from prison approximately two-and-a-half years\n\nlater, and came to live with them in Texarkana. (RR67: 258–59). They lived with\n\nAunt Rose and Uncle James until Brenda was able to afford an apartment. (RR67:\n\n259). They were reunited for less than a year when Brenda was arrested for\n\nviolating her parole and was sent back to Missouri. (RR67: 259). Dorothy, who\n\nwas seventeen, stayed with her aunt and uncle, while her younger brothers—\n\nSammy, John and the Appellant—went back to foster care. (RR67: 260). Dorothy\n\nbelieved that the Appellant lived in at least four different foster homes during his\n\nteenage years. (RR67: 257).\n\n      Eventually, the Appellant and Sammy came to live with her. (RR67: 261–\n\n62). Dorothy had a four bedroom apartment where she lived with her two sons and\n\ntheir father. (RR67: 262). When the Appellant turned seventeen, he moved out of\n\nDorothy‘s apartment and moved in with his girlfriend, Kenzie Monroe. (RR67:\n\n263). Dorothy agreed that the Appellant moved a lot during his twenties, moving\n\nfrom Illinois to Georgia to California. (RR67: 264).       When he met Jawanna\n\nArrington, he finally began to settle down. (RR67: 264).\n\n\n\n                                        44\n\f      On cross-examination, Dorothy testified that her grandfather never forced\n\nher to have sexual intercourse, but had fondled her. (RR67: 271–72). Dorothy also\n\ntestified that during the summer of 2012, when the sexual assault cases were\n\npending, the Appellant attended Rob‘s All-White Boat party and also hosted an\n\nanniversary party at his apartment. (RR67: 280–83; SX: 300). She testified that the\n\nAppellant was happy on those occasions and there had been money for alcohol at\n\nthe party. (RR67: 283–85).\n\n      Brenda Griffin, the Appellant‘s therapist at the Youth Home, a non-profit\n\nfacility for troubled youths and teenagers in Texarkana, Arkansas, testified that the\n\nAppellant was at the facility for three-and-a-half months when he was fifteen.\n\n(RR68: 22–24). Griffin testified that the Appellant had very few ties in the world,\n\nbut was very bonded with his family. (RR68: 24). The Appellant did not have any\n\ndisciplinary problems while he was at the Youth Home. (RR68: 28).\n\n      Patrick Gill, a counselor at the Youth Home, worked with the Appellant\n\nduring his time at the facility. (RR68: 33). Gill testified that the Appellant was\n\nalways respectful, polite and did what was asked of him. (RR68: 34).            The\n\nAppellant was sent to Youth Home a month after his mother was murdered\n\nbecause he was having problems dealing with her death. (RR68: 34–35). The\n\nAppellant talked about his mother‘s death and worked on his coping skills. (RR68:\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f36). Gill testified that the Appellant completed the program faster than most.\n\n(RR68: 36).\n\n      Sergenant Ed Chattaway with the Texarkana Police Department testified that\n\nthe Appellant assisted in the arrest of his uncle, Robert Elkins. (RR67: 184).\n\nChattaway was the lead investigator working on two robberies that occurred in\n\nTexarkana, Arkansas in June 2004. On June 4th, a masked man robbed a Triple J\n\nat gunpoint; and on June 15th, a man robbed an E-Z Mart and raped the store clerk.\n\n(RR67: 199, 202–03).\n\n      A Crime Stoppers tip naming Elkins as the perpetrator was received on June\n\n9.7 ((RR67: 186, 203). Based on that tip, Chattaway began surveillance of Elkins.\n\n(RR67: 204). On June 22nd, the Appellant contacted Chattaway and told him that\n\nhe had information on Elkins‘ involvement in the crimes. (RR67: 86–87).\n\nChattaway learned that the Appellant had been arrested with his uncle on June 7th\n\nfor possession of a criminal instrument. (RR67: 199–200; SX: 297). A flashlight,\n\npliers, gloves, and a holster for a handgun were recovered from the car that Elkins\n\nwas driving. (RR67: 199–200).\n\n      Chattaway met with the Appellant and was told that Elkins had committed a\n\ncouple of robberies and had raped a store clerk at an E-Z Mart. (RR67: 187–88).\n\n\n7\n Crime Stoppers records revealed that a $1,000 reward was paid for the tip. (RR67: 207; SX:\n299).\n\n\n                                            46\n\fAppellant also told Chattaway that Elkins was planning to rob an Advance Auto\n\nParts store if certain employees were present at the time. (RR67: 189). As a result\n\nof the Appellant‘s information, a small team was set up to conduct surveillance of\n\nthe store on June 22, 2004. (RR67: 189, 206).         While Elkins did make an\n\nappearance at the store that night, he never got out of his vehicle and left shortly\n\nafter the store closed. (RR67: 190–92). Chattaway and his team set up surveillance\n\nagain the next night, June 23, 2004 following another tip from the Appellant.\n\n(RR67: 192).\n\n      Elkins did arrive that night and after behaving in a suspicious manner, was\n\nconfronted by Chattaway‘s team, and ultimately taken into custody. (RR67: 192–\n\n95). Elkins had a silver handgun, a toboggan with eye holes cut out, and gloves at\n\nthe time he was taken into custody. (RR67: 196). Elkins, who was ultimately\n\ncharged with two counts of aggravated robbery, rape and possession of a firearm,\n\nand attempted aggravated robbery, was sentenced to two terms of life\n\nimprisonment. (RR67: 197; DX: 34). Appellant testified at the November 2007\n\ntrial. (RR67: 207).\n\n      James Aiken testified as an expert on the prison system. (RR68: 49). Aiken\n\nreviewed the records related to the Appellant‘s case, including the records\n\nconcerning his escape from Parkland Hospital (RR68: 49, 57, 63). Aiken testified\n\nthat an escape has to be ―diagnosed,‖ meaning that the circumstances surrounding\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\fthe escape need to be reviewed, i.e., what was the opportunity, how well planned\n\nwas it, how old is it, and whether the prison system can adequately manage\n\nsomeone who has been involved in that type of activity. (RR68: 58). Aiken\n\ntestified that an escape is not necessarily predictive of whether that person will try\n\nto escape again. (RR68: 58). Aiken also testified that as a person gets older, he\n\ngenerally becomes more compliant, especially in a super-structured environment\n\nlike prison. (RR68: 57).\n\n      Aiken discussed what he referred to as prisoners with ―juice‖ and prisoners\n\nwithout ―juice.‖ (RR68: 61). Prisoners with ―juice‖ are prisoners who can control\n\nevery aspect of a prison operation by using power and control. (RR68: 61).\n\nInmates without ―juice‖ are not movers and shakers, and are vulnerable within the\n\nsystem. (RR68: 61). Aiken testified that the Appellant‘s vulnerability level was\n\nextremely high because of the nature of his offense. (RR68: 62). In Aiken‘s\n\nopinion, the Appellant would not have any ―juice‖ in prison, and the biggest issue\n\nwith the Appellant would be keeping him alive if he was exposed to the general\n\npopulation. (RR68: 62). Aiken did not interview the Appellant, but relied instead\n\non the official reports from the police and correctional officers. (RR68: 63–64).\n\n      Frank AuBuchon, an expert in the Texas prison system, testified that if the\n\nAppellant was sentenced to life without parole and placed in general population,\n\nthe least restrictive custody level the Appellant could be assigned is G4, for a\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\fminimum of ten years. (RR68: 89).         However, in AuBuchon‘s opinion, the\n\nAppellant should be sent to administrative segregation because of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding this offense and because he physically assaulted a law\n\nenforcement officer and disarmed him in order to escape. (RR68: 89). AuBuchon\n\ntestified that if an inmate was willing to take the necessary steps and risks to\n\neffectuate an escape once, he would likely be willing to do it again. (RR68: 97).\n\nAccordingly, AuBuchon opined that the TDCJ would want to lock such an inmate\n\ndown in the most secure situation possible until the inmate presented less of a risk\n\nor no risk of escaping. (RR68: 97).\n\n      Latrice Brown, the mother of the Appellant‘s oldest child Kurstyne, testified\n\nthat the Appellant cared for Kurstyne while she served three years in prison.\n\n(RR68: 110–11, 114–15). Latrice also testified that the Appellant and his sisters\n\npaid her electric bill for her on one occasion when she had been unable to afford it.\n\n(RR68: 113). She denied that the Appellant had ever been physically violent with\n\nher. (RR68: 117). However, she did receive a letter from the Appellant in July\n\n2013, while he was in jail, in which he opened the letter by writing he was ―pissed\n\noff at you right now.‖ (RR68: 115–16). Latrice testified that he was mad at her\n\nbecause she was not getting Kurstyne to write to him while he was in jail. (RR68:\n\n115–16, 118–19).\n\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f      Finally, the Appellant‘s daughter Kurstyne testified that she was happy when\n\nshe lived with the Appellant and Jennifer Dibrell. (RR68: 125–27). She also\n\ntestified that she had not seen the Appellant since he was arrested in this case, but\n\nshe loves him very much. (RR68: 128).\n\n                                  State’s Rebuttal\n\n      Sherry Gray-James testified about the night that the Appellant escaped from\n\nParkland Hospital. (RR69: 20). Sherry testified that her husband was at work and\n\nshe and her son Zachary were home alone. (RR69: 20). Detective Williams called\n\nher and told her that the Appellant had escaped and expressed concerns for her\n\nsafety. (RR69: 21–22). Sherry testified that she was terrified. (RR69: 21–22). She\n\nturned off all of the lights in the house and held Zachary. (RR69: 22). Sherry\n\ntestified that she thought the Appellant was going to kill her. (RR69: 22).\n\n      Sherry also testified that Zachary missed Shania, and would watch videos of\n\nShania singing. (RR69: 23).          Because Zachary is nonverbal he cannot\n\ncommunicate how he feels about what happened, but he kisses the phone when he\n\nwatches the videos. (RR69: 23). Finally, Sherry explained:\n\n      The impact that it‘s had on our life is nothing compared to what\n      Shania went through. I wouldn‘t even dare try to compare it. But\n      having my safety taken away, having my daughter brutally taken away\n      because of someone who was a coward, having my daughter‘s\n      integrity questioned, all of this loss is just compounded because one\n      person couldn‘t tell truth. Shania had no reason to lie. The impact it\n      had on me was because I raised a kid that had good values. I raised a\n      kid who had good morals. I raised a kid that the only person in this\n\n                                         50\n\f      courtroom that had something bad to say about is the person who\n      killed her.\n\n      […]\n\n      To have somebody come to your house and even contemplate taking\n      your life threatens every single fiber of your safety. Every day when I\n      leave my house, I‘m looking around. I don‘t know him. Never knew\n      him. I don‘t know anything about him. If I had known that he was\n      even remotely close to my daughter and in any arm‘s length of her,\n      there‘s no way she would have baby-sat. There‘s absolutely no way.\n\n      For that, I have to think about that every single day that a baby-sitting\n      job cost her her innocence; it cost her her life; it cost her her future.\n      Her very first baby-sitting job. And that shouldn‘t have happened.\n\n(RR69: 23–25).\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Issues 1-3:     The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s Batson\n\nchallenges to the State‘s exercise of peremptory challenges against three minority\n\nveniremembers. The Appellant has not met his burden to show that the State‘s\n\nstrikes were the product of racial discrimination.\n\n      Issue 4: The decision to dismiss John Bigley from the jury was a proper\n\nexercise of the trial court‘s discretion.     After receiving evidence and hearing\n\ntestimony concerning Bigley‘s work related pressures, the trial court properly\n\ndetermined that Bigley was disabled due to emotional stress and would be unable\n\nto fully and fairly perform the functions of a juror. Alternatively, any error was\n\nharmless.\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f         Issue 5: The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s motion to quash the\n\nindictment.\n\n         Issue 6: The trial court acted within its discretion in denying the Appellant‘s\n\nNovember 1, 2013 motion for continuance. The trial court‘s actions did not deny\n\nthe Appellant his constitutional right to due process or deny him the effective\n\nassistance of counsel on the issue of mitigation during the punishment phase of his\n\ntrial.\n\n         Issues 7-10: The trial court‘s rulings on the Appellant‘s four motions to\n\nsuppress were proper.\n\n         Issue 11: The evidence is sufficient to support the Appellant‘s conviction\n\nfor capital murder. Contrary to the Appellant‘s assertions, the record is replete\n\nwith evidence showing the Appellant killed Shania Gray to prevent her from\n\ntestifying against him at the upcoming sexual assault trial, and considering all of\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the jury‘s verdict, a rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the essential elements of capital murder beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n         Issue 12: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling the\n\nAppellant‘s Rule 403 objection to two photographs depicting the complainant‘s\n\nbody at the crime scene.\n\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\f         Issues 13-18: The Appellant failed to preserve his complainants concerning\n\nthe admission of the six audio recordings, Defense Exhibits A, B, C, E, F, and G,\n\ncontaining phone conversations the Appellant recorded between Shania Gray and\n\nhimself while he employed his false identity ―D.‖ While the Appellant argues on\n\nappeal that the recordings were admissible under Article 38.36 of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, he did not offer the recordings pursuant to that statute at trial.\n\nAlternatively, the trial court properly excluded the recordings as inadmissible\n\nhearsay, and the Appellant has failed to show harm.\n\n         Issues 19-21: The trial court properly sustained the State‘s objections to the\n\ntestimony of defense witnesses Arty Hayes, Ashlye Sams, and Lamar Leggiton that\n\nthe Appellant told them he had not sexually assaulted Shania Gray. The statements\n\nwere hearsay and were not admissible as prior consistent statements under Rule\n\n801(e)(1)(B).\n\n         Issue 22: The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s request for a jury\n\ninstruction on anti-speculation during the guilt-innocence phase of his trial. The\n\njury was properly instructed on the law applicable to the Appellant‘s case.\n\n         Issue 23: The Appellant has not shown that the prosecutor‘s arguments fell\n\noutside the permissible areas of jury argument. In any event, the argument taken\n\nas a whole was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the Appellant‘s\n\nguilt.\n\n\n\n                                           53\n\f        Issue 24: The evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury‘s answer to\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue.\n\n        Issues 25-35: The Appellant‘s arguments regarding the punishment charge\n\nare inadequately briefed and multifarious. Regardless, the trial court properly\n\ndenied his requested instructions and properly overruled his objections to the\n\ncharge.\n\n        Issues 36-37: The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s requested jury\n\ninstructions defining evidence that reduces ―moral blameworthiness.‖ This Court\n\nhas already considered the arguments raised by the Appellant and has rejected\n\nthem.\n\n        Issues 38-48: The Appellant‘s admittedly meritless federal constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Texas death penalty statute are presented only to preserve the\n\ncomplaints for federal habeas review. And while Appellant invites this Court to\n\nrevisit its prior holdings against his position, he provides no new authority for this\n\nCourt or the State to address.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\n STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 1-3:   THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN DENYING\n                      THE APPELLANT’S BATSON CHALLENGES.\n\n        In Issues 1 through 3, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his objection based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1988) to the\n\nState‘s use of peremptory challenges on veniremembers Syrene Mitchell, Louise\n\n                                          54\n\fHorsley, and Freddie Watson. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 53–66). These contentions\n\nlack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and the U.S. Constitution prohibit\n\nthe use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.261(a) (West 2006); Batson, 476 U.S. at 85;\n\nWatkins v. State, 245 S.W.3d 444, 447 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Under Batson, a\n\ndefendant must first make a prima facie showing that the prosecution exercised its\n\nperemptory challenges on the basis of race. Reed v. Quarterman, 555 F.3d 364,\n\n368 (5th Cir. 2009). If the defendant makes that showing, the burden shifts to the\n\nprosecutor to present race-neutral explanations for striking the jurors in question.\n\nId. The court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of\n\nproving purposeful discrimination. Id.\n\n      At the second step of this process, the proponent of the strike need only\n\ntender an explanation that is race-neutral. Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447.          The\n\nultimate plausibility of that race-neutral explanation is to be considered as part of\n\nthe third step of the analysis. In the third step, the trial court determines whether\n\nthe opponent of the strike (usually the defendant) has satisfied his burden of\n\npersuasion to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the strike was\n\nindeed the product of the proponent‘s racial discrimination. Id.       Whether the\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\fopponent satisfies this burden, is a question of fact for the trial court to resolve in\n\nthe first instance. Id.\n\n       Where the prosecutor articulates his reasons for the challenged peremptory\n\nstrike in the record and the trial court rules on the ultimate question of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, the issue of whether the defendant established a prima facie case\n\nbecomes moot. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447; Young v. State, 283 S.W.3d 854,\n\n866 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       This Court should not overturn the trial court‘s resolution of the Batson issue\n\nunless it determines that the trial court‘s ruling was clearly erroneous. See Watkins,\n\n245 S.W.3d at 447–48. In assaying the record for clear error, this Court should\n\nconsider the entire record of voir dire.           It may consider arguments or\n\nconsiderations not presented to the trial court so long as they are manifestly\n\ngrounded in the appellate record. Id. at 448. A trial court‘s conclusion that a\n\nfacially race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge is genuine, rather than\n\na pretext, should be given great deference and reversed only when that conclusion\n\nis, in view of the record as a whole, clearly erroneous. Id.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n1. Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, but the issue\nis moot.\n\n       After the parties exercised their peremptory strikes, the Appellant objected\n\nto the composition of the jury and asserted his Batson objections. (RR53: 25–27).\n\n                                          56\n\fThe Appellant identified three African-American potential jurors that the State\n\nstruck. (RR53: 26–27). The State objected on the basis that Appellant had failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case. (RR53: 27). However, without waiting to obtain a\n\nruling, the State explained its reasons for striking the prospective jurors. (RR53:\n\n27–31). Consequently, this Court must assume that Appellant satisfied his step-\n\none obligation to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and address\n\nonly the second and third steps. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448; see also\n\nChambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 23 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (where the State fails\n\nat trial to object to the trial court‘s failure to rule on the defendant‘s prima facie\n\ncase, that issue becomes moot and it cannot be raised on appeal).\n\n2. The State’s explanations for its strikes of the three prospective jurors were\nrace-neutral.\n\n      At the second step of the Batson process, the prosecutor need only tender an\n\nexplanation that is race-neutral on its face. Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 769\n\n(1995) (indicating the State has a burden of production in the second step merely to\n\npresent a facially valid explanation for its strike); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447.\n\nThe State satisfied this burden.\n\n                        Syrene Mitchell and Louise Horsley\n\n      At the Batson hearing, the State explained that it struck all qualified\n\nprospective jurors, ―regardless of anything else that they said,‖ who ranked\n\nthemselves as a ―3‖ or higher on question number two of their questionnaire.\n\n                                         57\n\f(RR53: 28). Question number two asks: ―With reference to the death penalty,\n\nwhich of the following statements best represents your feelings?‖ (Q. p. 2)\n\n(emphasis in original).     A ranking of ―3‖ indicates the following opinion:\n\n―Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long\n\nas the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of circumstances.‖\n\n(Q. p. 2).\n\n       The State explained that it struck every person on the qualified-juror panel\n\nthat selected number ―3,‖ including Syrene Mitchell (Juror 396-A, an African-\n\nAmerican male), Steven Sperry (Juror 1336-A, a Caucasian male), Louise Horsley\n\n(Juror 422-B, an African-American female), and Penelope Cook (Juror 149-C, a\n\nCaucasian female), from the alternate pool, on the same grounds. (RR53: 28–29).\n\nThe record reflects that the State also struck Steven Sperry (Juror 1336-A, a\n\nCaucasian male), who also selected ―3‖ in response to this question. (RR53: 16, Q.\n\np. 2). The State‘s reason was grounded in Mitchell‘s and Horsley‘s opinion about\n\nthe death penalty and is race-neutral. Courts have found similar grounds as facially\n\nneutral. See, e.g., Mathis v. State, 67 S.W.3d 918, 924–25 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)\n\n(holding prosecutor‘s explanations—that he struck a juror because she was in favor\n\nof the death penalty only in two specified circumstances and she felt the death\n\npenalty was imposed too frequently—were facially race-neutral).\n\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\f      Additionally, the State noted that Mitchell ―would hold the State to a higher\n\nburden of proof in a death penalty case.‖ (RR53: 28). During voir dire, Mitchell\n\nstated multiple times that he would hold the State to a higher burden of proof than\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt because this was a case in which the State was seeking\n\nthe death penalty. (RR22: 101–04; 148–57). The State challenged Mitchell for\n\ncause on this basis, but the challenge was denied. (RR22: 157). This explanation is\n\nalso race-neutral. See, e.g., Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 450–51 (prosecutor‘s\n\nexplanation in a burglary case that the juror would hold the State to a higher\n\nburden than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in order to assess a life\n\nsentence, was race-neutral).\n\n                                 Freddie Watson\n\n      At the Batson hearing, the State provided the court with three reasons that it\n\nexercised its peremptory challenge against Watson. (RR53: 29–31, 36–38). First,\n\nthe State noted that it struck Watson because of his answer to question number\n\ntwelve on the juror questionnaire. (RR53: 29–30; 36–37; Q. p. 4). Question\n\nnumber twelve asks:\n\n      The crime of ―Obstruction‖ means harming or threatening to harm\n      another person to prevent or delay the service of that person as a\n      witness or perspective witness. The law in the State of Texas says that\n      the intentional murder of an individual during the course of\n      committing or attempting to commit the offense of “obstruction” is a\n      capital offense for which, depending on the facts and circumstances of\n      the case, a sentence of life without parole or the death penalty may be\n      imposed? Do you agree with the punishment range outlined above?\n\n                                        59\n\f(Q. p. 4) (emphasis in original). While Watson checked ―yes‖ in response to the\n\nquestion, in the explanation portion of his answer Watson wrote: ―Life without\n\nparole would be better for me.‖ (Watson, Q. p. 4). Second, the State noted that\n\nalthough Watson acknowledged during voir dire that he had heard some of the\n\nfacts of this case, he had failed to disclose this on his questionnaire. (RR38: 96–98;\n\nRR53: 30; 37). Finally, Watson also indicated during voir dire that he believed a\n\nperson charged with a crime should be released from jail pending the outcome of\n\nthe trial. (RR53: 30–31). According to the State, it struck Watson due to the\n\ncombination of these three things. (RR53: 29–31; 36–38).\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      The record supports all of the State‘s proffered race-neutral explanations for\n\nexercising peremptory strikes against the three prospective minority jurors.\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the State satisfied its\n\nburden of producing facially race-neutral explanations for its peremptory strikes.\n\nSee Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n3. Appellant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nstrikes were the product of racial discrimination.\n\n      Appellant failed to demonstrate purposeful discrimination by the State.\n\nHere, the defendant has the burden to persuade the trial court that the prosecutor‘s\n\nexplanations for the State‘s strikes were incredible or disingenuous. Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457. The focus of the Batson inquiry in this stage is on the genuineness,\n\n                                         60\n\fnot reasonableness, of the asserted non-racial motive. Nieto v. State, 365 S.W.3d\n\n673, 676 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). The question of pretext is a question of fact for\n\nthe trial court to resolve, subject to reversal on appeal only for clear error. Watkins,\n\n245 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n      Appellant primarily contends that the State‘s strikes must have been racially\n\nmotivated because these jurors were qualified jurors and had some characteristics\n\npotentially favorable to the State‘s position on the death penalty. (Appellant‘s Brief\n\nat pp. 53–61). The jurors‘ qualifications for jury service are irrelevant to the\n\nanalysis, however.       Factors relevant to determining whether purposeful\n\ndiscrimination has been proven include the following:\n\n      1. whether the State utilized its option to shuffle the jury panels in a\n         manner that supported an inference of race discrimination;\n      2. whether the prosecutor‘s office trying the case followed a formal\n         policy to exclude minority venire members from jury service\n         which was known to at least one of the prosecutors at trial;\n      3. whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges to eliminate\n         a far greater proportion of minority venire members than non-\n         minority venire members;\n      4. whether the reasons the State asserted for eliminating the minority\n         venire members in question appeared to apply equally well to\n         many non-minority venire members whom the State did not\n         challenge; and\n      5. whether the State directed questions expressly designed to elicit\n         grounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately, in a manner\n         that suggested an intent to single out minority venire members for\n         elimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\fWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448–49 (relying on Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.S. 231,\n\n240–64, 266 (2005)). This Court looks to the collective and cumulative impact of\n\nthese non–exclusive factors in determining whether an inference of racial\n\ndiscrimination is so powerful that it overcomes the deference given to trial court.\n\nSee id. at 449, 457.\n\n      An analysis of these factors demonstrates that Appellant‘s claim of\n\npurposeful discrimination lacks merit.\n\n                                    (1) Jury Shuffle\n\n      There was no jury shuffle in this case. The parties selected the group of\n\nqualified jurors from a March 22, 2013 special venire. (RR5). Appellant does not\n\nassert or demonstrate that the venire was shuffled or otherwise arranged in a\n\nmanner to decrease the possibility of a minority member.\n\n                       (2) Formal Policy Prohibits Discrimination\n\n      The Dallas County District Attorney‘s office‘s notorious formal policy of\n\nexcluding minorities is a relic of a bygone era. It is common knowledge that the\n\noffice policy of the last several years not only forbids such discrimination, it\n\nrequires an investigation into sustained Batson challenges and authorizes discipline\n\nranging from reprimand to termination. The State asks this Court to take judicial\n\nnotice of this well-known fact. Tex. R. Evid. 201.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 (3) Proportionality of Strikes\n\n         Appellant argues that even one racially motivated peremptory strike violates\n\nBatson and he makes no effort to demonstrate a pattern of discriminatory strikes.\n\nHe does not identify the size or racial makeup of the pool of qualified venire\n\nmembers. Nor does he analyze the number of strikes used by either side or how\n\nthey were used. He merely argues that the State used 3 of its 12 peremptory strikes\n\nto eliminate 50% of the African-Americans on the qualified prospective jury panel.\n\n(Appellant‘s Brief at p. 64). The State disagrees with this statistic. In actuality, the\n\nstatistical data evinces no discriminatory intent.\n\n         The data evinces no discriminatory intent by the State.                The panel of\n\nqualified jurors consisted of 49 people (45-person panel for the 12-person jury and\n\na 4-person pool for the alternates). Of these, 37 (or 75.5%) were Caucasian, 8 (or\n\n16.3%) were African-American, and 4 (or 8.2%) were Hispanic.                       The State\n\nexercised 13 peremptory strikes (12 strikes in order to select a 12-person jury and\n\none strike in the selection of alternates). (RR53: 11–24). Eight of those 13 strikes\n\n(61.5%) were used on Caucasians, 3 (23.1%) were used on African-Americans,\n\nand 2 (15.4%) were used on Hispanic jurors. (RR53: 11–22). Appellant exercised\n\n13 strikes.8(RR53: 11–24). He struck 1 African-American, 1 Hispanic, and 11\n\nCaucasians. (RR53: 11–24). The result was a 12-member jury consisting of 2\n\n\n8\n    The record does not reflect how many strikes the Appellant was permitted.\n\n\n                                                63\n\fAfrican-Americans, 2 Hispanics, and 8 Caucasians, with 1 African-American and 1\n\nCaucasian as alternate jurors.\n\n          By striking 3 African-American jurors, the State eliminated only 37.5% of\n\nthe African-Americans on the panel, not 50% as the Appellant alleges.\n\nNevertheless, the number of African-Americans struck by the State is, by itself, an\n\nirrelevant statistic. It gains relevance only by establishing its correlation to the\n\nentire panel. See Woodward v. Epps, 580 F.3d 318, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding\n\nthat the State‘s striking 100 percent of the black jurors alone does not support a\n\nfinding of discrimination and does not show any disparity in relation to the non-\n\nminority jurors). In the Appellant‘s case, the correlation shows no discriminatory\n\nintent.\n\n          Of the 49 veniremembers who could conceivably be chosen for the\n\nAppellant‘s jury, 8 (16.3%) were African-American. A random selection would\n\nyield either 2 or 3 African-American jurors in the 14 jurors selected (12 plus 2\n\nalternates) (or 16.3% of fourteen, equaling 2.28 jurors). See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 451–52 (holding a random selection from a 22% African-American venire\n\nwould yield 2 or 3 African-American jurors because 22% of 12 jurors, plus 1\n\nalternate, was 2.86).\n\n          The 12-member jury here consisted initially of 8 Caucasians, 2 African-\n\nAmericans, and 2 Hispanics, with an African-American as the first alternate and a\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\fCaucasian as the second alternate. John Bigley, a Caucasian juror, was dismissed\n\nby the court prior to the beginning of the trial. (CR3: 108; RR56; RR57: 78–82).\n\nThe first alternate, an African-American, took Bigley‘s place, meaning that the\n\nfinal 12-member jury now had 3 African-Americans. (CR3: 108). Thus, 16.3% of\n\nthe qualified jurors were African-American and 25% of the 12-person jury was\n\nAfrican-American. Accordingly, the jury had 3 African-Americans, more African-\n\nAmericans than would be expected from a random selection of the 49 qualified\n\njurors. The statistical analysis fails to show any racial discrimination, and this\n\nfactor strongly supports the trial court‘s ruling.\n\n                              (4) Comparative Analysis\n\n      Appellant contends on appeal that the prosecutor‘s stated reasons are a\n\npretext for race discrimination because non-minority jurors with similar responses\n\nwere not struck by the State. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 55–56 (regarding Mitchell),\n\n57–58 (regarding Horsley), 60–61 (regarding Watson), 62 (regarding all three\n\njurors)). At the Batson hearing, however, defense counsel failed to provide a\n\ncomparative analysis on the jurors. (RR53: 25–31, 33–38). Counsel did not cross-\n\nexamine the prosecutor about his reasons for not striking any similarly situated\n\nvenire members. (RR53: 25–31, 33–38).                As such, the prosecutor had no\n\nopportunity to respond to counsel‘s allegations. Appellant should not be permitted\n\nto raise claims of disparate treatment for the first time on appeal. By failing to\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\fproperly present this claim at trial, he denied the prosecutor the opportunity to\n\ncreate a record on the prosecutor‘s strategy, and he denied the trial court an\n\nopportunity to rule on the claim. Whether a prosecutor intended to discriminate on\n\nthe basis of race is a question of historical fact properly decided in the trial courts.\n\nSee Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 367–69 (1991). State procedural rules\n\ndemand that allegations of disparate treatment by the prosecutor be raised in the\n\ntrial court, so that they can be properly answered by the State and decided by that\n\ncourt. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457–58 (Keller, P.J.,\n\nconcurring); Young v. State, 826 S.W.2d 141, 147–49 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)\n\n(Campbell, J., dissenting).\n\n      The State acknowledges this Court‘s majority opinion in Young that a non-\n\ncapital defendant is not required to raise a comparative analysis in the trial court to\n\nhave evidence of such considered on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 145–46. The\n\nFifth Circuit has applied Young to a capital case and criticized this Court‘s\n\ninconsistency in its application of the contemporaneous objection rule to Batson\n\nclaims in capital cases. Reed, 555 F.3d at 370.\n\n      This Court should explicitly overrule Young. See generally Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457–58 (Keller, P.J., concurring); Young, 826 S.W.2d at 147–49\n\n(Campbell, J., dissenting). Its majority—and the courts that rely on it—view the\n\ncomparative analysis as merely an appellate argument that can be fairly addressed\n\n\n\n                                          66\n\ffor the first time on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 146. In truth, it is a factual\n\nallegation of unfair treatment between jurors. If properly raised in the trial court,\n\nthe prosecution‘s response may provide additional facts for the appellate court to\n\nconsider when reviewing the Batson ruling. If raised at trial successfully, the trial\n\ncourt can cure the error before trial even begins.\n\n       If not raised at trial, the prosecutor‘s mental process and the trial judge‘s\n\ncredibility decision concerning the non-strikes are simply omitted from the record.\n\nJurors are not products of a set of cookie cutters, and the unexplained decision not\n\nto strike a non-minority juror who shares one trait in common with a minority juror\n\nis held against the State on appellate review. See, e.g., Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 244\n\n(stating, ―If, indeed, Fields‘s thoughts on rehabilitation did make the prosecutor\n\nuneasy, he should have worried about a number of white panel members he\n\naccepted with no evident reservations.‖) (emphasis added).         The prosecutor‘s\n\nexplanation of her voir dire strategy and the trial court‘s ruling on the strategy is\n\ncritical to a fair appellate review.\n\n       At the very least, a prosecutor should enjoy favor on appeal when the matter\n\nis not raised at trial, much like the presumption against a finding of ineffective\n\nassistance of defense counsel.         In claims regarding violations of a client‘s\n\nconstitutional right to counsel, this Court has stated that ―counsel should ordinarily\n\nbe accorded an opportunity to explain her actions before being condemned as\n\n\n\n                                           67\n\funprofessional and incompetent.‖ Bone v. State, 77 S.W.3d 828, 836 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002). A prosecutor‘s credibility is the heart of Batson review, and she\n\nshould be accorded no less of an opportunity to explain her actions.\n\n      This Court should conclude that the comparative analysis is not preserved\n\nfor review or, alternatively, presume that the comparative analysis favors the\n\nprosecutor absent affirmative evidence on the record.\n\n      In any event, Appellant has wholly failed to establish that the potential jurors\n\nwho are the focus of his Batson challenge were similarly situated to non-minority\n\npotential jurors who were not struck.\n\n                        Syrene Mitchell and Louis Horsley\n\n      As argued above, the State struck each and every qualified prospective juror\n\nregardless of race who ranked him/herself as a ―3,‖ indicating a belief that,\n\n―Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long\n\nas the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of circumstances.‖\n\n(Q. 2; RR53: 28–29, 35–36).        The State struck all 5 ―3s‖ on the qualified\n\nprospective juror panel. (RR53: 28–29, 35–36). Appellant points to no evidence to\n\nthe contrary.   He cannot show disparate treatment of Mitchell and Horsley\n\ncompared to accepted non-minority veniremembers. As such, Appellant has failed\n\nto show that the prosecutor‘s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                   Freddie Watson\n\n      The State explained that it struck Watson because he was the only person on\n\nthe panel that (1) knew about the facts of the case, (2) wrote on his questionnaire\n\nthat ―life without parole would be better for me‖ in a case in which the aggravating\n\nfactor elevating the charge to capital murder was obstruction, and (3) he believed\n\nthat people charged with a crime should be released pending the outcome of the\n\ntrial. (RR53: 29–31, 36–38). Appellant has not shown that any other prospective\n\njurors that responded similarly, and the State finds none.\n\n      Importantly, during the Batson hearing, defense counsel did not challenge\n\nthe prosecutor‘s stated reason. Whether Appellant‘s counsel personally felt such\n\ninformation should be the basis for a strike, is irrelevant; nothing indicates this was\n\na pretext for discrimination. He cannot show that Watson was treated differently\n\nfrom non-minority venire members who the State accepted.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has wholly failed to show that any of the three jurors that are the\n\nfocus of the first three issues on appeal were similarly-situated to non-minority\n\njurors that were not struck by the State.\n\n                              (5) Disparate Questioning\n\n      Finally, Appellant points to no instances of disparate questioning by the\n\nState. Cf. Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 256–57 (prosecutors used a graphic script when\n\n\n\n                                            69\n\fdescribing the death penalty to African-American jurors who were ambivalent to\n\nthe death penalty more often than with white jurors who also were ambivalent).\n\nNor is any disparate questioning apparent in the record.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nState‘s exercise of its peremptory challenges against three African-Americans was\n\nthe product of racial discrimination. Appellant has not shown that the State‘s\n\nexplanations did not apply equally to non-minority venire members that the State\n\ndid not challenge, that the State directed questions expressly designed to elicit\n\ngrounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately, or that a formal policy\n\nexcludes minorities from jury service. The record before this Court supports the\n\ntrial court‘s resolution of the fact question of pretext. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Appellant‘s Batson challenges against prospective jurors\n\nMitchell, Horsley and Watson. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 456–57.\n\n       Issues 1 through 3 should be overruled.\n\n    STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 4: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN DISMISSING\n                     JOHN BIGLEY9 FROM THE JURY PANEL.\n\n       In Issue 4, the Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\ndismissing Juror John Bigley from the jury because the court did not fully develop\n\n9\n  While Appellant refers to John Bigley as Juror Number 4, the record reflects that Bigley was\nactually Juror Number 6. (RR53: 32, 39).\n\n\n\n                                             70\n\fthe issue of whether Bigley‘s emotional state made him unfit and unable to\n\ncontinue as a juror under Article 36.29(b). (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 66–70).\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      The record reflects that Bigley filled out the juror questionnaire on March\n\n22, 2013. (RR29: 74). At that time, Bigley stated that he worked as an independent\n\nconsultant on business development for start-up tech companies. (Juror\n\nQuestionnaire). On June 6, 2013, Bigley was called for individual voir dire.\n\n(RR29: 74–155). Bigley noted that he had taken a job with a software firm called\n\nIn Continuum. (RR29: 82; RR56: 14; CR2: 314). Bigley explained that he was the\n\nchannel manager for Microsoft and was scheduled to go to training in early\n\nSeptember, but because this was a new job, other things could come up. (RR29:\n\n82). Bigley also expressed concern about putting too many demands on his new\n\nemployer. (RR29: 82). Bigley stated that he was told that the trial would be over\n\nby the first of September. (RR29: 82). During his voir dire, the State informed\n\nBigley that the trial had a firm start date of August 19, 2013. (RR29: 83–84).\n\nBigley stated that he ―should be‖ available on August 19th, and the last two weeks\n\nof August. (RR29: 83).\n\n      On July 5, 2013, Bigley was selected as juror number six. (RR53: 39). On\n\nAugust 8, 2013, Appellant filed his first motion for continuance. (CR2: 221–79).\n\nOn August 20, 2013, the trial court granted the motion and reset the trial for\n\n\n\n                                         71\n\fNovember 4, 2013. (CR2: 241). Following the continuance, the court coordinator\n\ncontacted the jurors, and of those, only Bigley indicated that he would not be\n\navailable on November 4, 2013 due to a conflict with work. (RR56: 6, 12–13).\n\n      On August 29, 2013, a hearing was held pursuant to Article 36.29(b) of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure to determine whether Bigley should be dismissed\n\nfrom the jury. (RR56: 5). The trial judge noted that he had called Bigley to discuss\n\nthe situation, and Bigley was adamant that due to his work situation he did not\n\nbelieve he could be fair and impartial to both sides and carefully weigh the\n\nevidence because his mind would be elsewhere. (RR56: 6).\n\n      The judge stated that he contacted Bigley‘s boss, Philip Hyde, located in the\n\nNetherlands, via email. (RR56: 7). The email exchange was admitted for purposes\n\nof the hearing. (RR56: 7; CR2: 313–17).         Hyde informed the court that he\n\nunderstood the importance of jury service, but explained that Bigley was vital to\n\nthe fledgling software company. (CR2: 314). Hyde explained that Bigley was the\n\ncompany‘s only employee located in the United States and was responsible for\n\ndeveloping and managing strategic relationships with IBM, Microsoft, and NEC.\n\n(RR56: 8; CR2: 314). Hyde further explained that the company planned to expand\n\nmore aggressively into the United States in 2014. (CR: 314). Therefore, Bigley\n\nwould be vital during the fourth quarter of 2013, and ―taking him out of the loop‖\n\n\n\n\n                                        72\n\fduring the relevant two week period in November would be a ―serious detriment‖\n\nto the business.‖ (CR: 314).\n\n      At the hearing, Bigley testified that he would be distracted during the trial\n\nbecause he would be thinking about the work he would need to do in the mornings\n\nand evenings before and after court each day. (RR56: 14–15). Bigley explained:\n\n―So I will be thinking of other things while I‘m – you know, if I‘m – I have to\n\nadmit to you, I will probably be drifting a little bit.‖ (RR56: 14–15). After Bigley\n\nprovided further details about his job and his duties, the following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n      THE COURT:         Let me ask you this, Mr. Bigley. Is it fair to say\n                         that because of your emotional state, you‘re\n                         concerned that you would not be attentive during\n                         the trial?\n\n      BIGLEY:            That‘s correct.\n\n(RR56: 18). Bigley stated that ―if push came to shove, I would be here, but I don‘t\n\nwant to be here under a cloud.‖ (RR56: 24). On September 6, 2013, the trial court\n\nentered an order dismissing Bigley and replaced him with first alternate Sheila\n\nJustice. (CR3: 108).\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n      Article 36.29(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides:\n\n      If alternate jurors have been selected in a capital case in which the\n      state seeks the death penalty and a juror dies or becomes disabled\n      from sitting at any time before the charge of the court is read to the\n\n                                           73\n\f      jury, the alternate juror whose name was called first under Article\n      35.26 of this code shall replace the dead or disabled juror. Likewise, if\n      another juror dies or becomes disabled from sitting before the charge\n      of the court is read to the jury, the other alternate juror shall replace\n      the second juror to die or become disabled.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.29 (b) (West 2006).\n\n      A disability for purposes of Article 36.29 includes ―any condition that\n\ninhibits a juror from fully and fairly performing the functions of a juror.‖ Routier v.\n\nState, 112 S.W.3d 554, 588 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003); Reyes v. State, 30 S.W.3d\n\n409, 411 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). This Court has noted that a juror is disabled if\n\nhe becomes physically, mentally, or emotionally impaired and can no longer fully\n\nand fairly perform the functions of a juror. Landrum v. State, 788 S.W.2d 577, 579\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1990); Carrillo v. State, 597 S.W.2d 769, 771 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1980).\n\n      Lacking the ability to concentrate due to emotional stress caused by a death\n\nin the family, a family illness, or time pressures of a new job have been held\n\nexamples of such disabling conditions. Ramos v. State, 934 S.W.2d 358, 369 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1996); see also Owens v. State, 202 S.W.3d 276, 277 (Tex.

Valdez v. State, 952 S.W.2d 622, 624 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 1997, pet. ref‘d).\n\n      The determination as to whether a juror is disabled is within the discretion of\n\nthe trial court, and absent an abuse of that discretion, no reversible error will be\n\nfound. Routier, 112 S.W.3d at 588; Brooks v. State, 990 S.W.2d 278, 286 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1999). A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts without reference\n\nto guiding rules or principles. Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 380 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1990). As long as the trial court‘s ruling is within the ―zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement,‖ there is no abuse of discretion. Santellan v. State, 939\n\nS.W.2d 155, 169 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997).\n\n               Applicability of Article 36.29 to the Appellant’s Case\n\n      Article 36.29 applies once the jury is sworn. Broussard v. State, 910 S.W.2d\n\n952, 957 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (citing Williams v. State, 631 S.W.2d 955, 957\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1982, no pet.)); Bermea v. State, 188 S.W.3d 337, 339 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Tyler 2006, no pet.). While the jury in this case was selected on July 25,\n\n2013, the jury was not sworn until November 4, 2013. (RR53: 31–32, 38–39;\n\nRR60: 35–36). Juror Bigley was excused from service, and replaced by first\n\n\n\n                                         75\n\falternate Sheila Justice, on September 6, 2013, prior to the time the jury was\n\nsworn. (CR3: 108; RR53: 32, 39). Accordingly, Article 36.29 was not applicable\n\nto the Appellant‘s case.      The Appellant, however, does not challenge the\n\napplicability of the statute; rather, he challenges the trial court‘s dismissal of\n\nBigley because the court did not delve deeply enough into Bigley‘s emotional state\n\nunder Article 36.29.\n\n      Nevertheless, this Court has upheld the application of Article 36.29 by a trial\n\ncourt faced with the same situation as the one presented in this case. In Broussard,\n\nthe trial court excused a juror after the jury was selected, but before the jury was\n\nsworn, finding that he was disabled due to work related pressure. Broussard, 910\n\nS.W.2d at 957. In so doing, the trial court relied on Article 36.29(b) and replaced\n\nthe excused juror with an alternate juror. Id. On appeal, the defendant argued that\n\nthe trial court had erred in applying Article 36.29 and should not have replaced the\n\nexcused juror with the alternate; instead, the trial court should have chosen a\n\nreplacement from the jurors remaining on the original panel list. Id. at 957. This\n\nCourt denied the defendant‘s challenge, explaining:\n\n      Faced with the need to complete the jury, and having no specific\n      statutory directive, the trial court chose an acceptable option by\n      replacing the disabled venireman with a venireman who had already\n      been qualified and accepted by both parties. We find no error in the\n      court‘s action.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\fId. at 958. This Court further held that even if the trial court had erred, any error in\n\nreplacing the juror with the first alternate was harmless, reasoning that had the trial\n\ncourt waited until the jury was sworn, the trial court would have been bound by\n\nArticle 36.29(b) and would have been required to replace the disabled juror with\n\nthe first alternate. Id.\n\n       In this case, the trial court was faced with the same situation.         Bigley\n\nbecame unable to serve after the jury was selected but before it was sworn;\n\naccordingly, the trial court‘s application of Article 36.29(b) was appropriate under\n\nthe circumstances. See also Bermea, 188 S.W.3d at 339.\n\n                                     Application\n\n       The trial court‘s determination that Juror Bigley‘s emotional state had\n\nrendered him unable to serve as a juror, was soundly within its discretion. The trial\n\ncourt fully developed the issue of whether Bigley‘s work concerns would prevent\n\nhim from fulfilling his duties as a juror. Here, not only did the trial court contact\n\nBigley and Bigley‘s employer to determine the merit of Bigley‘s claims, but the\n\ntrial court also questioned Bigley at the hearing and was able to hear Bigley‘s\n\nresponses to questioning from both the State and defense.\n\n       The record reflects that Bigley had only recently started a new position with\n\na software company based in the Netherlands, and he was the company‘s only\n\nemployee located in the United States. (CR: 314; RR56: 8, 14–15). Bigley was\n\n\n\n                                          77\n\fresponsible for creating relationships with many large companies, including\n\nMicrosoft, and Bigley noted that the fourth quarter of the year was vital to his\n\nwork, especially, as his boss explained, due to the company‘s plans to expand into\n\nthe United States the following year. (CR: 314; RR56: 14–15). Bigley admitted\n\nthat his attention would wander during the trial because he would be focusing on\n\nwhat he needed to do for work during any breaks in the trial. (RR56: 14–15). The\n\ntrial court could have reasonably concluded that Bigley would be preoccupied with\n\nscheduling meetings and making contacts during the court proceedings, and as\n\nsuch, would not be attentive to the testimony or evidence presented at Appellant‘s\n\ntrial.\n\n         The trial court was in the best position to observe and evaluate Bigley‘s\n\nanswers to the questions posed to him and his demeanor during the proceedings.\n\nBased on his observations, the judge determined that Bigley was disabled due to\n\nhis preoccupation with work concerns, which adversely affected his emotional\n\nstate, and would inhibit him from fully and fairly performing the functions of a\n\njuror. See Routier, 112 S.W.3d at 588; Reyes, 30 S.W.3d at 411; Freeman, 838\n\nS.W.2d at 774. Nothing in the record suggests that this determination was an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n         Moreover, even if the trial court erred in determining that Bigley was\n\ndisabled, the error was harmless. The alleged error involved the application of a\n\n\n\n                                         78\n\fstatutory scheme and is non-constitutional error. Whitehead v. State, 437 S.W.3d\n\n547, 556 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2014, pet. ref‘d), Ponce v. State, 68 S.W.3d 718,\n\n721–22 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.) (citing Jones v. State, 982\n\nS.W.2d 386, 391 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998)). Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure\n\n44.2(b) provides that any non-constitutional ―error, defect, irregularity, or\n\nvariance that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.‖ Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 44.2(b).\n\n      A defendant is not harmed by a trial court‘s error in discharging a juror\n\nwhere the record shows the alternate juror seated in the discharged juror‘s place\n\nwas subjected to the same selection process, was properly sworn, heard all of the\n\nevidence,     heard   the   trial   court‘s    charge,   and   was   seated   before\n\ndeliberations. Whitehead, 437 S.W.3d at 556; Sneed v. State, 209 S.W.3d 782, 788\n\n(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2006, pet. ref‘d). The record reflects that Shirley Justice\n\nwas chosen as the first alternate using the same selection process as Bigley, and\n\nwas properly sworn, heard all of the evidence and the charge, and was seated\n\nbefore deliberations. See Sneed, 209 S.W.3d at 788; Ponce, 68 S.W.3d at 722.\n\nAccordingly, the Appellant has the failed to show that he was harmed by the\n\ndismissal of Bigley and seating of Shirley Justice. Issue 4 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\fSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 5: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN DENYING THE\n            APPELLANT’S MOTION TO QUASH THE INDICTMENT.\n\n      In Issue 5, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to quash the indictment. Appellant argues that the indictment fails to allege\n\nan offense with the degree of certainty necessary to give him notice of the\n\nparticular offense with which he was charged. Appellant specifically notes that the\n\nindictment fails to allege the manner and means by which he allegedly committed\n\nthe offense of obstruction. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 70–72).           Appellant‘s\n\ncontentions are without merit and this issue should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n   The indictment in this case alleges that the Appellant:\n\n      . . . did unlawfully then and there intentionally cause the death of\n      SHANIA GRAY, an individual, hereinafter called deceased, by\n      SHOOTING THE DECEASED WITH A FIREARM, A DEADLY\n      WEAPON, AND BY ASPHYXIATING THE DECEASED, and the\n      defendant was then and there in the course of committing and\n      attempting to commit the offense of OBSTRUCTION.\n\n(CR1: 44). Appellant filed a motion to quash the indictment on October 17, 2013.\n\n(CR3: 127–28). In his motion, Appellant argued that the indictment ―fails to\n\nspecify the manner and means by which he allegedly committed the offense of\n\nobstruction with sufficient specificity to allow Defendant to defend himself.‖\n\n(CR3: 127).     Appellant further asserted that the phrase ―in the course of\n\ncommitting and attempting to commit the offense of obstruction‖ did not notify\n\n\n\n                                         80\n\fhim of what part of Section 36.06 of the Penal Code he was ―supposed to have\n\nviolated, who was obstructed, or why.‖ (CR3: 127–28). The trial court denied the\n\nAppellant‘s motion following a hearing on October 18, 2013, finding that the\n\nindictment provided sufficient certainty under Article 21.11 of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure. (RR58: 6). The trial court also noted that there had been\n\nample discovery and pleadings to provide the defendant with sufficient notice of\n\nthe allegations against him. (RR58: 6–7).\n\n                              Law and Application\n\n      When reviewing a trial court‘s decision to deny a motion to quash an\n\nindictment, the reviewing court applies a de novo standard of review. Lawrence v.\n\nState, 240 S.W.3d 912, 915 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citing State v. Moff, 154\n\nS.W.3d 599, 601 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). A defendant must be given notice\n\nbefore trial of the ―nature and cause‖ of the accusation against him. See U.S.\n\nCONST. amend. VI; Tex. Const. art. I, § 10. The notice must be given with\n\nsufficient clarity and detail to enable the defendant to anticipate the State‘s\n\nevidence and prepare a proper defense to it. See U.S. CONST. amend. VI; Tex.\n\nConst. art. I, § 10; Moff, 154 S.W.3d at 601–02; Garcia v. State, 981 S.W.2d 683,\n\n685 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n      An indictment must allege all of the facts and circumstances necessary to\n\nestablish all material elements of the offense charged in plain and intelligible\n\n\n\n                                        81\n\flanguage. Garcia, 981 S.W.2d 685; Bynum v. State, 767 S.W.2d 769, 779 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1989). ―An indictment or information must by direct and positive\n\naverments allege all of the constituent elements of the offense sought to be\n\ncharged.‖ Chance v. State, 563 S.W.2d 812, 814 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978). The\n\nPenal Code defines ―elements of offense‖ as ―(A) the forbidden conduct; (B) the\n\nrequired culpability; (C) any required result; and (D) the negation of any exception\n\nto the offense.‖ Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 1.07(a)(22) (West Supp. 2014).\n\n      In the context of a prosecution for capital murder, this Court has repeatedly\n\nheld that an indictment need not allege the constituent elements of the aggravating\n\nfeature which elevates a murder to capital murder. See, e.g., Alba v. State, 905\n\nS.W.2d 581, 585 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (murder in the course of committing\n\nburglary); Barnes v. State, 876 S.W.2d 316, 323 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (same as\n\nAlba); Beathard v. State, 767 S.W.2d 423, 431 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989) (same as\n\nAlba); Hogue v. State, 711 S.W.2d 9, 14 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986) (murder in the\n\ncourse of committing arson); Hammett v. State, 578 S.W.2d 699, 708 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1979) (murder in the course of committing robbery).\n\n      Accordingly, the State was not required to allege the elements of obstruction\n\nin the instant case. Appellant does not provide any authority which excepts the\n\nfacts and circumstances of this case from the general rule. Furthermore, as noted\n\nby the trial court at the hearing on the motion to quash, Appellant was on notice of\n\n\n\n                                        82\n\fthe exact claims against him through the discovery process as well as through the\n\npleadings filed by the State. (RR58: 5–7).\n\n      Because the trial court did not err in denying Appellant‘s motion to quash\n\nthe indictment, Issue 5 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 6: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR BY DENYING THE\n        APPELLANT’S NOVEMBER 1, 2013 MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE.\n\n      In Issue 6, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nNovember 1, 2013 motion for continuance. Appellant argues that this error denied\n\nhim due process and rendered his counsel ineffective on the issue of mitigation\n\nbecause his trial counsel were unable to properly investigate new evidence\n\nconcerning his childhood sexual abuse. Appellant further argues that this denied\n\nhim a fair punishment hearing. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 73–74). Appellant‘s\n\ncontention lacks merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      At a pretrial hearing on September 21, 2012, the trial court set the\n\nAppellant‘s trial for April 15, 2013. (RR3: 4–5; RR4: 4–5). On October 8, 2012,\n\nthe trial court reset the trial to August 19, 2013 at the request of defense counsel;\n\nno written motion for continuance was filed. (RR6: 6–7). On August 9, 2013, the\n\nAppellant filed his first written motion for continuance. (CR2: 221–79; RR60: 20).\n\nIn the motion, Appellant asserted that additional time was needed to prepare\n\nAppellant‘s mitigation case. (CR: 221–79). Specifically, defense counsel noted\n\n                                         83\n\fthat they were having a difficult time obtaining un-redacted records from the\n\nMissouri Department of Social Services, which were relevant to Appellant‘s\n\nchildhood. (RR55: 4–5).\n\n      In their motion, defense counsel noted that it was obvious from an\n\nexamination of the redacted records that sexual abuse had occurred in Appellant‘s\n\nchildhood home; however, they were unable to determine ―whether [Appellant]\n\nwas abused, whether his siblings were abused, whether he witnessed abuse, [or]\n\nwhat family member did the abusing.‖ (RR55: 5). Counsel noted that these issues\n\nwere extremely important to their mitigation case. (RR55: 5). The trial court did\n\nnot rule on the Appellant‘s motion for continuance at that time. On August 20,\n\n2013, the trial court granted the Appellant‘s motion and reset the trial to November\n\n4, 2013. (CR2: 241).\n\n      On November 1, 2013, the Friday prior to the start of the trial, defense\n\ncounsel filed a second written motion for continuance. (CR3: 137–140). In the\n\nmotion, filed pursuant to Article 29.06 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, defense\n\ncounsel stated:\n\n      It has come to the attention of defense counsel that the Defendant, Mr.\n      Franklin Davis, has an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated\n      upon him. New evidence has come to light as of the afternoon of\n      October 31, 2013. This evidence is paramount to the effective\n      representation of Mr. Davis. This evidence must be investigated for\n      both guilt/innocence issues as well as possible mitigation evidence in\n      a possible punishment hearing.\n\n\n\n                                        84\n\f(CR3: 137).    No further facts were provided. Counsel did not explain what the\n\nnew evidence was, what witnesses might be needed, or how much time they would\n\nneed to complete their investigation. (CR3: 137–40). Neither the motion itself or\n\nthe supporting affidavit were signed by defense counsel. (CR3: 138–39).\n\n      On the morning of November 4, 2013, the first day of trial, the trial court\n\nheld a hearing on the motion. (RR60: 19). The court noted that the trial had\n\nalready been reset twice and that this second written motion for continuance was\n\nfiled at the ―11th hour‖ on Friday at 3:33PM. (RR60: 19–20). The court further\n\nnoted that the motion was strikingly similar to the Appellant‘s first written motion\n\nfor continuance; which also concerned the acquisition of evidence of the\n\nAppellant‘s childhood sexual abuse. (RR60: 20). The court further noted that\n\nduring a pretrial hearing on October 25, 2013, there had been no mention of the\n\npotential that the defense might need another continuance. (RR60: 20–21).\n\n      The court also noted that the Appellant‘s motion did not meet the\n\nrequirements of Article 29.07 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because it did\n\nstate that the necessary testimony could not be procured from any other source\n\nknown to the defendant and that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of\n\nprocuring the testimony by the next term of court. (RR60: 21).\n\n      In response, defense counsel argued:\n\n      MR. WYATT: Your Honor, late on the day on Thursday October\n      31st, I was speaking with the defendant in this case during a contact\n\n                                        85\n\f      visit at Lew Sterrett, first floor mezzanine. And during that\n      conversation things came to light about the defendant‘s past which\n      only the defendant could be able to address specifically.\n      This is not something that was contained in the records that were the\n      source of the Defense asking for the last motion for a continuance in\n      August. That led us to the point where we are now, Your Honor.\n      The information contained in the records that were the gravamen of\n      the motion for continuance in August, after we‘ve investigated those\n      claims made in those records from the Department of Human Services\n      in St. Louis, Missouri, and the defendant being made aware of those\n      records, on Thursday at the 11th hour, as the Court has stated,\n      information came to me, specifically to me, about the defendant‘s past\n      and things that have happened specifically to him that only he would\n      be able to testify to.\n      This is not something that is cumulative because nobody else can\n      testify directly as to what has happened to Mr. Davis himself. And as I\n      stated in the motion, when we‘re talking about an extensive history of\n      sexual abuse perpetrated upon him, only he can speak about the acts,\n      about the things that were done to him by the people who did them to\n      him, and what time, when, how all these things occurred.\n      So that is why it is paramount that the Defense have a motion for\n      continuance to further develop this issue and this evidence that has\n      just recently come to light based on that conversation on October 31st.\n      The information that we have will shed light on Mr. Davis‘s life, and\n      in context this crime, and special issues involved in this case.\n      Specifically, Special Issue No. 2, mitigation evidence based on what\n      he told me.\n      And Your Honor, because of that, and because we have proof of it\n      from or some proof of it from the DHS records that were part of the\n      motion for continuance in August, at this point in time, Your Honor,\n      we have to more fully develop that. And that‘s why we‘ve asked for\n      this motion for continuance based on the statements of Mr. Davis on\n      October 31st.\n\n(RR60: 22–23). Defense counsel conceded to the trial court that the Appellant was\n\nthe only person that had the necessary information, and as far as defense counsel\n\n\n                                        86\n\fknew, there were no other witnesses to procure. (RR60: 23–24). The trial court\n\ndenied the motion, but instructed defense counsel to have their investigator\n\ncontinue his investigation into the new evidence and provide the court with a daily\n\nupdate on the status of the investigation. (RR60: 26).\n\n                         Preservation and Applicable Law\n\n      A sworn, written motion is required to preserve a trial court‘s denial of a\n\nmotion for continuance for appellate review. Anderson v. State, 301 S.W.3d 276,\n\n280–81 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Dewberry v. State, 4 S.W.3d 735, 755 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1999); see also Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 29.03, 29.08 (West 2006).\n\n      This Court reviews a trial court‘s denial of a motion for continuance under\n\nan abuse of discretion standard. Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 775 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2007). (citing Janecka v. State, 937 S.W.2d 456, 468 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1996)). To establish an abuse of discretion, there must be a showing that the\n\ndefendant was actually prejudiced by the denial of his motion. Id. To establish an\n\nabuse of discretion, the defendant must show (1) that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying the motion and (2) that the lack of continuance actually prejudiced the\n\ndefendant. Id.; see also Gonzales v. State, 304 S.W.3d 838, 842–43 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2010).\n\n      The defendant must show that the case made for the delay was so convincing\n\nthat no reasonable trial judge could conclude that scheduling and other\n\n\n\n                                         87\n\fconsiderations as well as fairness to the State outweighed the defendant‘s interest\n\nin the delay of the trial. Gonzales, 304 S.W.3d at 842–43. With respect to the\n\nsecond prong, prejudice will be found from a denial of continuance ―only if the\n\nrecord shows with considerable specificity how the defendant was harmed by the\n\nabsence of more preparation time than he actually had.‖ Id. Speculation will not\n\nsuffice to obtain reversal for a trial court's failure to grant a continuance.\n\nNwosoucha v. State, 325 S.W.3d 816, 825 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010,\n\npet. ref‘d) (citing Renteria v. State, 206 S.W.3d 689, 702 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006)).\n\n      ―The matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial\n\njudge, and it is not every denial of a request for more time that violates due\n\nprocess even if the party fails to offer evidence or is compelled to defend without\n\ncounsel.‖ Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 590 (1964). ―There are no mechanical\n\ntests for deciding when a denial of a continuance is so arbitrary as to violate due\n\nprocess. The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case,\n\nparticularly the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is\n\ndenied.‖ Rosales v. State, 841 S.W.2d 368, 374 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992)\n\n(quoting Ungar, 376 U.S. at 589–90); Nwosoucha, 325 S.W.3d at 828.\n\n      However, in the absence of an abuse of discretion, there generally can be no\n\nviolation of due process. Nwosoucha, 325 S.W.3d at 828 (citing Hicks v.\n\nWainwright, 633 F.2d 1146, 1148 (5th Cir. 1981) (―When a denial of a continuance\n\n\n\n                                        88\n\fforms a basis of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, not only must there have\n\nbeen an abuse of discretion, but it must have been so arbitrary and fundamentally\n\nunfair that it violates constitutional principles of due process.‖)).\n\n                                      Application\n\n      The Appellant has failed to preserve his complaint for appellate review.\n\nAppellant‘s motion does not comply with Article 29.08 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure because the motion was not properly sworn. (CR3: 137–39).             The\n\naffidavit included with the motion for continuance was signed by a notary and\n\ncontains the notary‘s jurat, but it is not signed by the affiant—Appellant‘s defense\n\ncounsel. (CR3: 139). A motion for continuance that is not sworn preserves nothing\n\nfor review. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 29.08 (West 2006); Dewberry, 4\n\nS.W.3d at 755–56. Nevertheless, Appellant has failed to show that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his motion or that he was actually prejudiced by the denial.\n\n      The November 1, 2013 motion for continuance was Appellant‘s third\n\nrequested continuance.      Two previous continuances had been granted at the\n\nAppellant‘s request; the first continuance reset the trial from April 13, 2013 to\n\nAugust 19, 2013, and the second continuance reset the trial to November 4, 2013.\n\n(RR6: 6–7; CR2: 241). The November 1, 2013 motion for continuance contains\n\nonly general averments that new evidence had been brought to defense counsel‘s\n\nattention concerning Appellant‘s ―extensive history of sexual abuse.‖ (CR3: 137).\n\n\n\n                                           89\n\fNo supporting facts were alleged and there is no mention of the amount of time\n\nneeded to complete the investigation into the ―new evidence‖ or to locate a\n\nmaterial witness. (CR3: 137–39). Furthermore, at the hearing on the motion,\n\ndefense counsel conceded that the only person with the necessary information\n\nconcerning the abuse was the Appellant. (RR60: 22–24). Counsel further noted\n\nthat they did not expect there to be any additional witnesses who could testify\n\nabout the alleged sexual abuse. (RR60: 23–24).\n\n      Moreover, it is clear from the record that defense counsel were aware that\n\nsome form of sexual abuse occurred in the Appellant‘s childhood home as of\n\nAugust 8, 2013, when defense counsel informed the trial court that they were\n\ntrying to obtain the un-redacted records from the Missouri Department of Social\n\nServices. (RR55: 4–5). The trial court gave Appellant and his defense team three\n\nmonths to obtain the records and conduct their mitigation investigation. However,\n\nAppellant waited until October 31, 2013 to provide his counsel with this ―new\n\nevidence‖ that he was sexually abused as a child. Counsel offered no explanation\n\nfor the last minute revelation by Appellant, or why counsel and Appellant had not\n\npreviously discussed the issue. Consequently, Appellant has failed to show that\n\nthe trial court erred in denying the motion.\n\n      Appellant has also failed to show any specific prejudice resulting from the\n\ndenial of the motion for continuance. See Janecka, 937 S.W.2d at 468. Examples\n\n\n\n                                          90\n\fof specific prejudice are allegations of unfair surprise, inability to effectively cross-\n\nexamine any of the State‘s witnesses, or demonstrating that crucial testimony\n\nwould have been given by a potential witness. Id. There is nothing in the record\n\nshowing the specific facts that a witness would have testified to or what any further\n\ninvestigation would have revealed. Moreover, the trial court instructed defense\n\ncounsel to have their investigator continue his investigation into the matter and\n\nprovide a daily update on the status of the investigation. (RR60: 26). There is no\n\nevidence in the record that any further investigation conducted by the defense\n\nproduced any evidence favorable to Appellant‘s mitigation case. Accordingly,\n\nAppellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion for continuance. Likewise, because the Appellant has failed to establish an\n\nabuse of discretion he has also failed to show that he was denied due process. See\n\nHicks, 633 F.2d at 1148; Nwosoucha, 325 S.W.3d at 828.\n\n      Finally, because the Appellant has not established any specific prejudice as a\n\nresult of the denial of his motion, he is also unable to show that he was denied the\n\neffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of his trial. In order to\n\nshow that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, the Appellant must\n\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) counsel‘s representation fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the results of the proceedings would have been different in the\n\n\n\n                                           91\n\fabsence of counsel‘s errors. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686\n\n(1984); Thompson v. State, 9 S.W.3d 808, 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). Based on\n\nthis record, the Appellant cannot show that the results of the proceedings would\n\nhave been different—that the jury ―would have concluded that the balance of\n\naggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.‖ See Strickland,\n\n466 U.S. at 695; Martinez v. Quarterman, 481 F.3d 249, 254 (5th Cir. 2007)\n\n(applying Strickland standard in Texas death penalty case). Accordingly, this\n\nCourt should overrule Issue 6.\n\n STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 7-10: THE TRIAL COURT DID ERR IN DENYING THE\n                   APPELLANT’S MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS.\n\n      In Issues 7 through 10, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his motions to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to four search\n\nwarrants. Appellant‘s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      On September 8, 2012, three search warrants were issued in this case. At the\n\ntime the warrants were issued, Shania‘s disappearance was being treated as a\n\nkidnapping. (CR2: 168–72, 177–82, 186–95, 200–04). Each of the search warrants\n\ncontained a supporting affidavit alleging the following relevant facts:\n\n             On Thursday, September 6, 2012, Shania Ambriehl Gray was\n      last seen at Hebron High School at 4207 Plano Parkway, Carrollton,\n      Denton County, Texas. She was attending an after school tutoring\n      class and had received a telephone call from her mother. Shania\n      Ambriehl Gray told her teacher that she was going to meet her\n\n                                         92\n\fmother, Sherry James. Shania left the classroom to walk out of the\nschool and meet her mother, who was waiting in a car. Shania\nAmbriehl Gray never arrived at her mother‘s car and has not been\nseen since her tutoring class.\n\n[….]\n\n       Officers discovered that in 2011, Shania Ambriehl Gray had\nreported several Sexual Assault cases to the Mesquite Police\nDepartment. The suspect, Franklin Davis (B/M/01171982), was\narrested and is currently awaiting trial for these offenses. Detective\nWilliams contacted your Affiant, Detective C. Cook #754, to assist\nwith the investigation.\n\n[….]\n\n       Officers obtained Shania Ambriehl Gray‘s cellular telephone\ninformation due to exigent circumstances. While investigating the\nactivity on Shania Ambriehl Gray‘s cellular telephone, officers found\nthe telephone number 903-603-8786. During the time period from\nSeptember 5, 2012 to September 6, 2012, several call and text\nmessages were made from Shania Ambriehl Gray‘s cellular telephone\nto cellular telephone number 903-603-8786.\n\n       Officers obtained the call data for 903-603-8786 due to exigent\ncircumstances. One of the numbers called by 903-603-8786 was 214-\n909-8567. Officers called 214-909-8567 and spoke to Shakeema\nMorsley. Officers asked Shakeema Morsley is she could tell them\nwho had been calling her from 903-603-8786. Shakeema Morsley said\nthat she believed this person was Franklin Davis. Shakeema Morsley\nknows Franklin Davis through her friend and work associate, Jawanna\nArrington, who is in a dating relationship with Franklin Davis.\nShakeema stated that she strongly believed this was Franklin Davis\ndue to the content of the communications, which would only be\nknown to Franklin Davis.\n\n      Officers looked at the cellular telephone data for Shania\nAmbriehl Gray and the 903-603-8786, which is believed to belong to\nFranklin Davis, and found that they had been in proximity with each\nother during the same time frame on September 6, 2012. After 5:17\n\n                                 93\n\f      PM CST on September 6, 2012 it appears that Shania Ambriehl\n      Gray‘s cellular telephone was turned off.\n\n      [….]\n\n(CR2: 169–70, 179–80; 190–91).\n\n      The first warrant was to obtain a sample of the Appellant‘s DNA and to\n\nphotograph his body. (CR2: 168–72). Police took two buccal swabs and multiple\n\nphotographs of the Appellant‘s body pursuant to the warrant. (CR2: 172). The\n\nsecond warrant was to search the 2005 Dodge Stratus registered to the Appellant‘s\n\nwife, which was also driven by the Appellant. (CR2: 177–82). A bank receipt,\n\ntrace evidence, multiple fingerprints, and DNA swabs were taken during the search\n\nof the vehicle. (CR2: 182). The third search warrant was for the Appellant‘s\n\nresidence located at 10223 North MacArthur Boulevard #254, Irving, Texas. (CR2:\n\n186–95). The search of the Appellant‘s residence resulted in the seizure of two\n\nplastic bags containing household trash, a black spiral notebook containing\n\npersonal writings, miscellaneous paperwork, a black Adidas shirt, black basketball\n\nshorts, and a pair of weightlifting gloves. (CR2: 194–95). The clothing and gloves\n\nwere found together in a gray laundry tub. (CR2: 195).          Police also took\n\nphotographs of the residence. (CR2: 194).\n\n      On September 8, 2012, the Appellant was arrested on outstanding traffic\n\nwarrants and was also placed on a forty-eight hour investigative hold. (RR61: 227;\n\nRR62: 39–41; SX: 57, 57B). The complainant‘s body was found that afternoon.\n\n                                       94\n\f(RR62: 73). After confessing to a detective that he had murdered Shania, the\n\nAppellant was arrested for capital murder. (RR62: 112).\n\n      On September 12, 2012, a fourth search warrant was issued to search the\n\ncontents of Appellant‘s T-Mobile My Touch LG-E739 smart phone. (CR2: 200–\n\n04). Analysts were able to access and retrieve the Appellant‘s internet search\n\nhistory, Facebook logins, text messages, and several recorded phone conversations,\n\namong other data. (RR60: 252–70; RR61: 90–92, 135).\n\n      On July 31, 2013, the Appellant filed four pretrial motions to suppress the\n\nevidence. (CR2: 164–204). The Appellant alleged that the facts contained in the\n\naffidavits supporting the warrants were insufficient to establish probable cause.\n\n(CR2: 164–204). A pretrial hearing was held on the Appellant‘s motions on\n\nAugust 30, 2013. (RR57: 60–70).       Neither party called any witnesses at the\n\nhearing. (RR57: 60–70). Instead, defense counsel reiterated their argument from\n\nthe motions. (RR57: 63).\n\n      Counsel attacked the use of information provided to police by Shakeema\n\nMorsley to link the Appellant to the 903-603-8786 phone number (―903 number‖)\n\nwhich, based on cell phone records, had been in communication and in close\n\nproximity to the complainant around the time of her disappearance. (RR57: 61–\n\n63). Defense counsel argued that the police had no prior knowledge of Morsley\n\nand there was nothing to suggest she was credible. (RR57: 61–62). Counsel also\n\n\n\n                                       95\n\fargued that there was no basis for obtaining the Appellant‘s DNA because, at the\n\ntime the warrant was issued, there was nothing to compare the Appellant‘s DNA\n\nto. (RR57: 63, 65). Additionally, counsel argued that there was no evidence to\n\nsuggest that a kidnapping had occurred. (RR57: 65).\n\n      Finally, counsel argued that the fourth warrant, obtained on September 12,\n\n2012, after the first three warrants were executed, was obtained using information\n\nand evidence acquired through the execution of the first three warrants. (RR57:\n\n66). Counsel asserted that because the first three warrants were not valid, the\n\nfourth warrant was tainted. (RR57: 66).\n\n      On September 6, 2013, the trial court issued findings of fact on the four\n\nmotions to suppress. (CR3: 52). The trial court granted the Appellant‘s first\n\nmotion to suppress, in part, excluding the DNA evidence obtained via the two\n\nbuccal swabs. (CR3: 71). The trial court found the affidavit supporting the search\n\nwarrant did not contain probable cause ―as it pertains to these items.‖ (CR3: 71).\n\nHowever, the trial court found that there was probable cause to photograph the\n\nAppellant‘s body, and denied the Appellant‘s motion to suppress the photographs.\n\n(CR3: 71–72). The trial court denied the other three motions to suppress, finding\n\nthat all three affidavits for the search warrants were supported by probable cause.\n\n(CR3: 52–53; 82–83, 97–98).\n\n\n\n\n                                          96\n\f                                   Applicable Law\n\n      The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that ―no\n\nwarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,\n\nand particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be\n\nseized.‖ U.S. CONST. amend. IV. Article 18.01(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure provides that ―[n]o search warrant shall issue for any purpose in this\n\nstate unless sufficient facts are first presented to satisfy the issuing magistrate that\n\nprobable cause does in fact exist for its issuance.‖ Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n18.01(b) (West 2015).\n\n      The search warrant must be supported by a sworn affidavit ―setting forth\n\nsubstantial facts establishing probable cause.‖ Id. Probable cause sufficient to\n\nsupport a search warrant exists if, under the totality of the circumstances presented\n\nto the magistrate, there is a fair probability or substantial chance that contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime will be found at the specified location at the time the warrant is\n\nissued. Bonds v. State, 403 S.W.3d 867, 876 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013); Rodriguez v.\n\nState, 232 S.W.3d 55, 60 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Davis v. State, 202 S.W.3d 149,\n\n154 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006).\n\n      The sufficiency of a search-warrant affidavit is determined by considering\n\nthe totality of the circumstances set forth within the four corners of the affidavit.\n\nMoreno v. State, 415 S.W.3d 284, 287 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). The magistrate\n\n\n\n                                          97\n\fmay interpret the probable cause affidavit in a non-technical, common-sense\n\nmanner and he may draw reasonable inferences from it. See Illinois v. Gates, 462\n\nU.S. 213, 235–38 (1983); State v. McClain, 337 S.W.3d 268, 271 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2011); Davis, 202 S.W.3d at 154; Swearingen v. State, 143 S.W.3d 808, 811(Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2004).      The magistrate is not required to find proof beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, but only a probability that\n\ncontraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. Ford v. State,\n\n179 S.W.3d 203, 212 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. ref‘d).\n\n      An appellate court conducts an independent, or de novo, review of a trial\n\ncourt‘s ruling on a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search\n\nwarrant. Bonds v. State, 403 S.W.3d 867, 873 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). This is\n\nbecause the trial court was not in an appreciably better position than the appellate\n\ncourt to determine whether the magistrate was justified in concluding, based on the\n\ninformation set forth in the affidavit, that a search would uncover evidence of\n\nwrongdoing. See Guzman v. State, 955 S.W.2d 85, 89 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997);\n\nLane v. State, 971 S.W.2d 748, 752 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1998, pet. ref‘d). The\n\nmagistrate‘s finding of probable cause is not, however, reviewed de novo. Bonds,\n\n403 S.W.3d at 873 (citing Swearingen, 143 S.W.3d at 810–11).\n\n      Instead, the appellate court, like the trial court, looks to whether, considering\n\nthe totality of the circumstances, the magistrate had a substantial basis for\n\n\n\n                                          98\n\fconcluding that probable cause existed to support issuance of the search warrant.\n\nSee Gates, 462 U.S. at 236, 238–39; Bonds, 403 S.W.3d at 873; Swearingen, 143\n\nS.W.3d at 811. This deferential standard of review is consistent with the Fourth\n\nAmendment‘s strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant. See\n\nGates, 462 U.S. at 236; Bonds, 403 S.W.3d at 873.\n\n                                       Issue 7\n\n      In Issue 7, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion\n\nto suppress the photographs and DNA taken pursuant to the search warrant because\n\nthe facts contained in the search warrant affidavit were insufficient to establish\n\nprobable cause.\n\n      First, the record reflects that the trial court granted the Appellant‘s motion to\n\nsuppress the DNA obtained from the buccal swabs. (CR3: 71). Accordingly,\n\nAppellant‘s issue is moot. Additionally, Appellant waived any error in the denial\n\nof his motion to suppress the photographs when he stated he had ―no objection‖ to\n\ntheir admission at trial. (RR63: 182, 197–98).\n\n      When a motion to suppress is denied, the defendant does not need to object\n\nto the same evidence at trial in order to preserve error on appeal. Garza v. State,\n\n126 S.W.3d 79, 84 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); Moraguez v. State, 701 S.W.2d 902,\n\n904 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986). However, this Court has held that when a defendant\n\naffirmatively states during trial that he has ―no objection‖ to the admission of the\n\n\n\n                                          99\n\fcomplained-of evidence, he waives any error in the admission of the evidence\n\ndespite the pretrial ruling. Estrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d 274, 302 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 905 (2011); Swain v. State, 181 S.W.3d 359, 368\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2005); Jones v. State, 833 S.W.2d 118, 126 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1992); Moraguez, 701 S.W.2d at 904. However, this Court recently clarified that\n\nthis principle is context-dependent, explaining that if the whole record plainly\n\ndemonstrates the defendant did not intend, and the trial court did not construe, the\n\n―no objection‖ assertion to abandon the earlier preserved complaint, the complaint\n\nis not waived. See Thomas v. State, 408 S.W.3d 877, 885 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nThis Court further explained:\n\n      On the other hand, if from the record as a whole the appellate court\n      simply cannot tell whether an abandonment was intended or\n      understood, then, consistent with prior case law, it should regard the\n      ―no objection‖ statement to be a waiver of the earlier-preserved error.\n      Under     the    latter    circumstances,      the    affirmative    ‗no\n      objection‘ statement will, by itself, serve as an unequivocal indication\n      that a waiver was both intended and understood.\n\nId. at 885–86.\n\n      The record in this case does not plainly demonstrate that the Appellant did\n\nnot intend to waive his complaint, nor does the record reflect that the trial court did\n\nnot construe counsel‘s statement of ―no objection‖ as an abandonment of the\n\ncomplaint. It is clear that counsel reviewed the photographs that were offered into\n\n\n\n\n                                         100\n\fevidence and had no objection to them. (RR63: 182, 197–98).              Accordingly,\n\nAppellant has waived his complaint regarding the photographs.\n\n      Issue 7 should be overruled.\n\n                                   Issues 8 and 9\n\n      In Issues 8 and 9, the Appellant contends that the affidavits in support of the\n\nsearch warrants for the vehicle and residence were insufficient to establish\n\nprobable cause because the only information linking the Appellant to the\n\ndisappearance of the complainant came from an unknown and unreliable source.\n\nThe Appellant argues that the information police obtained from Shakeema Morsley\n\nidentifying him as the individual contacting her from the 903 number should have\n\nbeen treated in the same manner as information obtained from an anonymous\n\ninformant. The Appellant contends that the police had no way of knowing the true\n\nidentity of the person identifying herself as Morsley, and additionally, the\n\ninformation she provided was unreliable.\n\n      Appellant‘s assertion that the information provided by Morsley should have\n\nbeen treated like an anonymous tip is wholly without merit. While ―[t]ips from\n\nanonymous or first-time confidential informants of unknown reliability must be\n\ncoupled with facts from which an inference may be drawn that the informant is\n\ncredible or that his information is reliable,‖ this is not necessary in cases involving\n\ncitizen informants. State v. Duarte, 389 S.W.3d 349, 358 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n\n\n\n                                         101\n\fA ―citizen informant‖ is an average citizen who happens to find himself in the\n\nposition of victim or witness to criminal conduct and thereafter tells the police\n\nwhat he knows as a matter of civic duty. Id. at 356 (quoting 2 Wayne R. Lafave,\n\nSearch and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 3.3 at 98 (4th ed.\n\n2004)). Accordingly, a citizen informant is presumed to speak with the voice of\n\nhonesty and accuracy. Id. at 356–57.\n\n      The information at issue in this case came from a private citizen who was\n\ncontacted by police during the course of their investigation. Morsley was neither\n\nan anonymous informant nor a confidential informant, she was a citizen informant.\n\nThe affidavit reflects that Morsley was contacted by police officers at her 214-909-\n\n8567 number after the officers identified her number as one that had been in\n\ncontact with the 903 number. When officers inquired as to whether she knew the\n\nidentity of the person contacting her from that number, Morsley was willing to\n\nidentify herself to police and provide them with the information they needed.\n\nMorsley was anything but anonymous; in fact, the affidavit contains both her name\n\nand phone number. Accordingly, her identity is readily ascertainable from the\n\nsearch warrant affidavit. Because Morsley was a citizen informant, there was no\n\nneed to establish her basis of knowledge or veracity.\n\n      However, the affidavit does contain the facts necessary to establish\n\nMorsley‘s veracity and basis of knowledge. The affidavit reflects that Morsley\n\n\n\n                                        102\n\fknew the Appellant through Jawanna Arrington, her friend and work associate.\n\nArrington was in a ―dating relationship‖10 with the Appellant. Furthermore, the\n\naffidavit reflects that Morsley believed that the Appellant was the person\n\ncontacting her from the 903 number due to the content of the communications she\n\nreceived, the contents of which would have only been known to the Appellant. To\n\nthe extent that the Appellant challenges the affidavit because it does not contain the\n\nspecific contents of the communications that led Morsley to believe that the\n\nAppellant was the person contacting her, this Court has said that ―[t]he focus is not\n\non what other facts could or should have been included in the affidavit; the focus is\n\non the combined logical force of facts that are in the affidavit.‖ Duarte, 389\n\nS.W.3d at 354–55 (citing Rodriguez v. State, 232 S.W.3d 55, 62 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2007)).\n\n\n10\n   While the Appellant attacks Morsley‘s reliability because the affidavit refers to the Appellant\nand Arrington as being in a ―dating relationship‖ rather than married, it is clear from the record\nthat Morsley was aware that Arrington and the Appellant were married. Following her phone\nconversation with Detective Cook, Morsley went to the Carrollton Police Department and met\nwith Detective Teniente. (DX: 1 at p. 28–31). During her interview with the detective, Morsley\ninformed him that she knew the Appellant because he was married to Arrington, and they were\nmarried in June 2011. (DX: 1 at p. 30).\n        And while this information was not available to the magistrate when he made his\nprobable cause determination, it shows that Morsley knew Appellant and Arrington were\nmarried, and any characterization of their relationship as a ―dating relationship‖ was either an\noversight or misstatement by Detective Cook, rather than a lack of knowledge of the actual status\nof the relationship on the part of Morsley. A misstatement in an affidavit that is the result of\nsimple negligence or inadvertence will not make a search warrant invalid. See Dancy v. State,\n728 S.W.2d 772, 783 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987); Kelly v. State, 413 S.W.3d 164, 174–75 (Tex.\nApp.—Beaumont 2012, no pet.) (citing Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 164–65 (1978)).\nAppellant‘s attack on Morsley‘s reliability and veracity on this basis is without merit.\n\n\n                                               103\n\f      Accordingly, the affidavit contains sufficient facts such that the magistrate\n\ncould have reasonably inferred that the Appellant was associated with the 903\n\nnumber contacting Shania prior to her disappearance, and had been in close\n\nproximity to her when she disappeared.          Thus, viewing the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, Detective Cook‘s affidavit contained sufficient facts and\n\ncircumstances to provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for concluding\n\nthere was a fair probability that a search of the Appellant‘s vehicle and residence\n\nwould uncover evidence related to Shania‘s disappearance. See Gates, 462 U.S. at\n\n236. Consequently, probable cause existed to support the issuance of the search\n\nwarrants.\n\n      Appellant‘s Issues 8 and 9 are, therefore, without merit and this Court\n\nshould overrule them.\n\n                                     Issue 10\n\n      In Issue 10, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress the evidence obtained from his black T-Mobile My Touch LG-\n\nE739 smart phone. Appellant contends that the information used to obtain the\n\nsearch warrant for his smart phone was tainted because it was acquired as a result\n\nof the three searches conducted with the September 8, 2012 search warrants, which\n\nAppellant contends were invalid. Appellant further argues that once the evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                       104\n\ffrom the first three searches is suppressed, it leaves no legally obtained information\n\nto obtain the fourth search warrant.\n\n      Appellant‘s contentions are without merit.    First, as discussed above, the\n\nsupporting affidavits attached to the warrants issued on September 8, 2012 did\n\nestablish probable cause; therefore, any evidence obtained as a result of those\n\nsearches could permissibly have been used to obtain the September 12, 2012\n\nwarrant for the Appellant‘s cell phone. However, it is the State‘s position that\n\nnone of the evidence obtained as a result of those searches was used to obtain the\n\nfourth search warrant.\n\n      The affidavit in support of the search warrant for the Appellant‘s smart\n\nphone stated the following facts:\n\n             Your Affiant, Detective D. Williams #846, is a peace officer\n      under the laws of the State of Texas, and has been employed for the\n      past eighteen years as a peace officer. She is currently assigned to the\n      Criminal Investigation Division where she has investigated crimes\n      against children for the past five years.\n\n            On September 7, 2012 Sherry James reported that her sixteen\n      year old daughter, Shania Gray was missing. James stated that she\n      was to pick up Shania from Hebron High School on September 6,\n      2012 at around 1600 hours. When Shania had not returned home by\n      the next day, James reporter her missing.\n\n            In March 2010 [sic] Gray reported that she was the victim of a\n      felony criminal offense in which Franklin Davis was the suspect.\n      Davis was subsequently arrested for that offense in July of 2011 and\n      was released on bond in August 2011.\n\n\n\n\n                                         105\n\f      On September 7, 2012, Detectives discovered, through cell\nphone records, that Franklin Davis and Shania Gray had been in\ncontact with one another on September 6, 2012. Those records also\nrevealed that Davis‘ and Gray‘s cell phones were in the same areas at\nthe same times including Hebron High School at around 1600 hours\non September 6, 2012.\n\n       On September 8, 2012, Detective Chevallier spoke with\nFranklin Davis at the Carrolton Police Department. Davis was advised\nof his Miranda Warning, which he waived. Davis provided Chevallier\na voluntary oral statement admitting to his involvement in the\ndisappearance of Shania Gray. During the course of the investigation,\nGray voluntarily submitted his personal cell phone, a black T Mobile\nMy Touch LG E-739, serial number 205KPSL357486, for analysis.\n\n      Davis stated that he was able to obtain Gray‘s personal cell\nphone number off of Facebook. Using a false identity, Davis\ncontacted Gray using an AT&T prepaid cell phone, 903-603-8786, but\nhe used his personal cell phone in order to collect evidence about the\nprevious criminal offense that Gray reported in March 2010.\n\n       On September 6, 2012, Davis contacted Gray using his false\nidentity and arranged to meet her at Hebron High School. Davis stated\nthat when arrived at the high school, Gray was surprised to see him.\nGray got into Davis‘ car after he told her that he wanted to talk to her\nabout the March 2010 [sic] criminal case. Davis stated that he drove\nGray to the trail head for Champion Trail at Valley View Lane and IH\n635. Davis stated that during the drive to that location, Gray saw a\n.380 pistol that Davis had in his possession. At one point, Gray asked\nDavis if he was going to hurt her and he replied that he only wanted to\ntalk about the March 2010 [sic] case. Davis told Chevallier that he and\nGray got out of the car and onto the trail and then down toward the\nTrinity River. Davis stated that he used the .380 pistol that he had\nbrought with him to shoot Gray twice. Davis stated that Gray fell\npartially into the river and began asking, ―Why Wish?‖ Wish is a\nnickname that Davis admitting [sic] to using. Davis then reached\ndown and pulled Gray up on to the bank. Davis stated that he then\nstepped on her neck until she stopped breathing.\n\n\n\n\n                                  106\n\f            On September 8, 2012, at about 1630 hours, Irving Police\n      Department responded to a body that was found in the Trinity River\n      near Valley View Lane and IH 635. The female body was wearing the\n      same clothes as Shania Gray was wearing at the time she went\n      missing. Officers located a backpack near the body that contained the\n      school identification of Shania Gray.\n\n             Davis then led Detective to several locations in an attempt to\n      locate evidence. Davis led Detectives to the location where he killed\n      Gray. That location was a short distance upstream from where Davis\n      shot and killed Gray. Davis then led Detectives to a pond at the\n      intersection of Royal Lane and Las Colinas Boulevard where a .380\n      pistol was located where Davis said he threw it.\n\n            Your affiant believes that the black T Mobile My Touch LG-\n      E739 serial number 205KPSL357486, will contain evidence of\n      Franklin Davis communicating with Shania Gray and accessing her\n      Facebook[.]\n\n(CR2: 201–03).\n\n      Though Appellant asserts that evidence obtained pursuant to the previous\n\nthree warrants was used to obtain this warrant, Appellant fails to identify the\n\ncomplained-of evidence. The State asserts that the information contained in the\n\naffidavit was obtained from the Appellant during the interviews he had with\n\ndetectives Williams, Chevallier, Teniente and Griggs. (SX: 57, 57B, 57C).\n\n      The Appellant voluntarily came to the Carrollton Police Department in the\n\nearly morning hours of September 8, 2012.    He agreed to speak to Detective\n\nWilliams concerning Shania‘s disappearance. (RR61: 226–231; SX: 57, 57C).\n\nDuring his initial interview, he denied knowing anything her disappearance.\n\n(RR61: 226–31; RR62: 24–27; SX: 57, 57C). He also denied the sexual assault\n\n                                       107\n\fallegations that were pending and told Williams that Shania had sent him several\n\ntext messages in which she said that she had made up the allegations because her\n\nmother made her. (SX: 57, 57C). The Appellant said the messages were still on his\n\ncell phone, and he offered to show them to Williams. (SX: 57, 57C). After the\n\ninterview, the Appellant was arrested for outstanding traffic warrants from Balch\n\nSprings and was also placed on a forty-eight hour investigative hold. (RR62: 39–\n\n41; SX: 57, 57C).\n\n      When the Appellant requested to speak with detectives a few hours later, the\n\nAppellant told Detective Chevallier and Detective Teniente that he forgot to tell\n\nDetective Williams about recordings he had on his cell phone of conversations he\n\nhad with Shania that would prove that he was innocent of the sexual assaults. (SX:\n\n57, 57B). He continued to deny any involvement in her disappearance. (SX: 57,\n\n57B). During that interview, Shania‘s body was found. (RR62: 73). Subsequently,\n\nthe Appellant agreed to take Chevallier and Griggs to the location where Shania\n\nwas murdered and to show them where he had disposed of the gun, Shania‘s\n\niPhone, and his shoes. (RR62: 78–79; SX: 58).\n\n      On September 9, 2012, the Appellant asked to speak to the detectives, and\n\nhe was subsequently interviewed by Williams and Grigg. (RR62: 117–18; SX: 72,\n\n72A). In that interview, the Appellant provided the detectives with details about\n\nhow he murdered Shania. (SX: 72, 72A). The Appellant told the detectives that he\n\n\n\n                                       108\n\fhad set up a fake Facebook page in order to get information he could use against\n\nShania. (SX: 72, 72A). The Appellant told the detectives he used his T-Mobile\n\nsmart phone to login to Facebook. (SX: 72, 72A). The Appellant admitted that he\n\npurchased a GoPhone from Walmart to contact Shania, and had recorded six or\n\nseven conversations with her on his T-Mobile smart phone. (SX: 72, 72A).\n\n      It was this information, obtained during the Appellant‘s voluntary interviews\n\nwith the detectives, that was alleged in the affidavit supporting the search warrant\n\nfor this cell phone. (CR2: 201–03). None of the items of evidence obtained\n\npursuant to the first three search warrants were used to obtain this warrant.\n\nBecause the Appellant has failed to show that the first three search warrants were\n\ninvalid, and that any evidence obtained from those searches was used to obtain the\n\nwarrant to search his cell phone, Issue 10 should be overruled.\n\n   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 11: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n       SUPPORT THE APPELLANT’S CONVICTION FOR CAPITAL MURDER.\n\n      In Issue 11, Appellant contends the evidence is insufficient to support his\n\nconviction for capital murder because the State failed to present evidence that he\n\nwas in the ―course of committing and attempting to commit obstruction,‖—that the\n\nAppellant‘s motive in murdering Shania was to prevent her future testimony\n\nagainst him in his trial for the four sexual assault offenses. (Appellant‘s Brief at p.\n\n81). Instead, Appellant argues that he murdered Shania because she ruined his life\n\nby lying about the sexual assaults. (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 81). The Appellant\n\n                                         109\n\ffurther argues that because he murdered her out of anger and revenge, he is guilty\n\nonly of first degree murder, not capital murder. (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 86).\n\nContrary to these claims, the evidence is legally sufficient to support the\n\nAppellant‘s conviction for capital murder.\n\n                                 Standard of Review\n\n      When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate\n\ncourt considers all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\n\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319\n\n(1979); Laster v. State, 275 S.W.3d 512, 517 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009). This\n\nstandard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts\n\nin the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from\n\nbasic facts to ultimate facts. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319. The appellate court does\n\nnot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the factfinder. King\n\nv. State, 29 S.W.3d 556, 562 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). In conducting a review,\n\ncircumstantial evidence is as probative as direct evidence in establishing guilt;\n\ncircumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to establish guilt. Clayton v. State,\n\n235 S.W.3d 772, 778 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). In a case involving circumstantial\n\nevidence, ―[e]ach fact need not point directly and independently to the guilt of the\n\nappellant, as long as the cumulative force of all the incriminating circumstances is\n\n\n\n                                          110\n\fsufficient to support the conviction.‖ Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 16–17 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007).\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n      A person commits the offense of capital murder if he intentionally commits\n\nmurder in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of\n\nobstruction. Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 19.03 (a)(2) (West Supp. 2014). A person\n\ncommits obstruction if, he intentionally or knowingly harms or threatens another\n\nby unlawful act to prevent or delay the service of another as a witness, prospective\n\nwitness, or a person who has reported or who the actor knows intends to report the\n\noccurrence of a crime. Tex. Penal Code Ann. § 36.06(a) (West 2015).\n\nSignificantly, a ―prospective witness‖ is ―any person who may testify in an official\n\nproceeding,‖ and the term includes a person who has been involved in an offense\n\nwith a defendant. Ortiz v. State, 93 S.W.3d 79, 86 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002) (quoting\n\nMorrow v. State, 862 S.W.2d 612, 614 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993)).\n\n                                    Application\n\n      Contrary to the Appellant‘s assertions, the record is replete with evidence\n\nshowing that the Appellant‘s motive for murdering Shania was to prevent her from\n\ntestifying against him at his upcoming sexual assault trial. In fact, the evidence\n\nrevealed that the Appellant adopted an elaborate scheme in an effort to influence\n\n\n\n\n                                        111\n\fthe upcoming trial, and when he was ultimately unable to get the results he desired,\n\nthe Appellant eliminated Shania as a witness.\n\n      The evidence showed that in April 2011 Shania made an outcry of sexual\n\nassault, telling her mother that the Appellant had assaulted her while she was\n\nbabysitting his daughter and two other children. As a result of that admission, the\n\nAppellant was indicted on four counts of sexual assault of a child in August 2011.\n\n      On July 24, 2012, the Appellant had a court setting for the sexual assault\n\ncases. (SX: 20 at p. 1). Roughly one week before that court date, the Appellant\n\nconducted multiple Google searches concerning the legality of recording phone\n\nconversations and using them as evidence in court. (SX: 43, 44). The Appellant\n\nalso searched Google for the ―best way to get off of a sexual assault charge.‖ (SX:\n\n44). Six minutes after that query, the Appellant conducted another Google search,\n\nthis time for: ―With no proof that you did the murder can you still be held in jail‖.\n\n(SX: 44).\n\n      At approximately the same time, the Appellant began to look for Shania on\n\nMySpace and Facebook.        However, Shania‘s MySpace page was no longer\n\nupdated, and her Facebook page was private. The Appellant began to look for\n\nways to access her account. First, he created a fake Facebook profile under the\n\nname Jazmine Brown and tried to communicate with Shania. Shania, however, did\n\nnot accept the friend request from Jazmine. Next, the Appellant contacted his\n\n\n\n                                        112\n\fnephew Domee Elkins for access to his Facebook page. The Appellant chose\n\nElkins because he was young and handsome. The Appellant sent Shania a friend\n\nrequest under Elkins‘ profile, and she accepted.\n\n      As a result, the Appellant was able to gain access to Shania‘s Facebook page\n\nand found her phone number. The Appellant then contacted her by text message\n\nusing the ―throwaway phone‖ he purchased at Walmart. The Appellant told her he\n\nwas a relative of Elkins, and had seen her Facebook page because she was\n\n―friends‖ with Elkins. The Appellant told her his name was Artis Powell and he\n\nwas interested in getting to know her. The Appellant told Shania his middle name\n\nwas Dwayne, and he went by ―D.‖ The Appellant had previously looked for a\n\nFacebook profile belonging to someone that looked similar to him in appearance,\n\nand had decided on Artis Powell. Shania immediately sent a text message back,\n\nand he told her if she wanted to see what he looked like, she should visit Powell‘s\n\nFacebook page. Earlier that evening, the Appellant sent Powell a message from\n\nthe Jazmine Brown Facebook page, warning Powell not to respond to any\n\nmessages from Shania because she was underage.\n\n      On July 17, 18, and 19, the Appellant called Shania on the ―throwaway‖\n\nphone, pretending to be ―D.‖ The Appellant recorded the conversations with his T-\n\nMobile smart phone and attempted to elicit statements from Shania that were\n\ninconsistent with the statements she made to police during the sexual assault\n\n\n\n                                        113\n\finvestigation. The Appellant also attempted to gain information he could use to\n\nimpeach her credibility at trial and attack her character. Specifically, the Appellant\n\nasked her to tell him about her previous sexual relationships. The Appellant also\n\nattempted to manipulate Shania into not testifying by suggesting that she could go\n\nto prison if she was caught lying about the sexual assaults, and further suggested\n\nthat she could be in danger if she testified at trial because the man she made the\n\nallegations against might hold a grudge against her if he went to prison and might\n\ncome after her when he was released. When Shania told him that she just wanted\n\neverything ―over and done with‖ the Appellant suggest that she tell the police she\n\nlied and then the charges would be dropped. (SX: 19, 19C). The Appellant assured\n\nher that she would not get in trouble because she was a minor. Shania never\n\nrecanted the allegations.\n\n      In August 2012, the Appellant was notified that his trial was set for October\n\n29, 2012. On August 27, 2012, the Appellant downloaded an application onto his\n\nT-Mobile smart phone called ―Fake Call & SMS & Call Log.‖ The application\n\npermitted the user to create fake text messages and call logs. Thirty minutes after\n\ninstalling the application, the Appellant created three fake text messages purporting\n\nto be from Shania. The second message stated: ―Sorry I li3d on u but my momma\n\nmad3 m3 do it. If we go to court ima t3ll th3m u never touched me. My my\n\nmomma go b3 mad @ m3 but fuck that bitch I can‘t stand her no ways. Please\n\n\n\n                                         114\n\f4give me.‖ (SX: 43). Three minutes after creating the fake text messages, the\n\nAppellant called his attorney Hugo Aguilar. (SX: 43). The following day, the\n\nAppellant created three more text messages also purporting to be from Shania. He\n\nalso created an incoming call log, to make it appear that Shania had called him.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, the Appellant purchased a Diamondback .380 handgun and\n\nreinitiated contact with Shania under his false identity. The two agreed to meet\n\nafter school on September 6, 2012.\n\n      The Appellant testified that Shania was scared when she came out of her\n\nschool to meet ―D‖ but and saw him. Instead, the Appellant testified that he did\n\nnot have the gun out at the time, but claimed that Shania agreed to get in the car\n\nwith him. The Appellant testified that he told her he wanted to talk to her about\n\nthe sexual assault allegations. Once she was in the car, the Appellant drove to Sam\n\nHouston Trail Park.     Once there the Appellant made Shania walk down an\n\nembankment to the Trinity River, where he shot her twice and stood on her throat\n\nuntil she stopped breathing. He then rolled her body into the river and left the park\n\nto dispose of the evidence.\n\n      When he was questioned by detectives with the Carrollton Police\n\nDepartment, the Appellant denied any involvement in Shania‘s disappearance and\n\ntold the police that he was innocent of the sexual assault charges. The Appellant\n\ntold them that Shania had sent him text messages recanting the allegations. Even\n\n\n\n                                        115\n\fafter confessing to Shania‘s murder, the Appellant still relied on the text messages,\n\nnever once admitting that they were fake.\n\n      The elaborate nature and timing of the Appellant‘s scheme support the\n\nconclusion that the Appellant was trying to influence the upcoming trial. The jury\n\ncould have rationally concluded that when the Appellant was ultimately unable to\n\nmanipulate Shania into recanting the allegations or gain the information he was\n\nlooking for, he eliminated her as a witness. While the Appellant claimed he\n\nmurdered her for revenge, the jury was certainly free to reject the Appellant‘s\n\ntestimony. Lancon v. State, 253 S.W.3d 699, 707 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)) (―[T]he\n\ntrier of fact is the sole judge of the witnesses‘ credibility and is free to accept or\n\nreject any or all of the evidence presented by either side.‖).        The Appellant\n\nadmittedly lied throughout the investigation, and in fact, never told anyone that the\n\ntext messages from Shania were fake until he was confronted with the results of\n\nthe forensic examination of his phone.         The Appellant even testified that he\n\nintended to use them as evidence at the trial knowing they were fake.\n\n      Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury‘s verdict,\n\na rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of capital murder\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the evidence is legally sufficient to support\n\nthe conviction. The State asks this Court to overrule Issue 11.\n\n\n\n\n                                         116\n\fSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 12: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN OVERRULING\n   THE APPELLANT’S OBJECTION TO STATE’S EXHIBIT NUMBERS 40 AND 41.\n\n      In Issue 12, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nRule 403 objection to State‘s Exhibits 40 and 41, two photographs depicting the\n\nvictim‘s body at the crime scene. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 91–94). Appellant‘s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                 Pertinent Facts\n\n      During the testimony of Farmers Branch Police Officer Austin Tapp at\n\nAppellant‘s trial, the State offered State‘s Exhibits 38 through 41, photographs\n\ndepicting the terrain where Shania‘s body was found and the condition of her body\n\nfloating in the river. (RR61: 115–20). While defense counsel did not object to the\n\nadmission of State‘s Exhibits 38 and 39, counsel objected to the admission of\n\nState‘s Exhibits 40 and 41. (RR61: 116). Specifically, defense counsel argued:\n\n      MR. HAYES: Your Honor, we have no objection to State‘s Exhibits\n      38 and 39. I believe that they do show the terrain which the State is\n      attempting to get at.\n\n      40 and 41, we do object to. I don‘t – they‘re pictures of the body\n      floating in the river. I don‘t believe that there‘s a probative value\n      added to the testimony at this time. I simply believe it‘s a prejudicial\n      photograph and it doesn‘t really seem to add anything to the\n      testimony, the terrain or the environment.\n\n      I‘d ask the Court to take a look at them and do a 403 balancing test on\n      40 and 41, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n\n                                        117\n\f(RR61: 116).      After reviewing the challenged photographs, the trial court\n\nconcluded that the probative value of State‘s Exhibits 40 and 41 substantially\n\noutweighed the prejudicial effect, overruled the objection, and admitted the\n\nphotographs into evidence. (RR61: 116–17).\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n      A trial court‘s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. See Weatherred v. State, 15 S.W.3d 540, 542 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2000). The trial court‘s ruling should be upheld if it is within the zone\n\nof reasonable disagreement. Id. And, it will be upheld if it is correct on any theory\n\nof law applicable to the case. Romero v. State, 800 S.W.2d 539, 543 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1990).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The admissibility of a photograph is within the sound discretion of the trial\n\njudge. Paredes v. State, 129 S.W.3d 530, 539 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); Williams v.\n\nState, 958 S.W.2d 186, 195 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). Generally, a photograph is\n\nadmissible if verbal testimony about the subject of the photograph is also\n\nadmissible. Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 762 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (holding\n\nthat, if verbal testimony is relevant, photographs of the same are also relevant).\n\n      The admissibility of photographic evidence alleged to be unduly prejudicial\n\nis governed by Texas Rule of Evidence 403. Tex. R. Evid. 403; Emery v. State, 881\n\n\n\n                                         118\n\fS.W.2d 702, 710 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Under Rule 403, all relevant evidence is\n\nadmissible unless ―its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\n\nconsiderations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.‖\n\nTex. R. Evid. 403.\n\n      In performing a Rule 403 analysis, ―the trial court must consider the host of\n\nfactors affecting probativeness . . . and balance those factors against the tendency,\n\nif any, that the photographs have to encourage resolution of material issues on an\n\ninappropriate emotional basis.‖ Ladd v. State, 3 S.W.3d 547, 568 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1999). Relevant factors a court may consider in making this determination include\n\nthe number of exhibits offered, their gruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether\n\nthey are black-and-white or color, whether they are close-up, whether the body is\n\nnaked or clothed, the availability of other means of proof, and other circumstances\n\nunique to the individual case. Chamberlain v. State, 998 S.W.2d 230, 237 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1999).\n\n      All probative evidence proffered by an adverse party will be prejudicial, but\n\nonly unfair prejudice warrants exclusion of the evidence. See Montgomery v. State,\n\n810 S.W.2d 372, 378 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990) (citing United States v. Figueroa,\n\n618 F.2d 934, 943 (2nd Cir. 1980)).\n\n\n\n\n                                        119\n\f                                    Application\n\n       Here, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the photographs\n\nbecause they were extremely gruesome and were offered to appeal to the emotion\n\nof the jury rather than to aid in the fact finding process. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp.\n\n93–94). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nphotographs.\n\n       State‘s Exhibits 40 and 41 are two color photographs measuring 8 ½ by 11\n\ninches. The photographs depict Shania‘s clothed body floating face-down in the\n\nTrinity River. The photographs were admitted during the testimony of Officer\n\nTapp, the first officer to arrive at the crime scene. (RR61: 108–13). Officer Tapp\n\ntestified that he was on bike patrol on the afternoon of September 6, 2012, when he\n\nreceived a call from dispatch sending him to investigate a possible person floating\n\nin the Trinity River near the intersection of Interstate 635 and Valley View Lane.\n\n(RR61: 109–10). When Officer Tapp arrived at the location, he observed a body in\n\nthe water that did not appear to be moving. (RR61: 110). Once Officer Tapp was\n\nable to climb down the steep embankment to the river, he was able to see that the\n\nbody was a female with a wound to the lower left side of her back. (RR61: 111–\n\n12).\n\n       State‘s Exhibits 38, 39, 40, and 41 were used by Officer Tapp to help the\n\njury understand the crime scene‘s difficult terrain as well as the condition of\n\n\n\n                                         120\n\fShania‘s body when it was found. (RR61: 118–21). State‘s Exhibit 40 shows\n\nShania‘s clothed body floating face-down in the river. (SX: 40). The back of her t-\n\nshirt is slightly raised and a wound is visible to her lower back. (SX: 40). Officer\n\nTapp noted that he was able to determine the body belonged to a female because of\n\nthe braided hair, but was unable to determine an approximate age because the body\n\nhad ―swelled up‖ from being in the water. (RR61: 119–20). Officer Tapp noted\n\nthat he noticed the wound to her back because of ―bubbles‖ forming in the area of\n\nthe wound and fly activity. (RR61: 120). State‘s Exhibit 41 is a closer view of\n\nShania‘s body and its position in the water, and the wound to her back is more\n\nvisible. (SX: 41). Officer Tapp used the photographs to point out the wound.\n\n(RR61: 120).\n\n      While gruesome, the photographs are not unduly so, and are relevant\n\nbecause they accurately reflect the location and state of Shania‘s body when it was\n\ndiscovered, as well as the injuries inflicted on it. See Ripkowski v. State, 61 S.W.3d\n\n378, 392 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); see also Shuffield v. State, 189 S.W.3d 782, 788\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2006). Such depictions give the photos substantial probative\n\nvalue. Ripkowski, 61 S.W.3d at 382. Accordingly, the photographs in question\n\nwere probative of the crime scene and the injuries received by the victim and were\n\nnecessary for the State to develop its case. Consequently, the probative value of\n\nthe photographs was not substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect and\n\n\n\n                                         121\n\fthus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photographs. See\n\nShuffield v. State, 189 S.W.3d 782, 787–88 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (holding that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting crime-scene photographs\n\nwhere they were probative of the crime scene and injuries received by the victim,\n\nwere necessary in developing the State‘s case, and were not overly gruesome);\n\nLadd, 3 S.W.3d at 568 (holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting ten photographs of the victim‘s body, including autopsy photos, because\n\nthe photographs depicted the manner of death and were no more gruesome than the\n\ncrime); Long v. State, 823 S.W.2d 259, 273 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (holding that\n\nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting thirteen photographs of the\n\nvictims‘ bodies at the crime scene because the photographs were limited in\n\nnumber, reflected the manner of death, and had to be viewed together to get an\n\naccurate assessment of the injuries sustained by the victims).\n\n      Issue 12 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n           STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, AND 18:\n  THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN SUSTAINING THE STATE’S OBJECTIONS TO\n                  DEFENSE EXHIBITS A, B, C, E, F AND G.\n\n      In Issues 13 through 18, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\nsustaining the State‘s objections to the admission of Defense Exhibits A, B, C, E,\n\nF, and G, six recordings the Appellant made of phone conversations he had with\n\nthe complainant while pretending to be ―D.‖            The State understands the\n\n\n\n                                         122\n\fAppellant‘s argument to be that the trial court erred in excluding the recordings\n\nbecause they were offered to explain the circumstances surrounding the murder,\n\nunder Article 38.36 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and were not hearsay.\n\n(Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 101–03).\n\n                                     Relevant Facts\n\n      During the testimony of Detective Williams, defense counsel offered seven\n\naudio recordings of phone conversations the Appellant had with Shania while\n\npretending to be ―D,‖ the false persona the Appellant created to communicate with\n\nShania. (RR63: 97). The State objected to the admission of the recordings, and a\n\nhearing was held outside the presence of the jury. (RR63: 97–113). At the hearing,\n\nthe State informed the trial court about the contents of each recording and\n\npresented its objections to each of the seven recordings individually. (RR63: 97–\n\n113). The recordings were identified as Defense Exhibits A through G. (RR63:\n\n102–13).\n\n      Defense Exhibit A contained a ten second recording of the Appellant\n\nstating: ―Okay, I‘m going to call her right now to prove my innocence.‖ (RR63:\n\n102). The call, however, goes directly to Shania‘s voicemail. (RR63: 102). The\n\nState raised hearsay and Rule 403 objections. (RR63: 102). Defense counsel\n\noffered no theory of admissibility or response to the State‘s objections. (RR63:\n\n102). The trial court sustained the State‘s objections. (RR63: 102).\n\n\n\n                                          123\n\f       Defense Exhibit B contained a conversation, lasting approximately ten\n\nminutes, in which Shania told ―D‖ about previous boyfriends and about an incident\n\nin which her mother caught her having sex. (RR63: 102–03). The State raised\n\nrelevancy, hearsay and Rule 412 objections. (RR63: 103).                  Defense counsel\n\nresponded that the recording went to the complainant‘s state of mind and supported\n\nthe Appellant‘s theory of the case. (RR63: 103). The trial court sustained the\n\nState‘s objections. (RR63: 104).\n\n       Defense Exhibit C contains a conversation, lasting approximately ten\n\nminutes, in which Shania told ―D‖ about the first time she had sex and about other\n\nsexual relationships. (RR63: 104). The State raised hearsay, Rule 403 and Rule\n\n412 objections. (RR62: 105). Defense counsel argued that the recording was\n\noffered to impeach previous statements made by Shania concerning her sexual\n\nhistory. (RR63: 105). The State countered by stating that there was no evidence\n\npresently before the jury that this recording would contradict. (RR63: 106).\n\n       Defense Exhibit D11 was a five second unintelligible recording. (RR63:\n\n106). The State raised a relevancy objection to the recording, and defense counsel\n\nresponded that they had ―no objection.‖ (RR63: 106). The trial court sustained the\n\nState‘s objection. (RR3: 106).\n\n\n\n11\n  Appellant does not complain about the exclusion of Defense Exhibit D on appeal. (Appellant‘s\nBrief at p. 95).\n\n\n                                             124\n\f        In Defense Exhibit E, ―D‖ asks Shania to tell him ―a big secret,‖ which she\n\nrefuses. (RR63: 106). ―D‖ and Shania also discuss their height and weight and his\n\ncar. (RR63: 107). The State raised Rule 403 and Rule 412 objections to the\n\nrecording. (RR63: 107). Defense counsel reasserted their previous theories of\n\nadmissibility that the recording was offered for purposes of impeaching statements\n\nmade by Shania in the DCAC interview, in the REACH Clinic report, and in the\n\nMesquite Police Department report. (RR63: 107). The State responded that there\n\nhad not been any presentation of evidence from the REACH exam or from the\n\nDCAC interview. (RR63: 108–09). The State noted that the only mention of the\n\nDCAC interview occurred during defense counsel‘s cross-examination of the\n\npolice officers and they could not use that cross-examination to ―open their own\n\ndoor.‖ (RR63: 108–09). The trial court sustained the State‘s objections. (RR63:\n\n109).\n\n        Defense Exhibit F contains a conversation about Shania babysitting her\n\nbrother, her involvement in church activities, and ―D‘s‖ car. (RR63: 110). The\n\nState raised hearsay and relevancy objections. (RR63: 109–11). Defense counsel\n\nresponded that the recording should be admitted under the rule of optional\n\ncompleteness. (RR63: 111).       The trial court sustained the State‘s objections.\n\n(RR63: 111).\n\n\n\n\n                                        125\n\f      Defense Exhibit G contains a conversation about an audition Shania was\n\npreparing for. (RR63: 112). Shania sings on the recording. (RR63: 112). The\n\nState raised hearsay and relevancy objections. (RR63: 113). Defense counsel re-\n\nurged their previous arguments for the admissibility of the recordings. (RR63:\n\n112). The trial court sustained the State‘s objections. (RR63: 112).\n\n      Defense Exhibits A through G were admitted for record purposes. (RR63:\n\n112–13).\n\n                               Preservation of Error\n\n      Appellant‘s complaint is not preserved for this Court‘s review. This Court\n\nhas held, and the rules of evidence make it clear, that in order to preserve error in\n\nthe exclusion of evidence, the proponent is required to make an offer of proof and\n\nobtain a ruling. Reyna v. State, 168 S.W.3d 173, 176 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005);\n\nWilliams v. State, 937 S.W.2d 479, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Tex. R. Evid.\n\n103(a)(2). In some cases, another notion of preservation comes into play, known\n\nas ―party responsibility.‖ Reyna, 168 S.W.3d at 176–77 (finding that the defendant\n\nwas responsible for informing the court of a constitutional basis for the admission\n\nof evidence he sponsored; his evidentiary argument did not preserve the\n\nconstitutional error). The basis for party responsibility is Appellate Rule 33.1. Id.\n\nat 177; Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. The rule provides that as a prerequisite to presenting\n\na complaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party ―stated the\n\n\n\n                                        126\n\fgrounds for the ruling that [he] sought from the trial court with sufficient\n\nspecificity to make the trial court aware of the complaint.‖ Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a)(1). This means that it is not enough for the proponent of the evidence to\n\ntell the court that the evidence is admissible, but the proponent must have told the\n\ncourt why the evidence was admissible. Reyna, 168 S.W.3d at 177.\n\n        While a reviewing court may uphold a trial court‘s ruling on the admission\n\nor exclusion of evidence on any legal theory or basis application to the case, it may\n\nnot reverse a trial court‘s ruling on any theory or basis that might have been\n\napplicable but was not raised at trial. Martinez v. State, 91 S.W.3d 331, 336 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2002). Additionally, the issue on appeal must comport with the\n\ncomplaint made at trial; otherwise, the appellant has preserved nothing for review.\n\nSee Tex. R. App. P. 33.1; Pena v. State, 285 S.W.3d 459, 464 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2009) (concluding that complaint on appeal must comport with the complaint made\n\nat trial).\n\n        First and foremost, the Appellant did not raise Article 38.36 as a basis for\n\nthe admission of the recordings at trial, in fact, he never mentioned the statute.\n\n(RR63: 96–97, 101–13).         Instead, the Appellant vaguely asserted that the\n\nrecordings were admissible, not for the truth of the matter asserted, but were\n\noffered: (1) to show the complainant‘s state of mind concerning sexual activity; (2)\n\nto impeach the complainant‘s credibility concerning statements she made in her\n\n\n\n                                         127\n\fDCAC interview, in the REACH examination, and in her interview with the\n\nMesquite Police Department; and (3) under the rule of optional completeness.\n\n(RR63: 102–13). Accordingly, Appellant has failed to preserve his complaint for\n\nreview. See Darnes v. State, 118 S.W.3d 916, 919 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003,\n\npet. ref‘d) (holding appellant‘s complaint that the evidence was admissible\n\npursuant to Article 38.36 was not preserved for appellate review where appellant\n\nnever mentioned the statutes as a ground for supporting the admission of the\n\nevidence).\n\n      In any event, the trial court‘s rulings in this case were proper.\n\n                     Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      A trial court‘s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is reviewed under an\n\nabuse of discretion standard. Weatherred, 15 S.W.3d at 542; Martinez v. State, 327\n\nS.W.3d 727, 736 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). A trial court has broad discretion in its\n\ndecision to admit or exclude evidence, which should not be disturbed if within the\n\nreasonable zone of disagreement. Guzman, 955 S.W.2d at 89.         The mere fact that\n\na trial court may decide a matter within its discretionary authority differently than\n\nan appellate judge in similar circumstances does not demonstrate an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 379–80. Rather, an abuse of discretion is\n\nshown when the trial court‘s ruling is ―arbitrary or unreasonable,‖ made ―without\n\nreference to any guiding rules or principles.‖ Id.\n\n\n\n                                         128\n\f      The proponent of evidence ordinarily has the burden of establishing the\n\nadmissibility of the proffered evidence. See Marquez v. State, 921 S.W.2d 217,\n\n222–23 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996); Vinson v. State, 252 S.W.3d 336, 340 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008). If no objection is made, the evidence is generally deemed\n\nadmissible. Vinson, 252 S.W.3d at 340. However, once an objection is made, the\n\nproponent must demonstrate that the proffered evidence overcomes the stated\n\nobjection. Id. (citing Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805, 816 (1990)).\n\n      Article 38.36(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows, in all\n\nprosecutions for murder, either party ―to offer testimony as to all relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances surrounding the killing and the previous relationship existing\n\nbetween the accused and the deceased, together with all relevant facts and\n\ncircumstances going to show the condition of the mind of the accused at the time\n\nof the offense.‖ Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.36(a) (West 2005). Evidence\n\nthat is admissible under Article 38.36 is still subject to the limitations provided by\n\nthe Texas Rules of Evidence. See Garcia v. State, 201 S.W.3d 695, 702–05 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2006); Smith v. State, 5 S.W.3d 673, 679 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n\n      Hearsay is defined as ―a statement, other than one made by the declarant\n\nwhile testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted.‖ Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). The matter asserted is defined as ―any\n\nmatter explicitly asserted, and any matter implied by a statement, if the probative\n\n\n\n                                         129\n\fvalue of the statement as offered flows from declarant‘s belief as to the matter.‖\n\nTex. R. Evid. 801(c). Hearsay statements are not admissible except as provided by\n\nstatute or by the rules of evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 802.\n\n                                    Application\n\n      As noted above, evidence that is offered under Article 38.36 must still meet\n\nthe admissibility requirements of the Texas Rules of Evidence. Garcia, 201\n\nS.W.3d at 702–05; Smith, 5 S.W.3d at 679. Therefore, even if the recordings were\n\nadmissible under Article 38.36, which the State does not concede, the recordings\n\nwere properly excluded as hearsay. The Appellant has failed to identify any\n\nexception to the hearsay rule which would have permitted the admission of the\n\nrecordings of Shania telling the Appellant about her church activities, babysitting,\n\nor singing.     These recordings were not excited utterances, present sense\n\nimpressions or statements of Shania‘s state of mind. See Tex. R. Evid. 803.\n\n      While the Appellant argues that the recordings of Shania discussing her past\n\nsexual relationships were admissible under the ―state of mind‖ exception to the\n\nhearsay rule, this claim is without merit. The ―state of mind‖ exception creates an\n\nexception to the hearsay rule for a ―statement of the declarant‘s then existing state\n\nof mind . . . but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact\n\nremembered or believed . . . .‖ Tex. R. Evid. 803(3). The statements made by\n\nShania about her past sexual relationships were descriptions of past events—of\n\n\n\n                                         130\n\ffacts remembered. These types of statement are specifically excluded from the\n\nstate of mind exception. Tex. R. Evid. 803(3); see Glover v. State, 102 S.W.3d 754,\n\n762–63 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2002, no pet.). Consequently, the statements were\n\nnot admissible under the state of mind exception.\n\n      Moreover, it is clear that the Appellant offered the recordings for the express\n\npurpose of disparaging Shania‘s character in front of the jury. He wanted to call\n\nattention to the fact that Shania had sexual relationships with other men prior to the\n\nsexual assaults. The trial court properly excluded the recordings.\n\n      Regardless, the Appellant suffered no harm from the court‘s exclusion of the\n\nrecordings. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). The record reflects that Appellant testified\n\nabout the contents of the recordings on cross-examination:\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. So now we talk about these seven text\n      messages -- or these seven voice recordings. The first one just goes to\n      voice mail. It‘s just the phone ringing?\n\n      APPELLANT: Right.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. So tell these folks why it‘s so important\n      when you we‘re talking about how there‘s seven phone recordings and\n      I‘m hiding stuff, what‘s so important about that?\n\n      APPELLANT: Nothing on -- about that one.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: But that isn‘t what you told these folks.\n\n      APPELLANT: I told them that it was a few text messages -- I mean a\n      few recordings that don‘t prove anything, it‘s just her voice mail. It\n      was one where I was saying I‘m -- this is my name, whatever the –\n      I‘m fixing to prove my innocence in sexual assault charges.\n\n                                         131\n\fMR. BIRMINGHAM: And that‘s all it says?\n\nAPPELLANT: On those two or maybe three of them, yes.\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. So when y‘all throw the number around\nlike there‘s six or seven, there‘s about really three, right?\n\nAPPELLANT: But it was a total of six or seven that was on the\nphone.\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: Here‘s the bombshell, right, here‘s the\nbombshell that you were so desperate to get out: Shania snuck off\nwith a boy and had sex with him and got caught by her mother, right?\n\nAPPELLANT: At what point? Which one are you talking about?\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: The one where she was supposed to be at the\ntrack meet. Do you recall that?\n\nAPPELLANT: I recall that she did not get caught by her mom, she\nactually got -- they got pulled over after they was on the way back to\nthe school.\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: And the deal is that the police were right there,\nand Shania‘s mom eventually found out about that. She told you that,\nright?\n\n[…]\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. The other thing that‘s on there is that\nthis other one is, you know, she had sex with a guy that was in the\nArmy that was 20 years old.\n\nAPPELLANT: The same guy that I actually spoke to when I went to -\n- when I first got arrested on the sexual assault charges and I told\nDetective Snyder then that she had made a mention about a guy that\nshe had sex with that was in the Army. She told me she had sex when\nshe was 13 years old.\n\n\n\n                                 132\n\f      MR. BIRMINGHAM: So that, that is what you want this jury so\n      desperately to hear --\n\n      APPELLANT: That‘s the --\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: -- that Shania had sex with somebody while\n      she was supposed to be at a track meet and that she had sex with a\n      dude that was in the Army -- supposedly in the Army who was about\n      20 years old, right?\n\n      APPELLANT: The one at the track meet, no; but the one about the\n      guy at -- the Army guy, yes.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. You also talked to her whenever you‘re\n      -- in the video -- in the audio recording that we do have, these tactics\n      that you have with her, you‘re –you can see what you‘re trying to do\n      as far as building character evidence. That‘s why you tell her, ―Hey, I\n      guess it‘s good then that you weren‘t a virgin because that‘s a grown-\n      ass man‘s penis.‖\n\n      APPELLANT: Sounds about right.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yeah. Those are your words.\n\n      APPELLANT: Yeah, that‘s what I‘m saying. Sounds about what I\n      said.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Because you‘re trying to get her to admit that\n      she wasn‘t a virgin, right?\n\n      APPELLANT: Pretty much, yeah.\n\n(RR65: 130–35). Accordingly, the same or essentially the same evidence was\n\nplaced in front of the jury. This Court should overrule Issues 13 through 18.\n\n\n\n\n                                        133\n\f     STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 19, 20, 21: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\n      SUSTAINING THE STATE’S OBJECTION TO THE PROFFERED TESTIMONY OF\n                                                   12\n     DEFENSE WITNESSES ARTY HAYES, ASHLYE SAMS AND LAMAR LEGGITON.\n\n        In Issues 19, 20, and 21, the Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\nsustaining the State‘s objections to the proffered testimony of defense witnesses\n\nArty Hayes, Ashlye Sams, and Lamar Leggiton. The Appellant contends that all\n\nthree witnesses should have been permitted to testify concerning statements the\n\nAppellant made to each of them in which he denied sexually assaulting Shania\n\nGray. The Appellant contends the statements were not hearsay because they were\n\nadmissible under Rule 801(e)(1)(B) as the Appellant‘s prior consistent statements.\n\nAppellant‘s contentions are without merit and these three issues should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                                      Applicable Law\n\n        Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying\n\nat trial, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Tex. R. Evid.\n\n801(d). Hearsay statements are not admissible except as provided by statute or by\n\nthe rules of evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 802. Generally, a witness‘s prior statement\n\nthat is consistent with the witness‘s trial testimony is inadmissible hearsay. Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 613(c). However, a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies at the\n\ntrial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the\n\n12\n  In his brief, the Appellant cites to the name ―Ashley Sims;‖ however, the record reflects the\ncorrect spelling of this witness‘s name to be ―Ashlye Sams.‖\n\n\n                                             134\n\fstatement is consistent with the declarant‘s testimony and is offered to rebut an\n\nexpress or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication, improper\n\ninfluence, or motive. Tex. R. Evid. 801(e)(1)(B). The United States Supreme\n\nCourt has set out, and this Court has approved, four requirements that must be met\n\nfor prior consistent statements to be admissible:\n\n      (1)    the declarant must testify at trial and be subject to cross-\n             examination;\n      (2)    there must be an express or implied charge of recent fabrication\n             or improper influence or motive of the declarant‘s testimony by\n             the opponent;\n      (3)    the proponent must offer a prior statement that is consistent\n             with the declarant‘s challenged in-court testimony; and,\n      (4)    the prior consistent statement must be made prior to the time\n             that the supposed motive to falsify arose.\nHammons v. State, 239 S.W.3d 798, 804 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (citing Tome v.\n\nUnited States, 513 U.S. 150,156–58 (1995)).\n\n      Rule 801(e)(1)(B) sets out a minimal foundation requirement of an implied\n\nor express charge of fabrication or improper motive, such that even an attack upon\n\nthe accuracy of the witness‘s memory might suffice to permit the introduction of a\n\nprior consistent statement. Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at 804. However, the rule\n\ncannot be construed to permit the admission of what would otherwise be hearsay\n\nany time a witness‘s credibility or memory is challenged. Id. at 805.\n\n      The rationale for Rule 801(e)(1)(B) is relevancy. Haughton v. State, 805\n\nS.W.2d 405, 408 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990).             A declarant‘s prior consistent\n\n\n                                         135\n\fstatements are relevant to his credibility only when the prior statements were made\n\nprior to the time the supposed motive to falsify arose. Id.; see also Hammons, 239\n\nS.W.3d at 804; Johnson v. State, 208 S.W.3d 478, 504 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006,\n\npet. ref‘d). A prior statement that is made after the motive to falsify arose lacks\n\ntrustworthiness and is not relevant to the declarant‘s credibility at trial.      See\n\ngenerally Haughton, 805 S.W.2d at 408. Such a statement does not rebut the\n\ncharge of recent fabrication. Johnson, 208 S.W.3d at 504.\n\n      The trial court has substantial discretion to admit prior consistent statements\n\nunder the rule. Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at 805. The trial court‘s ruling that a prior\n\nconsistent statement is inadmissible is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\n                               Issue 19: Arty Hayes\n\n      Before the defense called Arty Hayes to testify, the following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n      THE COURT: Mr. Wyatt, this is your witness, correct?\n\n      MR. WYATT: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n      THE COURT: Are you going to proffer expected testimony?\n\n      MR. WYATT: Yes. The witness that will be called is Pastor Arty\n      Hayes from Texarkana. He is the brother-in-law of Franklin Davis.\n      The testimony that we anticipate coming from Mr. Hayes is about\n      what Franklin Davis did in the meantime after the sexual assaults\n      arose but before the murder case and what he had done to counsel\n      Frank, what he had talked about with Frank, but -- and we believe all\n      that is absolutely admissible.\n\n\n\n                                         136\n\fBut we wanted to bring to the State‘s attention that there are prior\nconsistent statements which will be asked of Mr. Hayes. And we\nwanted to give the State -- tell them exactly what was going to be --\nwhat we anticipate the testimony is going to be.\n\nTHE COURT: How is the talking with the defendant not being\noffered by the defendant and therefore subject to hearsay rule?\n\nMR. WYATT: We‘re not asking about hearsay, Your Honor. We‘re\nasking about what happened. Not specifically about what exactly was\nsaid, but what exactly happened.\n\nWe don‘t believe it‘s hearsay. We don‘t believe it‘s hearsay because\nit‘s his statements about exactly what he was going through firsthand\nfrom the defendant, Your Honor. And under the rules, under\n801(d)1(B), when we look at -- sorry. When we look at prior\nconsistent statements, there‘s a four-prong test that must be adhered\nto.\n\nYour Honor, under Hammons vs. State, Court of Criminal Appeals\n239 S.W. 3d 798, 2000, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals case, Your\nHonor, and in that, we believe that the prongs of the prior consistent\nstatement testimony have been met, Your Honor. Those prongs --\nwould you like me to –\n\nTHE COURT: Are you referring to 801(e)1(B)?\nMR. WYATT: I‘m sorry, yes.\n\nTHE COURT: It‘s not the rule you cited.\n\nMR. WYATT: Yes, I cited the federal rule that they had in this case,\nYour Honor, so I was mistaken in that.\n\nThe four-prong test that they have is the declarant must testify at trial\nand be subject to cross-examination, as Mr. Davis has done.\n\nThere must be an expressed or implied charge of recent fabrication or\nimproper influential motive of the declarant‘s testimony by the\nopponent. That‘s been taken care of by cross-examination of Mr.\nDavis.\n\n                                  137\n\fThe proponent must offer a prior statement that is consistent with the\ndeclarant‘s challenged in-court testimony. That prong has also been\nadhered to or satisfied in this case.\n\nAnd No. 4, the prior consistent statement must be made prior to the\ntime that the supposed motive to falsify arose, which is the murder\ncharge.\n\nAll four prongs of that have been met, Your Honor, and we believe\nthat Franklin‘s prior consistent statements, since they have been put\ninto question by the prosecution, that they can absolutely come in at\nthis point in time that he did not have sex with Shania Gray.\n\nThat‘s been questioned by the State, asked by the Defense in the\nexhibits that have been put in, all the videotapes that have been put in.\nSo -- and the recordings by the State that Franklin Davis made. All\nthose things that have been put into evidence satisfy those four\nprongs. We believe that we can call witnesses to testify to prior\nconsistent statements of Mr. Davis in the guilt/innocent phase of the\ntrial.\n\nTHE COURT: Response from the State?\n\nMR. WILSON: The proffer fails to meet 801(e)1(B) specifically\nfailing to show that the statement was a recent fabrication. These\ndenials have been throughout, so there‘s no recent fabrication aspect\nto it, so therefore they failed to meet the evidentiary predicate. The\ntestimony should be excluded.\n\n[…]\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. You may call the witness. You will not be\nallowed to put on any consistent statements. It is not a recent\nfabrication or improper influence, as Mr. Wilson correctly argued, but\nyou may put the witness on for the other matters that you indicated.\nMake sure you instruct him not to go into any prior consistent\nstatements. You understand that?\n\n\n\n\n                                  138\n\f(RR65: 253–56, 258). Outside the presence of the jury, the defense called Hayes\n\nto make a record of the testimony that was being excluded. (RR65: 259–62).\n\nHayes testified that he met with the Appellant after the Appellant was accused of\n\nsexually assaulting Shania Gray. (RR65: 260). The Appellant had come to him for\n\ncounseling and spiritual guidance, and he denied the allegations. (RR65: 260–62).\n\nThe trial court and defense counsel instructed Hayes that he was not permitted to\n\ntestify that the Appellant denied the allegations. (RR65: 262). However, when\n\nHayes testified before the jury, he ignored those instructions:\n\n      MR. WYATT: When Frank came to see you, he came to see you\n      specifically about some issues he was having, correct?\n\n      HAYES: Yes, sir.\n\n      MR. WYATT: Okay. And those issues being the allegations that he\n      was facing concerning the allegations by Shania Gray of the sexual\n      assault, right?\n\n      HAYES: Yes, sir.\n\n      [...]\n      MR. WYATT: How was his demeanor when you took him into the\n      pastor‘s study?\n\n      HAYES: Well, he was -- he was -- he was very disturbed about the\n      situation and different things like that, and just wanted to speak with\n      us on it and -- and let us know, you know, that I – I’m innocent man.\n      I’m innocent.\n\n      THE COURT: Sir, I told you not to do that.\n\n      HAYES: Excuse me. Your Honor, okay.\n\n\n\n                                         139\n\f      THE COURT: Don't do it again.\n\n      HAYES: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay.\n\n(RR65: 265, 267) (emphasis added).\n\n      Because Hayes testified to the exact statements the trial court excluded, the\n\nAppellant‘s complaint is moot. The jury was able to hear that the Appellant denied\n\nthe sexual assault allegations during his counseling with Hayes, and the trial court\n\ndid not instruct the jury to disregard the testimony. Accordingly, Appellant‘s Issue\n\n19 should be overruled.\n\n               Issues 20 and 21: Ashlye Sams and Lamar Leggiton\n\n      Prior to calling Ashlye Sams as a witness, the defense made a proffer of the\n\ntestimony they intended to elicit from her. (RR65: 280–83). Sams testified that she\n\nhad known Appellant for thirty years—her entire life. (RR65: 281). Sams also\n\ntestified that she learned that the Appellant had been accused of the sexual assault\n\nof a child, and had spoken with him about the charges on the phone sometime in\n\n2012. (RR65: 281). During the conversation, the Appellant denied the allegations\n\nand professed his innocence. (RR65: 281). The State objected to the proffered\n\ntestimony. (RR65: 283). The trial court sustained the objection. (RR65: 283).\n\n      The defense also proffered the testimony of Lamar Leggiton. Leggiton\n\ntestified that he and the Appellant had been best friends for twenty-five years.\n\n(RR65: 284). After Appellant was released from jail following his arrest for the\n\n\n\n                                         140\n\ffours charges of sexual assault, Leggiton was able to talk to the Appellant on the\n\nphone. (RR65: 284). Appellant told Leggiton that he had not sexually assaulted\n\nShania. (RR65: 285). The State objected to the proffered testimony, arguing that a\n\nproper predicate had not been established for admission under Rule 801(e)(1)(B) as\n\na prior consistent statement. (RR65: 286). The trial court sustained the objection.\n\n(RR65: 287).\n\n      The trial court properly sustained the State‘s objections to the proffered\n\ntestimony of Sams and Leggiton. Contrary to the Appellant‘s assertions, the\n\nAppellant failed to establish each of the four factors that predicate the admission of\n\na prior consistent statement under Rule 801(e)(1)(B). As discussed above, this\n\nCourt has recognized four requirements that must be met for prior consistent\n\nstatements to be admissible as nonhearsay. Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at\n\n804. Appellant has failed to satisfy two of the four requirements. First, Appellant\n\nfailed to show that there was an express or implied charge of recent fabrication or\n\nimproper influence or motive. Id. The record reflects that the Appellant had\n\nalways denied that he sexually assaulted Shania.        The State never made any\n\nsuggestion that the Appellant‘s denial had ever deviated or that he had altered his\n\ntestimony regarding the same. Rather, the State merely brought into question the\n\nAppellant‘s credibility, which does not equate to a charge of recent\n\nfabrication. See Tex. R. Evid. 611(b); Bosquez v. State, 446 S.W.3d 581, 586 (Tex.\n\n\n\n                                         141\n\fApp.—Fort Worth 2014, pet. ref‘d); Linney v. State, 401 S.W.3d 764, 781–82\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. ref‘d).\n\n      Additionally, Appellant‘s statements to Sams and Leggiton did not come\n\nprior to the time that his motive to falsify arose. Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at 804.\n\nWhile Appellant argued at trial that his motive to lie arose when he was charged\n\nwith Shania‘s murder, in reality his motive to lie arose when he was indicted on\n\nfour counts of sexual assault of a child. While the Appellant‘s statements were\n\nmade prior to the murder, they occurred after the sexual assault charges. The\n\nsexual assault charges and the subsequent murder were intertwined. The State‘s\n\ntheory in this case was that the Appellant murdered Shania in order to prevent her\n\nfrom appearing as a witness against him in the upcoming sexual assault trial.\n\nAccordingly, his motive to lie arose at the time of the sexual assault charges. See\n\nBosquez, 446 S.W.3d at 586–87; Johnson, 208 S.W.3d at 503–04.\n\n      Because the Appellant failed to establish the predicate for the admission of\n\nhis statements under Rule 801(e)(1)(B), the statements were hearsay offered solely\n\nto bolster the Appellant‘s credibility. Therefore, the exclusion of the complained-\n\nof testimony was a proper exercise of the trial court‘s discretion. Issues 19, 20 and\n\n21 should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                        142\n\f  STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 22: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED THE\nAPPELLANT’S REQUEST FOR A JURY INSTRUCTION ON ANTI-SPECULATION DURING\n               THE GUILT-INNOCENCE STAGE OF HIS TRIAL.\n\n      In Issue 22, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest for an instruction on anti-speculation in the jury charge during the guilt-\n\ninnocence stage of the trial. Appellant‘s contention is without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                                 Pertinent Facts\n\n      On November 8, 2013, during a brief discussion about the jury charge, the\n\nState and defense relayed that neither party had any objection to the charge.\n\n(RR64: 247–48). However, several days later on November 12, the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n      THE COURT: Any objections to the charge?\n\n      MR. PARKS: Let‘s hold off a minute. Let‘s talk about something.\n      THE COURT: There were no objections yesterday.\n      MR. PARKS: I understand. That‘s before I talked to my co-counsel,\n      and he insists that I request a charge on anti-speculation.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. What‘s the State‘s response to that?\n      MS. YEATTS: I‘m not clear the charge being requested, Judge.\n\n      MR. PARKS: The language would be a charge to the jury they must\n      render a verdict based solely on the evidence that they have heard and\n      not upon speculation.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. That request is denied. Anything else? Any\n      other objections?\n\n\n                                       143\n\f      MR. PARKS: No, sir.\n\n(RR66: 19–20).\n\n                      Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      This Court‘s review of purported error in a jury charge involves a two-step\n\nprocess. Kirsch v. State, 357 S.W.3d 645, 649 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012). This Court\n\nmust first determine whether error occurred. Id. If this Court finds no error, then\n\nthe analysis ends. Id. If error occurred, then this Court must analyze the error for\n\nharm. Id.; see also Almanza v. State, 686 S.W.2d 157, 171 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985)\n\n(op. on reh‘g). The degree of harm required for reversal depends on whether the\n\nerror was preserved. Kirsch, 357 S.W.3d at 649; Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491,\n\n504 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Error properly preserved will require reversal as long\n\nas the error is not harmless. Druery, 225 S.W.3d at 504; Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at\n\n171. When jury charge error is not preserved, the error must have been egregious,\n\ni.e., the error was so harmful that it denied the defendant a fair and impartial trial.\n\nDruery, 225 S.W.3d at 504; Almanza, 686 S.W.2d at 171. Upon review, this Court\n\nmust consider the jury charge in its entirety, the state of the evidence, including\n\ncontested issues and the weight of the probative evidence, the arguments of\n\ncounsel and any other relevant information contained within the record. Almanza,\n\n686 S.W.2d at 171; see also Villarreal v. State, 453 S.W.3d 429, 433 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2015).\n\n\n\n                                         144\n\f      Article 36.14 of the Code of Criminal mandates that a trial court submit a\n\ncharge setting forth the law ―applicable to the case.‖ Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann.\n\nart. 36.14 (West 2007). A defendant must be given an opportunity to examine the\n\ncharge and object to any errors of commission or omission. Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\nAnn. art. 36.14 (West 2007). Generally, a defendant must object to the trial court's\n\ncharge or submit special requested instructions in order to preserve error on appeal.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14, 36.15 (West 2007). Objections must\n\ndistinctly specify each ground upon which they are predicated. Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 36.14 (West 2007). Objections and special requested instructions\n\nmust be in writing or dictated to the court reporter. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n36.14, 36.15 (West 2007).\n\n                                    Application\n\n      At trial, Appellant failed to make a proffer of the requested instruction either\n\norally or in writing. (RR66: 19–20). While Appellant stated that he wanted the\n\ncourt to instruct the jury that ―they must render a verdict based solely on the\n\nevidence that they have heard and not upon speculation,‖ this was not sufficient to\n\nmeet the requirement of Article 36.15. (RR66: 19–20). Accordingly, the Appellant\n\nfailed to properly preserve his complaint for review.       Even if this issue was\n\npresented, it is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                         145\n\f      Appellant claims that the trial court should have included an instruction in\n\nthe charge similar to the one found in Thomas v. State: ―You will not consider,\n\ndiscuss, or speculate as to anything that is not shown or supported by the evidence\n\nin this case.‖ Thomas v. State, No. 05-05-01379-CR, 2006 WL 2022404, 2006\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 6303, at *21 (Tex. App.—Dallas July 20, 2006, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication). In Thomas, the State attempted to admit ―documents\n\npurporting to be ‗certified copies of judgment[s] and sentences in prior cases‘‖ for\n\nthe defendant during the punishment phase of his trial. Id. at *20.               The\n\nprosecution‘s sponsoring witness, a clerk of the court, was unable to testify that the\n\ndefendant was the same person as the one named in the prior cases. Id. When the\n\nprosecution informed the court that they would need to call a fingerprint expert, the\n\ndefendant objected on the grounds that the prosecution had not disclosed such a\n\nwitness on their witness list. Id. The trial court sustained the objection and the\n\nevidence was not admitted. Id.\n\n      The defense then requested that the following instruction be included in the\n\ncharge: ―[T]he [S]tate attempted to offer certain documents into evidence that were\n\nnot admitted by the Court. You are instructed that you cannot consider these\n\ndocuments, nor speculate to what they might have contained whatsoever in\n\ndeliberating your punishment verdict.‖ Id. at *20–21. The trial court denied the\n\ninstruction, but instructed the jury as noted above and further included the jury that\n\n\n\n                                         146\n\fit could not consider evidence of any prior crimes or bad acts unless it found\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the prior crimes. Id. at *21.\n\nAccordingly, the instruction in Thomas was proper because it was meant to address\n\na specific issue that arose during the trial.\n\n      Appellant, however, has failed to provide any authority in support of his\n\nclaim that he was entitled to such an instruction in this case or that the trial court\n\nerred by denying the request. While the Appellant is correct that the jury may not\n\nbase its verdict on mere speculation, juries are permitted to draw multiple\n\nreasonable inferences from the evidence. Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 16 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007). The jury was properly instructed in this case. The following\n\ninstructions were included in the charge:\n\n      You are the exclusive judges of the facts proved, of the credibility of\n      the witnesses, and of the weight to be given to the testimony. But you\n      are bound to receive and to follow the law of the Court.\n\n      […]\n\n      The jury is only permitted to receive evidence regarding the case from\n      the witness stand. During your deliberations, you are not to consider,\n      refer to, or discuss any matters or issues not in evidence before you.\n\n      […]\n\n      Mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public\n      opinion, or public feeling is to play no part in your deliberations.\n\n(CR3: 168–69). Thus, the trial court properly instructed the jury not to consider\n\nanything outside of the evidence heard from the witness stand in reaching its\n\n                                           147\n\fverdict or base its verdict on conjecture. The trial court did not err in denying\n\nAppellant‘s request for an anti-speculation instruction.      Issue 22 should be\n\noverruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 23: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN OVERRULING\nAPPELLANT’S OBJECTION TO THE PROSECUTION’S JURY ARGUMENT DURING THE\n                  GUILT-INNOCENCE PHASE OF TRIAL.\n\n      In Issue 23, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State‘s closing argument during the guilt-innocence phase of trial.\n\nAppellant, however, fails to show that the complained-of argument was improper.\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n      The purpose of closing argument is to facilitate the jury‘s proper analysis of\n\nthe evidence presented at trial so that it may arrive at a just and reasonable\n\nconclusion based on the evidence alone and not on any fact not admitted into\n\nevidence. Campbell v. State, 610 S.W.2d 754, 756 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.]\n\n1980). Proper jury argument generally falls within one of four areas: (1)\n\nsummation of the evidence, (2) reasonable deduction from the evidence, (3) answer\n\nto an argument of opposing counsel, and (4) plea for law enforcement. Freeman v.\n\nState, 340 S.W.3d 717, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011).\n\n      The prosecutor may comment on the merits of the argument made by\n\ndefense counsel or the defendant‘s credibility as a witness. See, e.g., Garcia v.\n\nState, 126 S.W.3d 921, 925 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); Satterwhite v. State, 858\n\n\n\n                                        148\n\fS.W.2d 412, 425 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993). However, argument that strikes at a\n\ndefendant over the shoulders of defense counsel is improper. See Davis v. State,\n\n329 S.W.3d 798, 821 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 767; Wilson v.\n\nState, 7 S.W.3d 136, 147 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). A prosecutor‘s argument runs a\n\nrisk of improperly striking at a defendant over the shoulder of counsel when it is\n\nmade in terms of defense counsel personally and when it explicitly impugns\n\ndefense counsel‘s character. Brown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 572 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2008).\n\n      Even when an argument exceeds the permissible bounds of the approved\n\nareas, such will not constitute reversible error unless, in light of the record as a\n\nwhole, the argument is extreme or manifestly improper, violative of a mandatory\n\nstatute, or injects new facts harmful to the accused into the trial proceeding.\n\nWesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 115 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). The remarks must\n\nhave been a willful and calculated effort on the part of the State to deprive\n\nappellant of a fair and impartial trial. Id. An instruction to disregard, which the jury\n\nis presumed to follow, will generally cure the improper argument. Id.\n\n                                     Application\n\n      Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the\n\nState‘s striking at him over defense counsel‘s shoulders and shifting the burden of\n\nproof during its closing argument in the guilt-innocence phase of his trial.\n\n\n\n                                          149\n\f      During closing argument in the guilt-innocence phase, defense counsel made\n\nthe following argument:\n\n      MR. HAYES: They have to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt\n      that this murder was committed to prevent something from happening\n      in the future. And nothing has proven that [sic] you. There‘s been\n      nothing. Four days of testimony about it being premeditated, that\n      doesn‘t get them there. Four days of testimony that he was angry, that\n      doesn‘t get them there. Four days of testimony that she filed charges,\n      that doesn‘t get them there. Those retaliations, that doesn‘t get them\n      there.\n\n      In order to jump from first degree murder to capital murder, that very\n      specifically has to be proven. That‘s what we talked to each of you\n      about in voir dire, and that just didn‘t get them there.\n\n      All you see was a guy who lost everything, who behaved in a horrible,\n      horrible way and committed a horrible, horrible act.\n\n      Think about it. Did you hear a single thing where he said, ―I did it to\n      keep her from testifying‖?\n\n      We played everything. There‘s 14 hours of Frank talking. Did he ever\n      say that? There are even times when the detectives tried to get him to\n      mention it. Detective Williams, top-notch detective, she couldn't get\n      him to admit it. She tried to. She tried to pin him down. He said the\n      exact same thing he told everybody else, ―I told her how much she\n      fucked up my life.‖\n\n      Told her what she did in the past affected his life. He was at his\n      breaking point because she ruined his life. ―Fucked up everything. I\n      couldn‘t take care of my kids, my household. Had to get rid of my car.\n      I went from having diamond earrings and a nice job to being wiped\n      out completely.‖\n\n      Nothing about what was going to happen in the future. They tried to\n      get him to pin it down.\n\n\n\n\n                                       150\n\f      Keep in mind, never searched anything about that particular offense,\n      and he never talked to a lawyer. He didn‘t know what he was doing.\n      They tried to walk him around the best they could, and he didn't give\n      it to them. Do you know why? He lied a lot, but the thing he's being\n      consistent about is why. Why he did it.\n\n      And unless they prove something other than that, he‘s guilty of\n      murder. And he can still get up to a life sentence in murder. No one‘s\n      trying to say he‘s not guilty, no one, because he is. But the system\n      doesn‘t work unless you punish someone for what they did. The\n      system never works if you punish someone for what the State wants\n      you to do unless it‘s proven.\n\n(RR66: 45–46). Defense counsel further argued:\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: So when you go back there, if you can even get past\n      the fact that they didn‘t indict this case properly in the manner and\n      means, the drowning, which is -- look at the autopsy, that‘s that it\n      says. If you can get past that and you get to whether it‘s capital\n      murder or just murder, you‘ve got to come back with a verdict that is\n      just murder, because it‘s not obstruction. Because that‘s not -- he did\n      not kill her to prevent her from testifying, and that‘s what they have to\n      prove. They didn‘t do that. They didn‘t do that beyond a reasonable\n      doubt really.\n\n      Keep in mind, you come back with a verdict of murder, if you find it\n      appropriate, you can still sentence Frank to life in prison. But at least\n      do it for what the real charge is, what‘s really been proven to you.\n\n(RR66: 58). In rebuttal, the State made the following complained-of argument:\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: [H]e‘s the only person that said he didn‘t do it\n      because she was a witness or reported a crime. He‘s the only one that\n      says that.\n\n      It only comes from Frank. It only comes from Frank.\n\n      So what type of guy is Frank? He wants you to believe that he could\n      beat these charges. Frank, the one whose credibility you‘re supposed\n      to believe, the one who you‘re supposed to believe is a truth teller,\n\n                                        151\n\fFranklin tells you, ―I solved this case for Carrollton.‖ He walks in and\ntalks to Detective Chevallier and he says, ―Y‘all got it wrong. I‘m\ngoing to tell you what happened because I think I can beat this case.‖\nHe‘s telling you he can beat this capital murder case.\n\nWe spend two days talking about what we had, and the secret, the\nsecret is in his phone. I agree with Franklin Davis 100 percent when\nhe talks to Chevallier, ―technology is a mother-fucker.‖\n\nWhat do we get from the phone? What do we know before Franklin\never says he did anything? We know that his cell phone tower -- that\nhis cell phone, here in State‘s Exhibit Number 37, was bouncing off\nthe same tower as Shania Gray and Hebron High School. It was\nbouncing off the same tower as Sherry Gray and Hebron High School\nat the time that she went missing. It was bouncing off the towers the\nnight before when he wasn‘t supposed to be anywhere in Mesquite.\nWe know that not because Franklin told us, but because we solved\nthat case.\n\nDetective Williams solved that case. Andrew Hoog told us about\nthose fake text messages, the ones that he says so tearfully, ―You‘ve\ngot to believe me, I made these -- I didn‘t make these, Shania sent\nthem to me, and they're going to get me off.‖\n\nWe solved that, not him. We knew that Franklin had these audio\nrecordings because we had his phone. We knew that Franklin had this\nthrow-away phone saved in his contacts. We knew that not because he\ntold us, but because we investigated that case.\n\nWe knew that Shania died by asphyxiation and by gunshot wounds\nnot because he told us, but because we did the autopsy in this case.\nWe didn't need Franklin to tell you he did it. We knew he did it before\nhe walked into that interrogation room.\n\nHe wants you to give him credit and find him guilty of the lesser\nincluded offense of murder. They keep bringing up the punishment\nrange. They want you to think about the punishment range. Make\nyou feel better about doing something that’s not supported by what\nFranklin says.\n\n\n                                  152\n\f      MR. HAYES: Judge, now I have to object. I think that‘s improperly\n      striking at the defendant over counsel‘s shoulder and it shifts the\n      burden.\n\n      THE COURT: Fair reply. Overruled. Ten minutes.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: That‘s why they do that. They want you to\n      look everywhere but what happened on the shores of the Trinity\n      River.\n\n(RR66: 66–69) (emphasis added).\n\n      Appellant argues that the comment referring to defense counsel‘s attempt to\n\ndirect the jury away from the guilt-innocence stage of the trial suggested that\n\ndefense counsel were misleading the jury, bringing their credibility and veracity\n\nwith the jury into question. Appellant summarily argues that the comments were\n\nmanifestly improper, harmful, and prejudicial.\n\n      The trial court properly overruled the Appellant‘s objection because the\n\nargument was made in response to the argument made by defense counsel. The\n\nprosecutor‘s comments were not a personal attack on defense counsel; rather, they\n\nwere made in answer to counsel‘s argument that the jury should accept the\n\nAppellant‘s assertions that he killed Shania because she had ruined his life and not\n\nto prevent her from testifying against him, and therefore, he was guilty only of\n\nmurder. On two occasions during the defense team‘s closing argument counsel\n\nmentioned that the jury could find the Appellant guilty of murder, the lesser\n\noffense, and still sentence the Appellant to life in prison.\n\n\n\n                                          153\n\f      It is clear from the context of the argument that the prosecutor‘s statement\n\nwas not directed at defense counsel personally, but was an attack on the argument\n\nmade by defense counsel. Such an argument was permissible and appropriate. See\n\nGarcia, 126 S.W.3d at 925 (concluding that a prosecutor‘s argument that defense\n\ncounsel was ―going to put himself before twelve citizens of this community and\n\nhe‘s going to argue that hogwash that you‘ve heard‖ was merely a colorful way of\n\nattacking the merits of defense counsel‘s argument); Banks v. State, 643 S.W.2d\n\n129, 134 (Tex. Crim. App. 1982) (holding ―all these rabbit trails, all these smoke\n\nscreens that he wants you to hide behind and chase down‖ proper as comment on\n\ndefendant‘s failure to produce testimony other than his own words); Hinojosa v.\n\nState, 433 S.W.3d 742, 764–65 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2014, pet. ref‘d)\n\n(deciding that prosecutor‘s use of terms such as ―tactics,‖ ―smoke and mirrors,‖\n\nand ―hide the ball‖ were appropriate in response to the argument made by defense\n\ncounsel); Acosta v. State, 411 S.W.3d 76, 93–94 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2013, no pet.) (concluding that prosecutor‘s argument that the jury should ―not to\n\nbe fooled‖ by evidence presented by the defense, which was ―good lawyering,‖\n\nwas proper in response to the argument made by defense counsel). Consequently,\n\nthe trial court did not err by overruling the Appellant‘s objection to this argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                         154\n\f                            Error, if any, was Harmless\n\n      Further, even if this Court were to find that the State‘s argument was\n\nimproper, any error was harmless. Improper argument is non-constitutional error,\n\nand non-constitutional error that does not affect a defendant‘s substantial rights\n\nmust be disregarded. Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). To\n\ndetermine whether an appellant‘s substantial rights were affected, an appellate\n\ncourt balances three factors: (1) the severity of the misconduct (i.e., the prejudicial\n\neffect), (2) any curative measures, and (3) the certainty of conviction absent the\n\nmisconduct. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572–73. In evaluating the severity of the\n\nmisconduct, the reviewing court must assess whether the argument injected new\n\nand harmful facts or was, in light of the entire argument, extreme or manifestly\n\nunjust and willfully calculated to deprive appellant of a fair and impartial trial. Id.\n\nat 573.\n\n      Viewing the State‘s closing argument as a whole, the record does not\n\ndemonstrate that there was a willful, calculated effort to deprive the Appellant of a\n\nfair and impartial trial. The prosecutor‘s argument was made in response to the\n\nargument made by defense counsel that the jury could still sentence the Appellant\n\nto life in prison if they found him guilty of murder rather than capital murder. It is\n\nclear from the context of the argument that the prosecutor did not have an improper\n\n\n\n\n                                         155\n\fmotive and the complained-of statements were only a small portion of the whole\n\nargument.\n\n      Finally, the evidence of Appellant‘s guilt was overwhelming. The Appellant\n\ntestified that he murdered Shania. The only disputed issue was whether Appellant\n\nhad done so in order to prevent her from testifying against him in the upcoming\n\nsexual assault trial. While Appellant vehemently denied this and instead argued\n\nthat he killed her because she had ruined his life, there was considerable evidence\n\nthat proved the Appellant killed Shania to prevent her from testifying.\n\n      The State presented evidence of the Appellant‘s elaborate plan to manipulate\n\nShania using a false identity. The evidence showed that Appellant pretended to be\n\na young man named ―D‖ who was interested in getting to know Shania. The\n\nAppellant called Shania using this false identity and recorded their conversations.\n\nIn the conversations, the Appellant manipulated Shania into talking about the\n\nsexual assault allegations and about her sexual history, hoping to get Shania to\n\nmake statements that he could use to attack her credibility at the trial.\n\n      He also attempted to dissuade her from testifying by suggesting that she\n\ncould go to jail if she was caught lying and by telling her that the man she was\n\ntestifying against might hold a grudge against her and come after her when he got\n\nout of jail. When this tactic ultimately failed, the Appellant created a series of fake\n\ntext messages, which he intended to use as evidence at the trial. The six messages,\n\n\n\n                                          156\n\fall appearing to be from Shania, contained her alleged recantation of the sexual\n\nassault allegations.\n\n      The Appellant then used the false identity to lure Shania into a meeting,\n\nduring which he drove her to a secluded portion of the Trinity River, forced her to\n\nwalk down an embankment to the river, and shot her in the back. When she fell\n\ninto the water, the Appellant shot her again in the neck. He then pulled her out of\n\nthe water, laid her on the ground, and placed his foot on her throat until she\n\nstopped breathing. After rolling her body into the river, he left the scene to dispose\n\nof the gun and other evidence. When questioned by the police about Shania‘s\n\ndisappearance, the Appellant denied any involvement, and continued to maintain\n\nthat he was innocent of the sexual assault charges. The Appellant relied on the\n\nfake text messages as evidence that he was innocent of the sexual assaults and also\n\nas evidence that he would have had no reason to harm Shania now that she had\n\nrecanted.\n\n      Based on this evidence, the jury most certainly would have convicted\n\nAppellant regardless of the prosecutor‘s statements. Thus, any error in the\n\nprosecutor‘s argument did not affect appellant‘s substantial rights. See Brown, 270\n\nS.W.3d at 572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). Accordingly, Issue 23 is without merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         157\n\f   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 24: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n              SUPPORT THE JURY’S ANSWER TO SPECIAL ISSUE 1.\n\n      In Issue 24, the Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury‘s answer to Special Issue No. 1, the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. Specifically, the Appellant asserts that he had no prior violent offense\n\nconvictions and defense witnesses testified that he was essentially a low risk for\n\nfuture dangerousness. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 113–16). Appellant‘s contentions\n\nare without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The State has the burden of proving the punishment issue of future\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071,\n\n§§ 2(b)(1), 2(c) (West Supp. 2014). In assessing the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence of future dangerousness, this Court views the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. See Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 284.\n\n      In its determination of the special issues, the jury is entitled to consider all\n\nthe evidence presented at the guilt phase of the trial, in addition to the evidence\n\npresented at the punishment phase. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863. Some factors the\n\njury may consider when determining whether appellant will pose a continuing\n\n                                         158\n\fthreat to society include: (1) the circumstances of the offense, including the\n\ndefendant‘s state of mind and whether he was working alone or with other parties;\n\n(2) the calculated nature of his acts; (3) the forethought and deliberateness\n\nexhibited by the crime‘s execution; (4) the existence of a prior criminal record and\n\nthe severity of the prior crimes; (5) the defendant‘s age and personal circumstances\n\nat the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was acting under duress or the\n\ndomination of another at the time of the offense; (7) psychiatric evidence; and (8)\n\ncharacter evidence. See Wardrip v. State, 56 S.W.3d 588, 594 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2001); Keeton v. State, 724 S.W.2d 58, 61 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). The\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the events surrounding it may be sufficient in\n\nsome instances to sustain a ―yes‖ answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.\n\nYoung, 283 S.W.3d at 863.\n\n                                    Application\n\n      The evidence from both phases of the trial unquestionably demonstrates\n\nAppellant‘s future dangerousness. First, the facts of the offense, standing alone,\n\nare sufficient to support the jury‘s finding. The evidence showed that in April\n\n2011 Shania made an outcry of sexual assault, telling her mother that the Appellant\n\nhad assaulted her while she was babysitting his daughter and two other children.\n\nAs a result of that admission, the Appellant was indicted on four counts of sexual\n\n\n\n\n                                        159\n\fassault of a child in August 2011. One year later, the Appellant was notified that\n\nthe trial on the charges was set for October 29, 2012.\n\n      With only a few months until the trial, the Appellant began an elaborate plan\n\nto manipulate Shania into dropping the charges against him. First, the Appellant\n\ncreated a false identity. The Appellant found a Facebook profile for a young man\n\nthat he believed Shania would find attractive, Artis Powell.        The Appellant\n\ncontacted Shania and told her that he had seen her Facebook profile and wanted to\n\nget to know her. The Appellant told Shania that he was Powell, but went by the\n\nnickname ―D‖ because his middle name was Dwayne. The Appellant then used a\n\n―throwaway phone‖ he purchased at Walmart to call Shania while pretending to be\n\n―D.‖ The Appellant recorded the conversations with Shania on his T-Mobile smart\n\nphone.\n\n      In the conversations, the Appellant attempted to elicit statements he could\n\nuse against her at the sexual assault trial. He manipulated her into talking to him\n\nabout the sexual assaults, trying to get her to make statements that were\n\ninconsistent with what she told the police. The Appellant also asked Shania about\n\nher past sexual relationships, looking for information he could use to disparage her\n\ncharacter. He attempted to dissuade her from testifying by suggesting that she\n\ncould go to prison if she was caught lying. He also told her that the man she was\n\ntestifying against might hold a grudge against her if he went to prison and might\n\n\n\n                                         160\n\fcome after her when he was released. The Appellant also suggested that she go to\n\nthe police and tell them that she lied, so the charges would be dropped. He assured\n\nher that the police would not do anything to her because she was a minor. Despite\n\nthe Appellant‘s repeated manipulations, Shania did not recant the allegations or\n\nrequest to drop the charges.\n\n      When this tactic failed, the Appellant murdered Shania. Realizing that\n\nShania had a ―crush‖ on ―D,‖ the Appellant lured her into meeting him after\n\nschool. The Appellant drove Shania to a secluded area at Sam Houston Trail Park\n\nand forced her to walk down an embankment to the Trinity River. The Appellant\n\nthen shot her in the back. When she fell into the water, the Appellant shot her a\n\nsecond time in the neck. When the Appellant realized she was not dead, he pulled\n\nher out of the water, laid her on the ground, and placed his foot on her throat until\n\nshe stopped breathing. The Appellant then rolled her body into the river and left\n\nthe scene to dispose of the gun and other evidence.\n\n      The Appellant also created a series of fake text messages that he intended to\n\nuse as evidence at the sexual assault trial.       The messages, made using an\n\napplication he installed on his smart phone, appeared to be from Shania and\n\ncontained a recantation of the sexual assault allegations. When first questioned by\n\nthe police, the Appellant denied any involvement in Shania‘s disappearance and\n\nalso claimed that he had text messages that proved he was innocent of the sexual\n\n\n\n                                        161\n\fassault charges. Even after he ultimately confessed to the murder, the Appellant\n\ncontinued to tell the detectives and the media about the text messages, never\n\nadmitting to anyone that they were fake.\n\n      The calculated and deliberate nature of the Appellant‘s actions in\n\ncommitting this violent and heinous murder was sufficient to support the jury‘s\n\nfinding of future dangerousness. See Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491, 507 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007) (the circumstances of an offense can be some of the most\n\nrevealing evidence of future dangerousness and may be sufficient to independently\n\nsupport an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness issue).\n\n      The State, however, did not rely solely on the facts of the offense to prove\n\nthe Appellant‘s future dangerousness. During the punishment phase of his trial,\n\nthe jury also heard about the Appellant‘s escape from Parkland Hospital while in\n\npolice custody awaiting trial for capital murder.\n\n      Dallas County Sheriff‘s Deputy Steven Underwood was assigned to guard\n\nthe Appellant on the evening of December 4, 2012. (RR66: 147). The Appellant\n\nhad been admitted to Parkland Hospital on December 1, 2012 after complaining\n\nthat he was dizzy. (RR68: 68). This was the Appellant‘s sixth trip to Parkland\n\nsince his arrest. (RR68: 67–68). Underwood testified that the Appellant was due to\n\nbe discharged at 9:30pm. (RR66: 147). At approximately 8:00pm, shortly after\n\nUnderwood returned from a break, the Appellant asked Underwood if he could\n\n\n\n                                         162\n\ftake a shower before going back to jail. (RR65: 147). Underwood agreed and\n\ndecided to remove the Appellant‘s leg restraints and handcuffs. (RR66: 148).\n\n        Once the leg restraints were removed, the Appellant sat up on the side of the\n\nbed and faced Underwood. (RR66: 148). When the handcuffs were also removed,\n\nthe Appellant said: ―I‘m sorry, man,‖ and grabbed Underwood by his gun holster\n\nand vest and backed him into the wall. (RR66: 148–50). Underwood testified that\n\nthe Appellant had some type of sharp object in his left hand and told him that he\n\nwould cut him if he moved. (RR66: 150–51). Underwood testified that he grabbed\n\nthe Appellant and backed him into the left corner of the room. (RR66: 151). The\n\ntwo wrestled around and the Appellant reached for Underwood‘s gun. (RR66:\n\n151).\n\n        Underwood tried to knock the Appellant to the ground but was unable to;\n\ninstead, the Appellant landed on a nightstand. (RR66: 151–52). The two continued\n\nto wrestle, and then Underwood heard a ―pop.‖ (RR66: 152). Underwood‘s holster\n\nhad broken and the Appellant had his gun. (RR66: 152). Underwood testified that\n\nhe focused on holding onto the gun and keeping it pointed away from him during\n\nthe struggle. (RR66: 152–53). However, the Appellant was able to free himself\n\nfrom Underwood and pointed the gun at him. (RR66: 153–54). The gun was a\n\nfully loaded 40-caliber Glock 22. (RR66: 167, 170). Underwood put his hands in\n\nthe air and complied with the Appellant‘s commands to get on the ground. (RR66:\n\n\n\n                                         163\n\f155–56). The Appellant then fled the room. (RR66: 157). Later that night, Dallas\n\nSWAT was able to locate the Appellant a few blocks away from Parkland Hospital\n\nin a red Austin‘s Barbeque van parked between two buildings. (RR67: 54, 57–61;\n\nSX: 292–95). Approximately twenty to twenty-five SWAT officers responded to\n\nthe location. (RR67: 55). After an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the\n\nSWAT team, the Appellant surrendered. (RR67: 61).\n\n      The State also presented evidence of the Appellant‘s history of emotionally\n\nand physically abusing the women in his life. The Appellant testified on cross-\n\nexamination that he had five children. (RR65: 182).           However, he also\n\nacknowledged that could have as many as eleven children. (RR65: 182–83). Four\n\nof the mothers of his children testified at his trial concerning the abuse they\n\nsuffered during their relationships.\n\n      Linda Crawford, the mother of the Appellant‘s twelve year-old son Trey,\n\ntestified about multiple incidents in which the Appellant was physically violent\n\nwith her. (RR66: 80). Linda met the Appellant in 2000 when she was sixteen and\n\nthe Appellant was eighteen. (RR66: 80–81). Linda became pregnant with Trey a\n\nfew months after the two began dating. (RR66: 83). The first incident in which the\n\nAppellant became violent with her occurred when she was seven or eight months\n\npregnant with Trey. (RR66: 85). Linda surprised the Appellant at his apartment\n\nand found him with another woman. (RR66: 85, 101). Linda tried to push her way\n\n\n\n                                       164\n\finto the apartment, but the Appellant came outside, pushed her and told her to ―get\n\ngoing and don‘t come around here.‖ (RR66: 86, 103–04). He grabbed her by the\n\nthroat and held her against the building, again telling her to leave. (RR66: 86). He\n\npushed her and shoved her away from the apartment, all the way to a nearby\n\nconvenience store. (RR66: 86).\n\n      Linda testified that sometime in 2001, after Trey was born, the Appellant\n\ncalled her to come over to his apartment so that they could be ―intimate.‖ (RR66:\n\n87). While she was at his apartment, Labrena, the mother of Appellant‘s other son,\n\nreturned home and wanted to know why Linda was there. (RR66: 87–88, 106).\n\nThe Appellant pretended not to know, and feeling embarrassed, Linda began to\n\nargue with him. (RR66: 88). At one point, Linda threw a baby‘s milk bottle at the\n\nAppellant, hitting him in the face. (RR66: 116). The Appellant picked up the\n\nbottle and poured the milk over her head. (RR66: 116, 118–19).\n\n      As Linda was leaving, the Appellant swung a clothes hanger at her and hit\n\nher on her arm. (RR66: 88). Linda was holding Trey, who was a few months old at\n\nthe time, and had to ―let him go‖ in order to defend herself. (RR66: 88). She was\n\nable to catch Trey before he hit the ground, but she ended up with a cut on her arm\n\nfrom the clothes hanger. (RR66: 88). Following this incident, Linda‘s father called\n\nthe police and Appellant was arrested for assault. (RR66: 88).\n\n\n\n\n                                        165\n\f      Linda testified that she knew the Appellant had multiple other children.\n\n(RR66: 89). He had a thirteen year-old daughter named Kurstyne with Latrice\n\nBrown, a twelve year-old son named Ahmad with Labrena Henderson, and another\n\nson named TK with a woman named Nicole. (RR66: 89–90).          Linda did not learn\n\nthat TK was the Appellant‘s son until he was arrested in this case, despite the fact\n\nthat TK and his mother lived in her apartment complex and her son played with\n\nTK. (RR66: 90).\n\n      Labrena Henderson, the mother of the Appellant‘s son Ahmad, testified that\n\nshe met the Appellant in 1999 while working at a McDonalds in Texarkana.\n\n(RR66: 122–23). The two began a romantic relationship and Linda gave birth to\n\nAhmad Davis on September 24, 2001. (RR66: 124). Labrena testified that the\n\nAppellant, who was living with her at that time, would leave at night and not come\n\nback for days at a time. (RR66: 127). When he returned, she would ask him where\n\nhe had been and he would get upset. (RR66: 128). On one occasion, he pushed her\n\nagainst the wall. (RR66: 127–28). Labrena immediately left and went to her\n\nmother‘s house. (RR66: 128).\n\n      Jennifer Dibrell, the mother of the Appellant‘s daughter Dezire, testified\n\nabout several incidents of violence involving the Appellant. (RR67: 73–74). When\n\nJennifer was pregnant with Dezire, she and the Appellant got into an altercation\n\nwhen she found out that the Appellant was with another woman rather than at his\n\n\n\n                                        166\n\fsister‘s house. (RR67: 75). During that altercation, the Appellant grabbed her, and\n\npinned her by her arms so that she could not move, and whispered in her ear: ―I\n\nhope you lose your baby.‖ (RR67: 75).\n\n      On another occasion, after Dezire was born, the Appellant pulled a knife on\n\nher during an argument. (RR67: 77). Dezire was present and saw the entire\n\nincident. (RR67: 78). Jennifer grabbed Dezire and held her so that the Appellant\n\nwould not hurt either of them. (RR67: 77–78). On another occasion, the Appellant\n\nshot her in the leg with a BB gun during an argument. (RR67: 78). Finally,\n\nJennifer testified that the Appellant forced her to have anal sex after one of their\n\narguments. (RR67: 79–80). Jennifer testified that she felt that the Appellant was\n\nmanipulative. (RR67: 80–81). When she caught him in a lie, he would act like she\n\nwas crazy and tried to make other people think she was crazy too. (RR67: 80–81).\n\n      The Appellant was also violent with his wife Jawanna Arrington. Jawanna\n\nand the Appellant became engaged in August 2010 and married in June 2011.\n\n(RR66: 201–02). Jawanna testified that the Appellant ―put his hands on her‖ on\n\nseveral occasions. (RR66: 202). He choked her, threatened her with knives, and on\n\ntwo occasions, put a gun to her head. (RR66: 202, 209–10). Jawanna testified that\n\nthe violent incidents would begin with an argument, and when she responded to his\n\nanger with silence, he would grab her around the neck with both hands and choke\n\n\n\n\n                                        167\n\fher. (RR66: 202–03). Jawanna testified that this happened more than twenty times\n\nover the course of their relationship. (RR66: 204).\n\n      Jawanna testified that they would argue about everything from the Appellant\n\nhaving a bad day to her catching him texting other women. (RR66: 205). On one\n\noccasion when they were arguing over her cell phone, the Appellant forced\n\nJawanna to the floor against the fireplace. (RR66: 204). She ended up with bruises\n\nand scratches on her back from the bricks on the fireplace. (RR66: 204). Jawanna\n\ndid not call the police because she loved the Appellant and did not want him to get\n\nin trouble, nor did she want her family to find out about the abuse. (RR66: 203).\n\n      Finally, the State offered certified copies of the Appellant‘s four prior\n\nconvictions for: (1) burglary of a motor vehicle in 2001; (2) evading arrest in 2001;\n\n(3) failure to identify in 2001; and (4) fleeing or attempting to elude a police\n\nofficer in 2007. (RR66: 138–142; SX: 244–48).\n\n      Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence based on the lack of\n\nprior convictions for violent offenses and because defense witnesses testified that\n\nhe was a low risk for future dangerousness. The Appellant‘s argument, however,\n\nfails to consider the substantial evidence of violence in his relationships. The\n\nevidence showed that the Appellant would lie and manipulate to get what he\n\nwanted. Over the course of five years he had five children with five different\n\nwomen. In fact, Linda, the mother of his son Trey, did not find out that TK was\n\n\n\n                                        168\n\fthe Appellant‘s son until this trial, even though he lived in the same apartment\n\ncomplex with her and played with her son. The Appellant was able to convince\n\nmultiple women to continue their sexual relationships with him after he had left\n\nthem for another woman. The evidence showed that the Appellant responded with\n\nviolence when any of the women he was in a relationship with attempted to\n\nquestion or challenge him about his infidelity. The Appellant was manipulative\n\nand violent with men as well. He was able to get Deputy Underwood to remove\n\nhis restraints under the pretense of taking a shower, then used that opportunity to\n\noverpower Underwood, steal his gun, and escape.\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, there is sufficient evidence\n\nfor a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that\n\nthe Appellant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support\n\nthe jury‘s answer to the future dangerousness special issue, and Issue 24 should be\n\noverruled.\n\n   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 25-35: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED\n     APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND OVERRULED HIS\n                      OBJECTIONS TO THE CHARGE.\n\n      In Issues 25 through 35, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his requested instructions and overruling his objections to the court‘s\n\n\n\n\n                                         169\n\fpunishment charge. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 117–41).               The Appellant‘s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n      On November 12, 2013, the Appellant filed a motion entitled ―Defendant‘s\n\nObjections to the Charge at Punishment.‖ (CR3: 174–89). In that motion, the\n\nAppellant raised 55 objections to the trial court‘s punishment charge. (CR3: 174–\n\n89). The Appellant‘s objections were overruled. (RR68: 130).\n\n      In Issue 25, the Appellant recites verbatim the paragraphs titled ―Objections\n\nto Language in the Body of the Instructions‖ from his ―Defendant‘s Objections to\n\nthe Charge at Punishment.‖ (CR3: 174–80). In Issues 26 through 35, the Appellant\n\nrecites verbatim the paragraphs titled ―Defendant‘s Objections to the Verdict\n\nForms‖ from his ―Defendant‘s Objections to the Charge at Punishment.‖ (CR3:\n\n174–88).\n\n      In his briefing on appeal, the Appellant asserts no additional analysis and\n\nprovides no law other than that presented to the trial court. He concedes that\n\nsimilar claims have been previously rejected by this Court. Appellant indicates\n\nthese issues are included in his direct appeal brief in order to preserve them for\n\nsubsequent review by the federal courts. Although he asks this Court to reconsider\n\nits prior rulings, he does nothing to persuade the Court that its prior decisions were\n\nincorrect.\n\n\n\n\n                                         170\n\f       To the extent that the State is able to discern the Appellant‘s objections or\n\nrequested instruction, the State agrees that with Appellant his claims are foreclosed\n\nby well-settled law. (See Appellant‘s Brief at p. 117). Where possible, the State\n\nhas attempted to address the Appellant‘s claims or has attempted to provide the\n\nCourt with a citation to the applicable statute or to authority wherein the same or\n\nsimilar issue, instruction, or objection has been addressed and rejected.\n\n                    Issue 25: Objections to the Punishment Charge\n\n                                           Issue 25\n\n        25(1): The trial court‘s punishment charge does not contain the\n         complained-of language: ―In order for the Court to assess proper\n         punishment ….‖ (CR3: 190–97).\n\n        25(2): The trial court‘s punishment charge does not contain language\n         ―instructing each juror as if it [sic] he/she were one decision making\n         body.‖ (CR3: 190–97).\n\n        25(3): Appellant objects to particular language used in the charge\n         pertaining to answering the special issues, including the use of\n         ―determine,‖ ―shall answer,‖ or ―arriving at the answers to.‖ (CR3: 175).\n         The court‘s charge only utilized the phrase ―shall answer‖ in one\n         instance—in Appellant‘s favor.13 Generally regarding the jury‘s answers\n         to the special issues, the trial court used a combination of ―duty to\n         determine,‖ ―in deliberating on,‖ ―shall next consider,‖ ―in arriving at,‖\n         and ―in determining your answers.‖ (CR3: 190–95). Appellant presents\n         no support, either at trial or on appeal, for the contention that use of this\n         language was erroneous or violated his constitutional rights.\n\n\n13\n  Regarding special issue number one, the charge instructed the jurors that if they did not find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to the first special issue (regarding future\ndangerousness) should be yes or if they had a reasonable doubt as to the answer, then they ―shall\nanswer‖ the special issue ―no.‖ (CR3: 191).\n\n\n                                              171\n\f 25(4): The punishment charge did not utilize the term ―mandatory\n  punishment.‖\n\n 25(5): Mays v.

App. 2008).\n\n 25(6): Appellant seems to complain that the trial court failed to explain\n  to the jury that its directive to consider ―all of the evidence‖ controls over\n  the definition of mitigating evidence (evidence that a juror might regard\n  as reducing the Defendant‘s moral blameworthiness).                 Such an\n  instruction, for the jury to prioritize one instruction and disregard\n  another, would be wholly improper, and the State asks this Court to reject\n  this complaint.\n\n 25(7): Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 306–07; Gardner v.

Appellant presents no support, either at trial or on appeal, for the\n  contention that failure to give such a written instruction was erroneous or\n  violated his constitutional rights.\n\n 25(15): Saldano v.

Appellant provides no support for this\n  allegation, and the State asks this Court to reject his contention as\n  unfounded.\n\n 25(18): Appellant sought an instruction that each juror‘s opinion was to\n  be respected and any juror who felt bullied, harassed, or intimidated\n  should pass a note indicating so to the bailiff. Failure to provide such an\n  instruction was not erroneous and did not violate Appellant‘s\n  constitutional rights, and the State asks this Court to reject this complaint.\n\n            Issues 26-35: Objections to the Verdict Form\n\n                                Issue 26\n\n The Appellant does not present an Issue 26.\n\n\n\n\n                                   173\n\f                             Issue 27\n\n Renteria, 206 S.W.3d at 709; Russeau v.

Accordingly, the\n\nState asks this Court to overrule Issues 25 through 35 as meritless.\n\n\n\n\n                                         175\n\f      STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 36-37: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED\n       APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTION DEFINING EVIDENCE THAT\n                    REDUCES “MORAL BLAMEWORTHINESS.”\n\n          In Issues 36 and 37, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying\n\nhis requested instruction defining evidence that reduces ―moral blameworthiness.‖\n\nOn April 30, 2013, the Appellant filed a pretrial motion entitled ―Defense‘s\n\nRequested Charge Defining Evidence That Reduces Moral Blameworthiness.14‖\n\n(CR2: 120, 126, 132). The State filed a response the same day. (CR2: 138–43).\n\nThe trial court denied the motion on May 2, 2013. (CR2: 125, 137).\n\n          In his motion, Appellant challenges Article 37.071, sections 2(e)(1) and\n\n2(f)(4), arguing that the sections are unconstitutional because they narrow the\n\njury‘s consideration of mitigating factors. (CR2: 120–37); Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\n\nAnn. art. 37.071, §§ 2(e)(1), 2(f)(4) (West Supp. 2014). As explained in the\n\nState‘s response, and as Appellant acknowledges in his brief, this Court has\n\nalready considered these arguments and has rejected them. See Roberts v. State,\n\n220 S.W.3d 521, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); see also Coble v. State, 330 S.W.3d\n\n253, 296 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010); Mays, 318 S.W.3d at 396. While Appellant\n\nrequests that this Court review these issues again and reverse its position, he\n\npresents no new arguments for the State to address. Accordingly, the State asks\n\n\n\n\n14\n     It appears to undersigned counsel that the Appellant filed three copies of this motion.\n\n\n                                                  176\n\fthis Court to decline his invitation to revisit these claims and overrule Issues 36\n\nand 37.\n\n   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 38-48: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED\n        APPELLANT’S CHALLENGES TO THE DEATH PENALTY STATUTE.\n\n        In Issues 38 through 48, Appellant challenges the constitutionality of the\n\nTexas death penalty statute.       He acknowledges that these issues have been\n\npreviously submitted to this Court and overruled, citing Saldano v. State, 232\n\nS.W.3d 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Nonetheless, he raises these grounds to invite\n\nthis Court to review its prior stance on these issues and to preserve the issues for\n\nfurther review in the federal courts. (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 143).\n\n        In Issue 38, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion Requesting the Court to Find Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Art. 37.071 Section 2(f)(4) to be Unconstitutional.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p.\n\n143).\n\n        In Issue 39, Appellant contends that trial court erred in denying his pretrial\n\nmotion entitled ―Motion to Declare the ‗10-12 Rule‘ Unconstitutional.‖\n\n(Appellant‘s Brief at p. 144).\n\n        In Issue 40, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion for Court to Find Art. 37.071 of the Texas Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure Unconstitutional as Applied to this Defendant.‖ (Appellant‘s\n\nBrief at p. 144).\n\n                                          177\n\f      In Issue 41, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Declare the Capital Sentencing Statute\n\nUnconstitutional Because it Allows Juries to Decide Future Dangerousness Based\n\nSolely of the Factors of the Case.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 144).\n\n      In Issue 42, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Preclude Death as a Sentencing Option and to\n\nDeclare Texas Death Penalty Statute Unconstitutional Because of Juror‘s Inability\n\nto Predict Future Dangerousness.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 144).\n\n      In Issue 43, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Declare the Capital Sentencing Statute\n\nUnconstitutional Because it Has Become a De Facto Mandatory Death Penalty\n\nStatute.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 144).\n\n      In Issue 44, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Find that the Death Penalty in the State of\n\nTexas is Unconstitutional on the Ground that its Capital Sentencing Procedure\n\nFails to Meet Minimum Requirements Set Forth in Furman v. Georgia and its\n\nProgeny, as Evinced by the Findings of the Capital Jury Project and other\n\nResearch.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 145).\n\n      In Issue 45, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Declare Article 37.071, § 2(a) of the Code of\n\n\n\n                                           178\n\fCriminal Procedure Unconstitutional on its Face under Due Course of Law and\n\nDue Process.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 145).\n\n      In Issue 46, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Declare Article 37.071, § 2(a) of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure Unconstitutional on its Face for Lack of Standards.‖\n\n(Appellant‘s Brief at p. 145).\n\n      In Issue 47, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Hold Statutory Definition of Mitigating\n\nEvidence Unconstitutional, as Applied to Impose a ‗Nexus‘ Limitation, and to\n\nGrant Defendant‘s Requested Clarifying Voir Dire, Instruction, Argument and\n\nMotion in Limine.‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 145).\n\n      In Issue 48, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\npretrial motion entitled ―Motion to Preclude the Death Penalty as Sentencing\n\nOption (Denial of Equal Protection).‖ (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 146).\n\n      Appellant invites this Court to revisit its prior decisions on these issues,\n\nwhich he agrees have all been previously overruled. (See Appellant‘s Brief. at p.\n\n143–46); Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 107–09 (overruling multiple challenges to death\n\npenalty statute); Escamilla, 143 S.W.3d at 828–29 (same). Appellant presents no\n\nnew arguments for the State to address. Accordingly, the State asks this Court to\n\n\n\n\n                                        179\n\fdecline his invitation to revisit these legal claims and to overrule Issues 38 through\n\n48.\n\n                                     PRAYER\n\n       The State prays that this Honorable Court will affirm the judgment of the\n\ntrial court.\n\n                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                               /s/ Rebecca D.

See Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(h) (West Supp. 2014). The trial court sentenced the\n\nAppellant to death on November 16, 2013 for the capital murder of Shania Gray.\n\nThe Appellant filed his brief on February 27, 2015.         He presents forty-eight\n\nallegations of reversible error.\n\n                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n                                     Guilt/Innocence\n\n                                   State’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      In September 2010, fourteen year-old Shania Gray was a freshman in high\n\nschool and had just started her first job babysitting Jennifer Dibrell‘s three young\n\nchildren. (RR60: 75–77). The Appellant was the father of Jennifer‘s youngest\n\nchild, Dezire. (RR60: 75–77, 79).          After several months of babysitting, the\n\nAppellant suggested they give Shania a Blackberry cell phone as payment. (RR60:\n\n80; SX: 235).\n\n      One night in early April 2011, Shania‘s mother Sherry noticed a text\n\nmessage on Shania‘s phone from ―Wish.‖ (RR60: 81). Sherry, who had met the\n\n\n\n                                            1\n\fAppellant once on Christmas, knew that he went by that nickname. (RR60: 75, 78–\n\n79, 81). Sherry took the phone and saw a message asking Shania why she was no\n\nlonger coming over to babysit. (RR60: 81, 87). The next message Sherry saw said:\n\n―I want you. I just can‘t have you right now.‖ (RR60: 87). When Sherry asked\n\nShania about the messages, she became visibly upset and began to cry. (RR60: 88).\n\n      Sherry took Shania to Jennifer‘s house to discuss the messages, but Jennifer\n\ndid not seem surprised by the messages; in fact, she was nonchalant about the\n\nentire situation. (RR60: 88–89). Sherry asked Jennifer to call the Appellant on the\n\nphone. (RR60: 89). The Appellant would not speak with Sherry, but told Jennifer\n\nto have her call him the following day after work. (RR60: 89).\n\n      Shania was still upset and crying on the drive home. (RR60: 91). Sherry\n\ndecided to take Shania to her grandmother‘s house, two blocks away, to spend the\n\nnight. (RR60: 91). Sherry wanted an opportunity to talk to her husband Marvin\n\nabout what course of action they should take. (RR60: 91–92).\n\n      The following morning, Sherry sent the Appellant a text message informing\n\nhim that they were going to call the police regarding the inappropriate text\n\nmessages between him and Shania. (RR60: 92). The Appellant responded and\n\nclaimed Shania was lying. (RR60: 92). Later that day, Shirley Brown, the mother\n\nof one of Shania‘s friends, brought Shania home and asked to talk to Sherry.\n\n(RR60: 98–101). Shania had told Shirley that the Appellant had sexually assaulted\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fher. (RR60: 98–99, 101). That evening, Sherry‘s husband called the Appellant.\n\n(RR60: 93). The Appellant claimed that he did not know the text messages were\n\nfrom Shania and had responded to them as a joke. (RR60: 93–94).\n\n      At that point, Sherry contacted Officer Johnny Ivy, the Student Resource\n\nOfficer (―SRO‖), at Shania‘s high school. (RR60: 95). Sherry told Officer Ivy that\n\nthe father of the children that Shania had been babysitting was sending her\n\ninappropriate text messages. (RR60: 96).      Officer Ivy contacted the Mesquite\n\nPolice Department on Sherry‘s behalf, and an officer arrived at their home a few\n\nhours later. (RR60: 97). The officer spoke to Shania and took a general statement.\n\n(RR60: 105–06). Shania then met with Detective Snyder at the Mesquite Police\n\nDepartment. (RR60: 105–07). Snyder scheduled an appointment for Shania at the\n\nDallas Children‘s Advocacy Center (―DCAC‖). (RR60: 105–07). Sherry took\n\nShania for a forensic interview and then to Children‘s Medical Center for a\n\nREACH examination. (RR60: 107; SX: 239).            Sherry was later contacted by\n\nDetective Snyder and informed that the Appellant had been indicted on four counts\n\nof sexual assault of a child. (RR60: 108; SX: 9, 10, 11, 12).\n\n      In September 2012, Shania transferred to Hebron High School in Carrollton.\n\n(RR60: 112–13). Shania did not have a driver‘s license, so Sherry drove her to and\n\nfrom school because they were still living in Mesquite. (RR60: 113–14). Sherry\n\nand Shania would communicate by text message during the day. (RR60: 114–15).\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\fOn her second day of school, September 6, 2012, Shania sent Sherry a text\n\nmessage telling her that she was going to stay after school for physics tutoring.\n\n(RR60: 116–17, 121).\n\n      Sherry arrived to pick Shania up at approximately 4:05pm. (RR60: 116,\n\n121). When Sherry called Shania to let her know she was at the school, Shania\n\ntold her that the tutoring session was wrapping up and she would be out in a few\n\nminutes. (RR60: 117). Sherry reminded Shania that they had choir practice that\n\nevening. (RR60: 117). By 4:20pm, Sherry began to text Shania, but received no\n\nresponse. (RR60: 118). After thirty minutes passed, Sherry barraged Shania with\n\ncalls, but her phone went straight to voice mail. (RR60: 118–19).\n\n      Sherry decided to go inside the school to look for Shania, but the door to the\n\nphysics classroom was locked and the lights were off. (RR60: 121). Sherry then\n\nchecked the gymnasium and spoke with a coach who was able to contact Shania‘s\n\nphysics teacher, Christine Cone. (RR60: 122, 150–53). Cone confirmed that Shania\n\ncame to her class for tutoring that afternoon, but left at approximately 4:00pm after\n\nshe received a phone call from her Sherry. (RR60: 150–54). Shania told Cone that\n\nshe ―had to hurry and go; my mom‘s waiting on me.‖ (RR60: 155). This was the\n\nlast time Shania was seen alive. (RR61: 228). The search for Shania continued\n\nuntil nearly midnight to no avail. (RR60: 123–30).\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\f      The next morning, September 7, 2012, Sherry went back to the school and\n\nspoke with SRO Forest Langston. (RR60: 131, 172–75).        Langston contacted\n\nMesquite Horn High School, Shania‘s previous school, and learned that Shania\n\nwas the named victim in four sexual assault cases currently pending against the\n\nAppellant. (RR60: 131, 136–37, 179–81). Langston pulled the phone records for\n\nShania‘s phone and discovered that she had been in contact with someone with a\n\n903-603-8786 number around the time she disappeared. (RR60: 175–76).\n\nLangston called the number; however, no one answered and the voice mail was not\n\nset up. (RR60: 176).   Langston learned that the phone was a prepaid phone\n\npurchased at Walmart and had no subscriber information. (RR60: 177).\n\n      Langston also checked the school‘s surveillance video and found footage of\n\nShania exiting the south side of the building. (RR60: 185–89; SX: 16). She\n\nappeared to have a cell phone in her hand. (RR60: 189; SX: 16). The video also\n\nshowed a gray Dodge Stratus parked on the south side of the building. (RR60:\n\n186–89; SX: 16).\n\n      At this point, Detective Dena Williams with the Carrollton Police\n\nDepartment became involved in the case. (RR60: 132–33). Williams obtained the\n\ncall records for the 903-603-8786 number based on exigent circumstances. (RR61:\n\n58). The 903 number had only been in contact with four other numbers, so\n\nWilliams called each of the numbers and left a message. (RR61: 220–21).\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\fShakeema Morsley returned the detective‘s call and informed her that she believed\n\nthat the Appellant was the person contacting her from the 903 number. (RR61:\n\n222). Morsley did not have the Appellant‘s phone number, but she did have a\n\nnumber for his wife, Jawanna Arrington. (RR61: 223).\n\n      Williams called Jawanna and was able to speak to with her and the\n\nAppellant. (RR61: 223). Williams told them that she was investigating a missing\n\nchild case and asked them about the 903 number. (RR61: 224). Both denied\n\nknowing anything about the 903 number. (RR61: 224–25). Jawanna owned a 2005\n\ngray Dodge Stratus that was registered to an address in Irving. (RR60: 218–20).\n\n      Carrollton Police Detectives Perritt and Cook drove to the address that\n\nJawanna‘s 2005 gray Dodge Stratus was registered to in Irving while Williams was\n\non the phone with the Appellant. (RR61: 218–21, 225–26). The detectives made\n\ncontact with the Appellant when he stepped outside of his apartment to take out\n\nsome trash. (RR61: 218–21, 225–26). The detectives were able to confirm that\n\nneither Shania nor any evidence of a crime scene were present at the Appellant‘s\n\napartment. (RR61: 226). The Appellant agreed to come to the police department to\n\ntalk to Detective Williams. (RR61: 224, 226–27). The Appellant drove himself\n\nand his wife in their own vehicle. (RR61: 224, 226–27).\n\n      By the time the Appellant arrived at the Carrollton Police Department it was\n\n1:48am on Saturday September 8, 2012. (RR61: 227).           In the first of four\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\finterviews with the police, the Appellant denied any involvement in Shania‘s\n\ndisappearance. (RR63: 25–26; SX: 57, 57C). The Appellant insisted that he was\n\ninnocent of the sexual assault charges and told Williams that Shania had sent him\n\nsome text messages admitting that she lied about the assaults because her mother\n\nmade her. (SX: 57, 57C).         The Appellant offered to show Williams the text\n\nmessages on his T-Mobile smart phone1. (RR62: 26–27). At the time of this\n\ninterview, Detective Williams did not have any data from the cell phone towers\n\nand did not know that the text messages that the Appellant wanted to show her\n\nwere fake. (RR62: 25–26, 30–32).            At the conclusion of the interview, the\n\nAppellant was placed under arrest for outstanding traffic warrants from Balch\n\nSprings and was also placed on a forty-eight hour investigative hold. (RR62: 39–\n\n41; SX: 57, 57C).\n\n       Detective Jeremy Chevallier conducted the second interview with the\n\nAppellant, which the Appellant initiated. (RR62: 39–41, 51; SX: 57, 57B). He told\n\nChevallier he wanted to talk to him because he forgot to tell Detective Williams\n\nthat he had recorded conversations between himself and Shania. (SX: 57, 57B).\n\nThe Appellant claimed that he recorded the conversations because he felt like his\n\ncourt-appointed attorney was not going to do a good job. (SX: 57, 57B). The\n\nAppellant told Chevallier that the recordings contained statements from Shania that\n\n1\n The record reflects the number for the Appellant‘s T-Mobile phone is 972-302-1976. (SX: 50,\n51, 52).\n\n\n                                             7\n\fcontradicted what she told the police. (SX: 57, 57B). The Appellant continued to\n\ndeny any involvement in Shania‘s disappearance. (SX: 57, 57B).\n\n       Approximately an hour and a half after his second interview, Chevallier was\n\nnotified that the Appellant wanted to speak with him again. (RR62: 71). During\n\nthis third interview, the Appellant admitted that the phone with the 903 number\n\nwas his and he admitted to killing Shania. (SX: 57, 19A). The Appellant confessed\n\nto taking Shania to a park off of Interstate 635, shooting her twice, and then putting\n\nhis foot on her neck until she stopped breathing. (SX: 57, 19A). He then rolled her\n\nbody into the Trinity River and left the park. (SX: 57; 19A). During the interview,\n\nShania‘s body was found floating face-down in the Trinity River in a secluded\n\nsection of Sam Houston Trail Park near the intersection of Interstate 635 and the\n\nGeorge Bush Tollway. (RR61: 108–17; RR62: 73; SX: 57, 19A). At the end of the\n\ninterview, the Appellant agreed to take Chevallier to the crime scene. (RR62: 75,\n\n79).\n\n       Shania‘s body was in the process of being recovered when they arrived.\n\n(RR62: 78). Crime scene investigators found a backpack containing Shania‘s\n\nidentification card and other papers identifying her near her body. (RR63: 130; SX:\n\n113, 114, 115). The Appellant took police to two ponds where he had disposed of\n\nevidence. From these ponds, police recovered a Diamondback .380 handgun,\n\nwhich the Appellant identified as the gun he used to shoot Shania, Shania‘s iPhone,\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fand the Appellant‘s muddy shoes. (RR62: 79, 90–92; RR63: 131, 133, 180–81;\n\nSX: 58, 221).\n\n      On September 9, 2012, Detective Williams and Detective Grigg were\n\nnotified that the Appellant wanted to talk to them again. (RR62: 117). They went\n\nto the jail and met with him for his fourth interview. (RR62: 117–18; RR63: 20;\n\nSX: 72, 72A). During the interview, the Appellant talked about the sexual assault\n\ncharges and again told Williams about the text messages Shania sent him. (RR63:\n\n26). The Appellant claimed that when Shania got in the car just prior to her\n\nmurder, she told him: ―I‘m going to tell the truth.       You‘re right, this never\n\nhappened. It was my mama that made me do it.‖ (RR63: 26).\n\n      The autopsy revealed that Shania had been shot twice. (RR63: 261–63).\n\nOne of the gunshot wounds entered the back of her right shoulder, traveled through\n\nthe muscles of her shoulder and neck, and exited through the right side of her neck.\n\n(RR63: 264). The second gunshot wound entered the lower left side of Shania‘s\n\nback and ended up in the iliopsoas muscle of her right hip. (RR63: 264). The\n\nbullet was recovered from her body. (RR63: 264). Neither bullet struck any major\n\nblood vessels or organs. (RR63: 264). Shania had another injury, to her throat, that\n\nwas consistent with asphyxia. (RR63: 265).        Though decomposition made it\n\ndifficult to see the injury to Shania‘s neck, it was clear that the thyroid cartilage\n\nthat makes up the voice box was fractured, an injury consistent with pressure from\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fa foot or knee being applied to the area. (RR63: 265–66). The medical examiner\n\ntestified that the cause of death was homicidal violence including gunshot wound\n\nand asphyxia, with the asphyxia including both the neck compressions and possible\n\ndrowning. (RR63: 278–79).\n\n         The Diamondback .380 handgun, two cartridge cases, and two bullets were\n\nsent to the Tarrant County Medical Examiner‘s Crime Lab for examination.\n\n(RR62: 95–96). The two cartridge cases and one of the bullets were recovered\n\nfrom the crime scene, and the second bullet was recovered during Shania‘s\n\nautopsy. The crime lab determined that the cartridges and the bullets were fired by\n\nthe handgun recovered from the pond. (RR62: 104)\n\n         Data from T-Mobile and AT&T was also used to track the movement of the\n\nAppellant and Shania during her disappearance. The data showed that on the\n\nevening of September 5, 2012, at approximately 10:11pm, the Appellant‘s phone2\n\nhit off of a cell tower near Shania‘s house. (RR61: 197–98; SX: 56). At that time,\n\nShania‘s phone was not hitting off of the tower near her home, indicating that she\n\nwas not there. (RR61: 195–96).            Over the next several hours, multiple text\n\nmessages and calls were exchanged between the numbers. (RR61: 195–99; SX:\n\n56). By the end of the conversations, at approximately midnight, the Appellant‘s\n\n\n\n\n2\n    This examination used the 903-603-8786 throwaway phone. (RR61: 188–91).\n\n\n                                              10\n\fcell phone was hitting off of a tower near his apartment, and Shania‘s cell phone\n\nwas hitting off of a cell phone tower near her home. (RR61: 197–98; SX: 56).\n\n      At approximately 12:36pm on September 6, 2012, the Appellant‘s cell\n\nphone hit off of a cell tower near Shakeema Morsley‘s apartment. (RR61: 201).\n\nFrom 3:30pm until approximately 4:30pm, the Appellant and Shania‘s cell phones\n\nwere both hitting off of a cell tower near Hebron High School. (RR61: 201–04).\n\nAt approximately 5:15pm, Shania‘s phone hit off of a cell tower near the\n\nAppellant‘s apartment, and shortly thereafter, was no longer in contact with the\n\nnetwork. (RR61: 204–05).     Additionally, cell phone records showed that the\n\nAppellant received two calls to his 972-302-1976 smart phone at approximately\n\n4:01pm on September 6, 2012. (RR61: 178; SX: 50, 51, 52). The calls hit off of a\n\ncell tower located near Hebron High School. (RR61: 178–79; SX: 50, 51, 52).\n\n      Considerable evidence was also recovered from the Appellant‘s T-Mobile\n\nsmart phone (972-302-1976). Jeff Shaffer, a Special Agent with the Dallas Field\n\nOffice of the Secret Service, conducted a forensic examination of the phone.\n\n(RR60: 229, 231; SX: 18). Shaffer‘s forensic examination revealed:\n\n    A deleted contact named ―throwaway‖ with a cell phone number 903-603-\n     8786. (RR60: 247–48; SX: 20).\n\n    A picture of Shania downloaded onto the phone on July 13, 2012. (RR60:\n     249–50; SX: 20).\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f       Multiple Google searches:\n\n             o On August 28, 2012 at 5:26pm, the Appellant searched for gun shows\n               in Dallas. (RR60: 252–53; SX: 20).\n\n             o On August 29, 2012, the Appellant conducted searches for a\n               Diamondback .380 handgun and its price. (RR60: 254–55; SX: 20).\n\n             o On September 6, 2012 at 1:53pm, the Appellant searched for Hebron\n               High School. (RR60: 257; SX: 20).\n\n       On August 30, 2012, the Appellant placed multiple calls to a person named\n        Chris.3 (RR60: 254).\n\n       A map search for the intersection of I-635 and Highway 161, the location of\n        Sam Houston Trail Park, where Shania‘s body was found. (RR60: 264; SX:\n        21).\n\n       Six text messages were also recovered from the Appellant‘s phone. (RR60:\n        266). The messages all appeared to be from the number 214-709-6861,\n        Shania‘s cell phone number. (RR60: 266; SX: 20).\n\n             o The first message, sent on August 27, 2012 at 8:25pm4, stated: ―Ar3 u\n               still mad @ m3?‖ (RR60: 266–68; SX: 20).\n\n             o The second message, sent at 8:35pm, stated: ―Sorry I li3d on u but my\n               momma mad3 m3 do it. If we go to court ima t3ll th3m u never\n               touched me. My my momma go b3 mad @ m3 but fuck that bitch I\n               can‘t stand her no ways. Please 4give me.‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n             o The third message, sent at 9:40pm, said: ―Is this mr. Wish#.‖ (RR60:\n               267–68; SX: 20).\n\n             o The fourth message, sent on August 28, 2012 at 7:50pm, said only:\n               ―Mr. Wish?‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n3\n The trial testimony showed that the Appellant bought a gun from a man named Christopher\nAllen on August 30, 2012. (RR63: 131).\n4\n    All times were in Coordinated Universal Time, or ―UTC‖. (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n\n                                               12\n\f            o The fifth message, sent at 7:53pm, said: ―I beli3v3 if I t3ll the truth\n              sh3 will punish m3 for a long tim3 and I want b3 able to play\n              basketball.‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n            o The final message, sent at 8:04pm, said: ―Pl3as3 r3spond back if this\n              is still your numb3r.‖ (RR60: 267–68; SX: 20).\n\n      The timeline recovered from the phone showed that on August 27, 2012 at\n\n7:55pm UTC, an application called ―Fake Call & SMS & Call Log‖ was installed\n\non the phone. (RR60: 268; SX: 42, 43). All of the messages and calls from number\n\n214-709-6861 came after the installation of the fake SMS and call log application.\n\n(RR60: 270–71). The cell phone records for the two numbers did not show any\n\ncalls or text messages that corresponded with those occurring after the installation\n\nof the fake SMS and call log application. (RR60: 277–78).\n\n      Because the six text messages appearing to come from Shania were\n\nsuspicious, additional forensic examination was conducted on the Appellant‘s\n\nphone by Andrew Hoog, an expert in smart phone data recovery. (RR61: 130–32).\n\nHoog was able to determine that the six text messages that appeared to be sent\n\nfrom Shania‘s cell phone were fake and had been created by the fake SMS and call\n\nlog application. (RR61: 150). Hoog‘s examination of the Appellant‘s phone also\n\nrevealed:\n\n    A calendar entry for a July 24, 2012 court date. (RR61: 151).\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f    Google searches for:\n\n         o ―Can you record a person without them knowing in Texas?‖ and ―Can\n           you record a person by phone without them knowing in Texas?‖ on\n           July 18, 2012. (RR61: 152–53).\n\n         o ―Best way to get off of a sexual assault charge.‖ and ―With no proof\n           that you did the murder, can you still be held in jail?‖ at 12:55pm the\n           same day. (RR61: 154).\n\n         o ―Can you voice-record a minor over the phone in Texas?‖ and ―Can\n           tape-record conversation with a person story changing and get you off\n           a charge?‖ on July 19, 2012. (RR61: 154–55).\n\n         o ―Can tape-recorded conversation be used in court?‖ and ―Can tape-\n           recorded conversation against a minor?‖ on July 23, 2012. (RR61:\n           155).\n\n    Logins to Facebook accounts for Jazmine Brown and Domee Elkins Brown.\n     (RR61: 157–61). While logged in as Jazmine, the Appellant sent a friend\n     request to Shania. (RR61: 160–61; SX: 48).\n\n    An Intellius search for Shania Gray in Texas. (RR61: 162).\n\n       An hour-long recorded conversation was also recovered from the phone.\n\n(RR60: 236).    In the recording, the Appellant, using the false identity ―D,‖\n\nquestioned Shania at length about the sexual assaults. (RR61: 92; SX: 19, 19B).\n\nHe also told Shania to tell the prosecutors that she lied about the sexual assault\n\ncharges and that she would not get in trouble because she was a minor. (SX; 19,\n\n19B). The Appellant also told her: ―[I]f he turn around and go to the pen and get\n\nout, he might have a grudge towards you, and you know, say, come after you . . .\n\nwhen he get out of jail.‖ (SX: 19, 19B).\n\n\n                                           14\n\f                              Defense Case-in-Chief\n\n       Detective Brandon Snyder, with the Mesquite Police Department, was the\n\nlead detective investigating the sexual assault charges against the Appellant.\n\n(RR64: 27–28).      Snyder testified that Shania‘s mother discovered the text\n\nmessages between the Appellant and Shania on April 7, 2011. (RR64: 31). The\n\nfamily did not contact the police department and make a report until April 14,\n\n2011. (RR64: 31). Snyder was assigned to the case on April 15, 2011. (RR64: 29).\n\nSnyder was informed that the Appellant had contacted the police department on\n\nApril 11, 2015, in order to determine if a report had been made about him. (RR64:\n\n30).\n\n       Once Snyder was assigned to the case, he scheduled a forensic interview for\n\nShania at the DCAC on April 21, 2011. (RR64: 31–32). Snyder was present when\n\nCaitlin Clevenger conducted the interview. (RR64: 88). In the interview, when\n\nClevenger asked Shania if ―anything like this had ever happened before,‖ Shania\n\ntold Clevenger ―no.‖ (RR64: 107–08; SX: 239). After the forensic interview,\n\nSnyder interviewed Sherry, who gave him consent to process Shania‘s cell phone\n\nso that he could access the text messages. (RR64: 32).\n\n       The cell phone was processed on April 25, 2011. (RR64: 33). One of the\n\ncontacts in Shania‘s Blackberry was for ―Wish,‖ with the number 972-302-1976.\n\n(RR64: 74–75). Shania also had his birthday listed on her calendar. (RR64: 75).\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f      The April 7, 2011 string of text messages between the Appellant and Shania\n\nwas recovered. (RR64: 76; SX: 235). The first message from the Appellant said:\n\n―Wow ok then goodbye,‖ and was sent at 21:50:30. (RR64: 76; SX; 235). Shania\n\nresponded: ―Imm not saynn goodbye just yet…‖ at 21:50:56. (RR64: 76; SX: 235).\n\nThe Appellant responded: ―Thats foul so im pose to sit around an wait! Man\n\nwhateva,‖ at 21:51:47. (RR64: 76; SX: 235). Shania replied: ―Nope now yhu gettn\n\nmad for wahh!!!!!! Yhu got 2 for the price if one wahh yhu complainin\n\nfor…….tryna have yhur cake nd eat it too,‖ at 21:53:19. (RR64: 76; SX: 235). The\n\nAppellant responded: ―Just want u but cant fully have u yet,‖ at 21:54:17. (RR64:\n\n77; SX: 235). Snyder testified that the text exchange between Shania and the\n\nAppellant looked like a conversation between individuals in an intimate\n\nrelationship with one another. (RR64: 113–14).\n\n      The Appellant denied the allegations when Snyder interviewed him. (RR64:\n\n44; DX: 2). He told Snyder that he thought Shania had a crush on him. (RR64: 50;\n\nDX: 2). The Appellant also said that Shania would invite boys over while she was\n\nbabysitting. (RR64: 51; DX: 2). The Appellant told Snyder that he deleted the text\n\nmessages. (RR64: 63; DX: 2). He told Snyder that he was ―just playing around,‖\n\nand was just explaining to Shania that she was too young and he could not see her.\n\n(RR64: 77; DX: 2). Snyder did not take the Appellant‘s phone. (RR64: 63; DX:\n\n2).\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f      Following his interview with the Appellant, Snyder interviewed the outcry\n\nwitnesses. (RR64: 53). Snyder testified that one of the outcry witnesses told him\n\nthat Shania had changed her story. (RR64: 40). He did not interview the children\n\nthat Shania was babysitting. (RR64: 53). Snyder testified that Shania told him the\n\nchildren were sent to clean their room or were outside when he assaulted her.\n\n(RR64: 54). Snyder did not interview Jennifer, the children‘s mother, because she\n\nwas not present when the assaults occurred. (RR64: 55). Snyder did not visit the\n\nlocation of the assaults. (RR64: 57).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he killed Shania because she ruined his life.\n\n(RR64: 136). According to the Appellant, he lost everything because she lied\n\nabout the sexual assaults. (RR64: 136). The Appellant characterized the time prior\n\nto the allegations as ―happy,‖ but claimed that ―Shania‘s lies‖ changed everything.\n\n(RR64: 145). The Appellant had just married Jawanna and he had just been\n\npromoted at Dr. Pepper, despite having only been there for three or four months.\n\n(RR64: 142–44).\n\n      The Appellant was unable to return to Dr. Pepper after his arrest for the\n\nsexual assault charges because he could no longer pass a background check and he\n\nwas forced to file for unemployment. (RR64: 145–49). The Appellant testified that\n\nhis wife looked at him differently because he was unable to provide for his family;\n\nthey were no longer able to go to the movies, go out to eat or go shopping. (RR64:\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f148, 151). When they argued, Jawanna would tell the Appellant that everything\n\nwas on her shoulders because she was the sole provider. (RR64: 152).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he met Shania for the first time on Christmas\n\n2010. (RR64: 174–75). He would see her when he went to visit Jennifer‘s kids,\n\nwhich was usually about four times a week. (RR64: 187). The Appellant testified\n\nthat Shania had a nice personality and made him laugh. (RR64: 182–83). The two\n\nformed a bond and he started to care for her like a sister. (RR64: 183). In fact,\n\nShania would confide in him. (RR64: 190). The Appellant estimated that he spent\n\nsix or seven hours a week with her. (RR64: 190–91). However, he denied ever\n\nbeing alone with her. (RR64: 193). The Appellant denied having sex or any sexual\n\ncontact with her and also denied swatting or grabbing her butt. (RR64: 183).\n\n      The Appellant testified that when he first received text messages from\n\nShania, he did not know that they were from her. (RR64: 207). He claimed that\n\nShania asked him whether or not he loved Jawanna, and he told her that he did,\n\nwhich was why he was going to marry her. (RR64: 209–10). The Appellant\n\nclaimed that Shania then told him that she wished she had not gotten her feelings\n\ninvolved because she wanted him. (RR64: 210). It was then that he sent her the\n\ntext messages telling her he could not have her ―like that‖ because she was too\n\nyoung. (RR64: 212). The Appellant claimed that the text message he sent her\n\nstating: ―Wow ok then gudbye,‖ and ―That‘s foul so im pose to sit around an wait!\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fMan whateva‖ were referring to how long it was taking Shania to respond to his\n\nprevious message5. (RR64: 213; SX: 235).\n\n         The Appellant testified that he knew Shania had a crush on him because she\n\nhad flirted with him on previous occasions. (RR64: 212). He denied flirting with\n\nher but characterized himself as a ―charmer.‖ (RR64: 213). The Appellant did not\n\nwant to hurt her feelings so he was trying to ―let her down easily.‖ (RR64: 214).\n\nAppellant explained that the text: ―Nope now yhu gettn mad for wahh!!!!!! Yhu\n\ngot 2 for the price if one wahh yhu complainin for…….tryna have yhur cake nd eat\n\nit too,‖ was referring to him having sex with Jennifer after he was engaged to\n\nJawanna. (RR64: 215–16; SX: 235). The Appellant claimed that Jennifer told\n\nShania about the encounter. (RR64: 217).\n\n         The Appellant hired Tom Cox to represent him on the sexual assault charges\n\nand agreed to pay him $15,000, $6,000 coming from the Appellant‘s car, which he\n\nsigned over to Cox. (RR64: 158–59). The Appellant agreed to a payment plan to\n\npay the remaining $9,000. (RR64: 158–59). He tried to pay the remainder of the\n\nfee using his unemployment benefits, but he only received $275 to $300 every two\n\nweeks. (RR64: 158–59). In the end, he was only able to pay Cox $4,600 in cash\n\nbecause his unemployment benefits ran out. (RR64: 161–62). According to the\n\nAppellant, Cox never hired an investigator to look into the charges and never set\n\n5\n    Cell phone records show that less than one minute passed between the texts. (SX: 235).\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fhis cases for trial. (RR64: 162, 165). However, Cox did tell him that Shania had\n\ntrichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease. (RR64: 166).\n\n      When the Appellant told Cox he could no longer pay him, Cox asked the\n\ncourt to withdraw from the case. (RR64: 163–64).           The court granted the\n\nwithdrawal and appointed Hugo Aguilar to represent him in August 2012. (RR64:\n\n171). The Appellant testified that he never met with Aguilar aside from when he\n\nwas first appointed and Aguilar never returned his phone calls. (RR64: 172). The\n\nAppellant became concerned that Aguilar was not going to help him, so he began\n\nhis own investigation. (RR65: 21).\n\n      First, he began to look for anything online that could be used to attack\n\nShania‘s character. (RR65: 22). The Appellant went to Shania‘s Facebook page,\n\nbut it was private. (RR65: 22). The Appellant created a fake Facebook profile\n\nunder the name Jazmine Brown and tried to communicate with Shania. (RR65: 23).\n\nShania, however, did not accept his friend request. (RR65: 24).\n\n      Next, the Appellant contacted his nephew Domee Elkins for access to his\n\nFacebook page. (RR65: 24). The Appellant chose Elkins because he was young\n\nand handsome. (RR65: 24). The Appellant sent Shania a friend request under\n\nElkins‘ profile and she accepted. (RR65: 24). He was then able to access her\n\nprofile and found her phone number. (RR65: 25). He decided to contact her by\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\ftext message. (RR65: 25). The Appellant bought a ―throwaway‖ phone from\n\nWalmart to contact Shania. (RR65: 26).\n\n      That night, the Appellant contacted Shania claiming to be ―D,‖ a relative of\n\nElkins. (RR65: 27, 34). The Appellant had looked on Facebook for a profile he\n\ncould claim was ―D‘s‖ and decided to use Artis Powell‘s. (RR65: 27, 35). The\n\nAppellant told Shania his middle name was Dwayne, so he went by ―D.‖ (RR65:\n\n34). He told Shania if she wanted to see what he looked like, she should visit\n\nPowell‘s Facebook page. (RR65: 27). The Appellant had already sent Powell a\n\nmessage from the Jazmine Brown Facebook page warning Powell not to respond to\n\nany messages from Shania because she was underage. (RR65: 26–27).\n\n      Two or three days after the Appellant first sent Shania a text message, she\n\ncalled him. (RR65: 30). At first, the Appellant thought Shania had figured out\n\nwhat was going on, but then she sent him a text message telling him she wanted to\n\ntalk. (RR65: 30). The Appellant went down to his car and called her back on the\n\nthrowaway phone. (RR65: 30). He placed the call on speakerphone and recorded it\n\nusing his smart phone. (RR65: 30). The Appellant testified that he recorded seven\n\nof their conversations. (RR65: 30). The Appellant admitted that there was not\n\nmuch on two or three of the recordings. (RR65: 30–31).\n\n      The Appellant felt good about his investigation because in one of the\n\nrecordings, Shania said there were only three sexual assaults instead of four, and\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fshe also stated that one of the assaults occurred in the bedroom of his apartment.\n\n(RR65: 32; SX: 19, 19B). The Appellant testified that this contradicted what she\n\nsaid in the DCAC video because she said it happened in the bathroom at his\n\napartment. (RR65: 31–32; SX: 19, 19B, 239). The Appellant said that the other\n\nrecording also proved her bad character because she talked about having sex.\n\n(RR65: 32). The Appellant made all of the recordings within a week of having\n\nfirst contacted her. (RR65: 33).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he took the recordings to his attorney, who was\n\n―kind of iffy‖ about them. (RR65: 35). He then drove to Mesquite and was going\n\nto play the recordings for Sherry and Marvin, but began to worry that they would\n\nclaim he forced his way into their house. (RR65: 35–37). The Appellant was on\n\nthe phone with his son Trey‘s mother Linda at the time, and she told him about an\n\napplication that could be downloaded and used to make fake text messages. (RR65:\n\n37). The Appellant decided that the fake text messages would give him the ―extra\n\npush‖ to prove his point and get the prosecutor to dismiss the case. (RR65: 39).\n\nThe Appellant admitted that he created the fake text messages. (RR65: 40–41). He\n\nalso admitted that he bought a gun from Linda‘s brother, Christopher Allen.\n\n(RR65: 43).\n\n      The Appellant testified he went to the James‘ house on September 5, 2012,\n\nwith the gun. (RR65: 38, 48). He contemplated killing the entire family, but when\n\n\n\n                                       22\n\fhe thought about Shania‘s younger brother, who was completely innocent, he got\n\nback in his car and left. (RR65: 38, 48). The Appellant admitted to sitting in his\n\ncar outside of their house for thirty to forty-five minutes, just thinking. (RR65: 49).\n\n      On September 6, 2012, ―D‖ received a text message from Shania wanting to\n\nmeet. (RR65: 54). Shania told him that she was at Hebron High School. (RR65:\n\n54). The Appellant testified that he wanted to meet with Shania to ―tell her how\n\nshe ruined my life. How . . . the small lie she told took everything from me.‖\n\n(RR65: 55).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he was going to meet Shania when she was\n\nsupposed to be in tutoring. (RR65: 57). Shania told him to park by the tennis\n\ncourt. (RR65: 57). The Appellant denied having the gun with him while he was\n\nstanding outside waiting for her; instead, he claimed he left it in his car. (RR65:\n\n59–60). When Shania came out of the door, she called his cell phone and asked if\n\nthat was him with the hat on his head. (RR65: 58–59). The Appellant answered\n\naffirmatively and turned toward her. (RR65: 59). Shania froze when she saw him\n\nand said: ―Oh, shit.‖ (RR65: 59).\n\n      The Appellant testified that he told Shania he was not going to hurt her and\n\njust wanted to talk to her. (RR65: 59). He claimed that Shania relaxed and walked\n\nwith him to the car. (RR65: 60–61). The Appellant opened the passenger door for\n\nher and she got in. (RR65: 61). He denied forcing her to get in the car or using the\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fgun. (RR65: 62). However, the Appellant admitted that Shania saw the gun.\n\n(RR65: 67). He testified that he had placed the gun in the door handle, but when\n\nhe began to drive, it would slide around, so he placed the gun in his lap between\n\nhis legs. (RR65: 67).\n\n      The Appellant drove to Sam Houston Trail Park, where he and his wife had\n\nwalked the Campion Trail two or three months earlier. (RR65: 67–69). During the\n\ndrive he thought about his childhood and how his grandfather and mentally\n\nretarded brother had raped him. (RR65: 72). He also thought about his daughter\n\nand the holes in her shoes. (RR65: 72). He told Shania that he had been on her\n\nFacebook page and saw pictures of her enjoying herself while her lies had ruined\n\nhis life. (RR65: 71). He told her he had to give his Ford Mustang to a lawyer and\n\nhe could not provide for his kids. (RR65: 66). He also told her that he had been\n\noutside of her house the night before and was going to kill everyone inside. (RR65:\n\n66). The Appellant testified that he started to cry, and Shania reached up and\n\nplaced her hand on his and told him she was sorry. (RR65: 66–67).\n\n      When they arrived at the park, they sat in silence for a few minutes. (RR65:\n\n70–71). The Appellant told her that he was in pain and she should be in pain too.\n\n(RR65: 71). Shania told him that her life had not been happy. (RR65: 73). She\n\ntold him she had an abortion. (RR65: 73). The Appellant testified that, as soon as\n\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\fshe said that, he told her to get out of the car and leave her cell phone on the\n\ndashboard. (RR65: 73).\n\n      They walked to the sidewalk and down a slope towards the Trinity River.\n\n(RR65: 73–74). The Appellant testified that he told Shania to go down the slope\n\nand wait approximately ten minutes, and then she could come back up and go call\n\nher mother. (RR65: 74). The Appellant told her that he did not care what she told\n\nher mother, but she could not tell her that he had kidnapped her because she got in\n\nthe car willingly. (RR65: 74).\n\n      When Shania was about halfway down the slope, he turned and started to\n\nwalk away, but stopped, pulled the gun out of his pocket, turned around, and shot\n\nShania in the back. (RR65: 75). Shania lost her balance and fell into the water.\n\n(RR65: 76). The Appellant shot her again. (RR65: 76). He testified that he was\n\nnot sure where he shot her, but he had been trying to shoot her in the head with the\n\nfirst shot. (RR65: 76).\n\n      According to the Appellant, Shania tried to swim out of the water toward the\n\nembankment. (RR65: 76). The Appellant went down the embankment ―to finish\n\nwhat I was doing.‖ (RR65: 77). He told Shania he was not going to shoot her\n\nagain, and helped pull her out of the water. (RR65: 77–78).\n\n      The Appellant testified that Shania said: ―Why, Wish?‖ (RR65: 79). She\n\ntold him that the right side of her body was going numb. (RR65: 79). Once she\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\fwas out of the water, the Appellant told her to lie down. (RR65: 79–80). Shania\n\nwas not showing any emotion and complied with his instructions. (RR65: 80).\n\nWhile she was lying there, looking up at him, he put his foot on her neck. (RR65:\n\n80). The Appellant was not sure how long he stood there with his foot on her neck.\n\n(RR65: 81). When he finally removed his foot, he told her he was sorry and rolled\n\nher into the river. (RR65: 82).\n\n      The Appellant went back to his car, sat for a few minutes, and then left the\n\npark to dispose of the items he had used. (RR65: 84). First, the Appellant broke\n\nthe throwaway phone and threw it out of the window near the crime scene. (RR65:\n\n85). He then threw Shania‘s iPhone in a pond near his gym. (RR65: 85). He put\n\nhis muddy sneakers in the storm drain next to the pond. (RR65: 86). Next, he\n\nthrew the clip from the gun out of the window while he was driving on Interstate\n\n635. (RR65: 86). He threw the gun into a pond on the way to pick his wife up\n\nfrom work. (RR65: 86). The Appellant testified that Jawanna did not get off of\n\nwork until 9:00pm, but he arrived at 8:00pm, and sat in the car and cried. (RR65:\n\n87). The Appellant testified that he could not sleep that night. (RR65: 88). The\n\npolice came to his apartment the following day and he went with them to the\n\nCarrollton Police Department, voluntarily. (RR65: 90).\n\n      The Appellant admitted that the four video-taped interviews with the police\n\nwere full of lies, but claimed that he was telling the truth about being innocent of\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fthe sexual assaults. (RR65: 91–100). The Appellant testified that he lied because\n\nhe was trying to cover up what he had done. (RR65: 91). The Appellant denied\n\nany involvement in the crime in the first two interviews, but finally confessed\n\nbecause his mother would have wanted him to. (RR65: 91–97). The Appellant\n\nadmitted that he did not tell the detectives everything, including the fact that the\n\ntext messages were fake. (RR65: 97).\n\n      The Appellant agreed to the fourth interview with the detectives because he\n\nwanted closure and wanted to confess everything. (RR65: 100). The Appellant\n\ntestified that he agreed to interviews with Channel 4 and Channel 8 because he\n\nwanted to get everything off of his chest, and he wanted everyone to know that he\n\ndid not have sex with Shania. (RR65: 101). The Appellant testified that he knew\n\nhe was going to win if he went to trial on the sexual assault charges because he had\n\nthe recordings of Shania. (RR65: 106). The Appellant testified that the recordings\n\nshowed that her story changed multiple times. (RR65: 106).\n\n      On cross-examination, the Appellant admitted that he began to plan to kill\n\nShania in July 2012. (RR65: 108). The Appellant admitted that every time he\n\ncontacted Shania he was pretending to be ―D.‖ (RR65: 109). The Appellant agreed\n\nthat Shania had a crush on ―D.‖ (RR65: 109). The Appellant admitted that he told\n\nthe police he did not have a 903 number, he did not contact Shakeema Morsley, he\n\ndid not go to Carrollton or Mesquite, and he was not at Hebron High School.\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\f(RR65: 115). The Appellant admitted that he had lied to the detectives because he\n\nthought he could get away with Shania‘s murder. (RR65: 115, 119).                 The\n\nAppellant admitted that he never told anyone that the text messages were fake.\n\n(RR65: 112). In fact, during his interview with David Schechter from Channel 8,\n\nhe said that he had text messages that proved that Shania lied. (RR65: 122–23).\n\nThe Appellant testified that he was confident he would win at trial because of the\n\nrecordings, not because of the text messages; however, he called his attorney\n\nimmediately after he made the text messages. (RR65: 138). He admitted that he\n\nwould have used the text messages at the trial even though they were fake. (RR65:\n\n139).\n\n        The Appellant admitted that he told the detective with the Carrollton Police\n\nDepartment and David Schechter with Channel 8 that Shania had made up the\n\nsexual assault allegations because her mother made her. (RR65: 127). However,\n\nduring the conversations Shania had with ―D,‖ she never said that she lied about\n\nthe sexual assaults and never told him that her mother made her lie. (RR65: 130).\n\n        Lynne Corsi, an attorney and licensed social worker, testified as an expert in\n\nchild sexual assault cases. (RR65: 193–96). Corsi did not review any of the\n\nmaterials related to this capital murder, but she did review the files, police reports\n\nand interviews related to the sexual assault allegations. (RR65: 196).          Corsi\n\nreviewed Tom Cox‘s file and testified there was nothing substantive in the file\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\frelating to any potential defense, despite the fact that Cox had spent a year on the\n\ncase. (RR65: 204). Cox did not file any motions in the Appellant‘s case. (RR65:\n\n204). Corsi also reviewed Hugo Aguilar‘s file, and while there were notes in the\n\nfile, there were no discovery motions, interview notes, or any indication that\n\nAguilar had met with the Appellant. (RR65: 205–06). There was no indication that\n\neither Cox or Aguilar ever requested or employed an investigator to work on the\n\ncase. (RR65: 206–07).\n\n       Corsi testified that if she had represented the Appellant on the sexual assault\n\ncharges she would have immediately filed a motion for an investigator. (RR65:\n\n208). She would have met with the Appellant on numerous occasions and asked\n\nhim to bring collateral witnesses, whom she would have interviewed separately.\n\n(RR65: 208). She would have requested discovery from the State, and would have\n\nspecifically requested Shania‘s forensic interview. (RR65: 208–09). She would\n\nhave also listened to the recordings that the Appellant made. (RR65: 210).\n\n       Arty Hayes, the Appellant‘s brother-in-law and his pastor, provided\n\ncounseling to the Appellant concerning the sexual assault allegations. (RR65: 263–\n\n67).   Hayes testified that the Appellant and Jawanna drove from Dallas to\n\nTexarkana to meet with him. (RR65: 268). Hayes and his co-pastor, William\n\nCooper, met with the Appellant alone first. (RR65: 267). The Appellant wanted\n\nthem to know that he was innocent and was very disturbed about the situation.\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f(RR65: 267). According to Hayes, the Appellant seemed very concerned and\n\ndepressed. (RR65: 268).\n\n                                  State’s Rebuttal\n\n      Shirley Brown, and her two daughters Julia and Jazmine, testified that\n\nShania told them about the sexual assaults. Shirley testified that Shania came to\n\nher house crying in the spring of 2011. (RR65: 290). Shania told Shirley that she\n\nhad something she wanted to tell her but was scared because if she told anyone,\n\n―someone would come up hurt.‖ (RR65: 291). Ultimately, Shania told Shirley that\n\na man had been raping her when she was babysitting. (RR65: 292). He would hold\n\na sword to her neck and force himself on her. (RR65: 292).\n\n      Julia Adams also testified that Shania told her that a man was raping her\n\nwhen she was babysitting. (RR65: 304–06). Shania told her that he would put\n\nswords in her face and threatened that if she told anyone about what was going on\n\nhe would hurt her and her family. (RR65: 305–06).\n\n      Shania told Julia that the sexual intercourse was a ―habit‖ at first. (RR65:\n\n308–09). Julia clarified that this meant that the Appellant had already threatened\n\nher, ―so she tried to look over it, tried to cope with it,‖ but then he became rough\n\nwith her. (RR65: 309). Shania became afraid because he told her: ―I‘m going to\n\nkill your family if you tell. Remember if you tell, I‘m going to kill you and your\n\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\ffamily.‖ (RR65: 309). Julia testified that Shania did not want to have sex with the\n\nAppellant. (RR65: 309).\n\n      Jazmine Adams testified that there was a day in April 2011 when Shania\n\ncame to school dressed in sweats instead of her school uniform. (RR65: 318–19).\n\nShania told Jazmine that her mother had caught her texting a twenty year-old man\n\nand put her out of the house. (RR65: 319). Jazmine found out that the Appellant\n\nhad sexually assaulted Shania. (RR65: 320).\n\n      Jennifer Dibrell testified that she retrieved the Appellant‘s property from the\n\nMesquite Police Department following his arrest for the sexual assault charges.\n\n(RR65: 334–35). The Appellant told her not to give Jawanna his cell phone.\n\n(RR65: 335). Jennifer testified that she and the Appellant argued about him being\n\nthere when Shania was babysitting because there was no reason to have a\n\nbabysitter if the Appellant was going to be at the apartment with the kids. (RR65:\n\n337). Jennifer also testified that when the sexual assault allegations came up, the\n\nAppellant asked her to write a statement for him stating that her children said he\n\nwas never alone with Shania, but she refused. (RR65: 337–38).\n\n      Jawanna Arrington testified that the Appellant picked her up from work on\n\nSeptember 6, 2012. (RR65: 351). Jawanna noticed that the Appellant had sprayed\n\na lot of cologne in the car, and she thought there had been another woman in the\n\ncar. (RR65: 352). Jawanna testified that the Appellant was more affectionate than\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\fusual that night. (RR65: 353). They took a bubble bath, cooked dinner, and were\n\nintimate. (RR65: 353).\n\n      Jawanna testified that the Appellant never showed her the text messages that\n\nled to the sexual assault charges. (RR65: 353–54). He only told her ―his version of\n\nwhat they said.‖ (RR65: 354). He told Jawanna that Shania had sent him a text\n\nmessage asking him if he loved Jawanna. (RR65: 354).          The Appellant told\n\nJawanna that he said yes, and Shania responded: ―I wish I didn‘t have these\n\nfeelings.‖ (RR65: 34). The Appellant told Jawanna he replied: ―I can‘t have you in\n\nthat way.‖ (RR65: 355). The Appellant told her he did not want to hurt Shania‘s\n\nfeelings. (RR65: 355). They did not discuss the messages any further. (RR65:\n\n355). After the Appellant was arrested for capital murder, Jawanna moved his\n\nbelongings, including some swords, out of her apartment and gave them to his\n\nsister. (RR65: 356).\n\n                               Punishment Phase\n\n                              State’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      During the punishment phase of the Appellant‘s trial, the State presented\n\nevidence of the Appellant‘s escape from Parkland Hospital while in the custody of\n\nthe Dallas County Sheriff‘s Department awaiting trial for capital murder. Dallas\n\nCounty Sheriff‘s Deputy Steven Underwood testified that he was assigned to guard\n\nthe Appellant on the evening of December 4, 2012. (RR66: 143–84).              The\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\fAppellant was admitted to Parkland on December 1st after complaining that he\n\nwas dizzy, and was due to be discharged that evening at 9:30pm. (RR66: 147;\n\nRR68: 68; SX: 240). This was the Appellant‘s sixth visit to Parkland since his\n\narrest for capital murder in September. (RR68: 67–68; SX: 240). Shortly after\n\n8:00pm, the Appellant asked Underwood if he could take a shower before he was\n\ntaken back to jail. (RR65: 147). Underwood agreed. (RR66: 148).\n\n        The Appellant was restrained with leg restraints and handcuffs, and\n\nUnderwood decided to remove them so the Appellant could shower. (RR66: 148).\n\nOnce Underwood removed the Appellant‘s leg restraints, he sat up on the side of\n\nthe bed and turned to face Underwood. (RR66: 148). When the handcuffs were\n\nalso removed, the Appellant told Underwood: ―I‘m sorry, man,‖ and grabbed\n\nUnderwood by his gun holster and vest and backed him into the wall. (RR66: 148–\n\n50). The Appellant had some type of sharp object in his left hand and told\n\nUnderwood he would cut him if he moved. (RR66: 150–51). Underwood grabbed\n\nthe Appellant and backed him into the left corner of the room. (RR66: 151). The\n\ntwo wrestled around and the Appellant reached for Underwood‘s gun. (RR66:\n\n151).\n\n        Underwood tried to knock the Appellant to the ground but was unable to.\n\n(RR66: 151–52). The two continued to wrestle, and then Underwood heard a\n\n―pop.‖ (RR66: 152). Underwood‘s holster had broken and the Appellant had his\n\n\n\n                                       33\n\fgun. (RR66: 152). The gun was a fully loaded Glock 22, 40-caliber. (RR66: 167,\n\n170). Underwood put his hands in the air and complied with the Appellant‘s\n\ncommands to get on the ground. (RR66: 155–56). The Appellant then fled the\n\nroom. (RR66: 157).      Underwood called his supervisor and chased after the\n\nAppellant, but was unable to apprehend him. (RR66: 179).\n\n      After his escape, the Appellant fled the hospital to a residential\n\nneighborhood a few blocks from the hospital. (RR66: 187–88). At approximately\n\n8:30pm, the Appellant knocked on Mary Cassio‘s door and asked for help. (RR66:\n\n184–85). The Appellant claimed that someone was shooting at him and stole his\n\ncar. (RR66: 185). He did not have a shirt or shoes and was wearing hospital pants\n\nand hospital bracelets. (RR66: 186). Cassio, whose three teenage children and\n\ndaughter-in-law were also in the home, did not let him in. (RR66: 184–86).\n\nInstead, she told the Appellant she was going to call 911. (RR66: 186). The\n\nAppellant told her not to call the police because he had warrants, and took off\n\nrunning down the street. (RR66: 187). When Cassio went outside, she found a\n\nyellow hospital sock on the ground which appeared to contain a gun. (RR66: 189).\n\nCassio testified that while the Appellant did not show any aggression toward her,\n\nshe also testified that there were multiple people in the home, which the Appellant\n\nwas able to see. (RR66: 196–98).\n\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\f      Senior Corporal Christian Dalesandro, a sniper and negotiator with the\n\nDallas SWAT team, testified generally about the duties of the Dallas Police\n\nDepartment SWAT team, and specifically about his involvement in the Appellant‘s\n\ncapture following his escape from Parkland Hospital. (RR67: 49–71). Dalesandro\n\nresponded to a location off of Harry Hines Boulevard on December 4, 2012.\n\n(RR67: 49–50, 52).     Approximately twenty-two to twenty-five Dallas SWAT\n\nofficers were at the location. (RR67: 55). The Appellant had been located in a red\n\nAustin‘s Barbeque van parked between two buildings. (RR67: 54; SX: 292, 293,\n\n294, 295). A patrol sergeant was speaking with the Appellant, but Dalesandro\n\neventually took over the communications. (RR67: 56). Dalesandro and the SWAT\n\nsnipers were unable to see the Appellant‘s left hand and were concerned he had a\n\nweapon. (RR67: 60–61).\n\n      Dalesandro noted that there were no negotiations with the Appellant because\n\nthere were no hostages and there was nothing he wanted from the Appellant.\n\n(RR67: 57). Instead, Dalesandro informed the Appellant that he was surrounded\n\nby Dallas SWAT and was no longer dealing with the Parkland Police or with the\n\nDallas Police Department. (RR67: 59). Dalesandro informed the Appellant that he\n\ncould place his hands out of the vehicle, surrender, and be taken back into custody\n\nwithout further event. (RR67: 59). Otherwise, they would use alternatives that\n\nwould be more difficult for the Appellant. (RR67: 59). Dalesandro explained that\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\fthey could shoot gas into the vehicle which would have made it difficult, if not\n\nimpossible, for the Appellant to stay inside. (RR67: 59–60).      Ultimately, the\n\nAppellant came out of the vehicle and was returned to custody. (RR67: 61).\n\n      In addition to the evidence of the Appellant‘s escape, the State also\n\npresented evidence of the Appellant‘s criminal history through certified copies of\n\nhis prior convictions. (SX: 245–48). On August 30, 1999, the Appellant pled\n\nguilty the offense of theft $1,500 and was sentenced to five years‘ deferred\n\nadjudication community supervision. (SX: 245). His probation was revoked on\n\nOctober 29, 2001, and he was sentenced to fifteen months‘ confinement in state\n\njail. (SX: 245). One of the grounds for the revocation was the commission of a\n\nnew offense—burglary of a motor vehicle on or about January 30, 2001. (RR66:\n\n141–42; SX: 245). On October 12, 2001, the Appellant entered a plea of guilty to\n\nthe offense of evading arrest detention and was sentenced to thirty days in jail.\n\n(SX: 246). On that same day, the Appellant also pled guilty to the offense of\n\nfailure to identify and was sentenced to thirty days in jail. (SX: 247).      On\n\nNovember 26, 2007, the Appellant pled guilty to the charge of fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer and was sentence to twenty-two days in jail.\n\n(SX: 248).\n\n      The State also presented testimony concerning the Appellant‘s lies,\n\nmanipulation, infidelity and violence against women.        Over the course of\n\n\n\n                                       36\n\fapproximately five years, the Appellant had five children with different women:\n\ndaughter Kurstyne with Latrice Brown in 2000; son Trey with Linda Crawford in\n\n2001; son Ahmad with Labrena Henderson in 2001; daughter Dezire with Jennifer\n\nDibrell in 2004; and son TK6 with Nicole.\n\n         Linda Crawford, the mother of the Appellant‘s twelve year-old son Trey,\n\ntestified about several incidents where the Appellant was physically violent with\n\nher. (RR66: 80). The first incident occurred when she was seven or eight months\n\npregnant with Trey. (RR66: 85). Linda testified that she surprised the Appellant at\n\nhis apartment and found him with another woman. (RR66: 85, 101). Linda tried to\n\npush her way into the apartment, but the Appellant came outside, pushed her and\n\ntold her to ―get going and don‘t come around here.‖ (RR66: 86, 103–04). He\n\ngrabbed her by the throat and held her against the building, then told her to leave.\n\n(RR66: 86). He pushed her and shoved her away from the apartment, all the way\n\nto a convenience store. (RR66: 86).\n\n         Sometime after Trey was born, the Appellant called her over to his\n\napartment so they could be ―intimate.‖ (RR66: 87). While she was there, Labrena,\n\nthe mother of the Appellant‘s other son, returned home and wanted to know why\n\nLinda was there. (RR66: 87–88, 106). The Appellant pretended not to know, and\n\nfeeling embarrassed, Linda began to argue with him. (RR66: 88). At one point,\n\n\n6\n    The record does not reflect when TK was born.\n\n\n                                               37\n\fLinda threw a baby‘s milk bottle at the Appellant, hitting him in the face. (RR66:\n\n116). The Appellant picked up the bottle and poured the milk over her head.\n\n(RR66: 116, 118–19).\n\n      As Linda was leaving, the Appellant swung a clothes hanger at her and hit\n\nher on her arm. (RR66: 88). Linda was holding Trey, who was only a few months\n\nold, and had to ―let him go‖ to defend herself against the Appellant‘s assault.\n\n(RR66: 88). She was able to catch Trey before he hit the ground, but she ended up\n\nwith a cut on her arm from the clothes hanger. (RR66: 88). Linda‘s father called\n\nthe police and the Appellant was arrested for assault. (RR66: 88).\n\n      Linda testified that she knew the Appellant had a thirteen year-old daughter,\n\nKurstyne with Latrice Brown, another son named Ahmad, who is approximately\n\ntwelve, with Labrena Henderson, and another son named TK with a woman named\n\nNicole. (RR66: 89–90). Linda did not learn that TK was the Appellant‘s son until\n\nher was arrested in this case, despite the fact that TK and his mother lived in the\n\nsame apartment complex as Linda and Trey, and the two boys played together.\n\n(RR66: 90).\n\n      Labrena Henderson, the mother of the Appellant‘s son Ahmad, testified that\n\nshortly after she had Ahmad, the Appellant would leave for days at a time and not\n\ntell her where he was going. (RR66: 127–28). On one occasion, when Labrena\n\nquestioned the Appellant about where he had been, he got upset and pushed her up\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fagainst a wall. (RR66: 127–28).      Labrena immediately left and went to her\n\nmother‘s house. (RR66: 128).\n\n      The Appellant was also violent with his wife Jawanna. Jawanna testified\n\nthat the Appellant ―put his hands on her‖ on several occasions. (RR66: 202). He\n\nwould choke her, threaten her with knives, and on two occasions, had put a gun to\n\nher head. (RR66: 202, 209–10). Jawanna testified that the incidents would begin\n\nwith an argument, and when she responded to his anger with silence, he would\n\ngrab her around the neck with both hands and choke her. (RR66: 202–03).\n\nJawanna testified that this happened more than twenty times over the course of\n\ntheir relationship. (RR66: 204). Jawanna testified that they would argue about\n\neverything from the Appellant having a bad day to her catching him texting other\n\nwomen. (RR66: 205). On one occasion when they were arguing over her cell\n\nphone, the Appellant forced Jawanna to the floor against the fireplace. (RR66:\n\n204). She ended up with bruises and scratches on her back from the bricks on the\n\nfireplace. (RR66: 204). Jawanna did not call the police because she loved the\n\nAppellant and did not want him to get in trouble, nor did she want her family to\n\nfind out about the abuse. (RR66: 203).\n\n      Finally, the State presented the testimony of Melodye Nelson, a 24-year\n\nveteran of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (―TDCJ‖), and an expert in\n\nthe Texas prison system. (RR67: 94–156). Nelson is currently the senior warden\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fof the Mountain View Unit, a maximum security facility that houses the female\n\ndeath row population, and she previously served as the major of correctional\n\nofficers at the Polunsky Unit, which houses the male death row population. (RR67:\n\n95–96).\n\n      Nelson testified generally about the number and types of facilities in the\n\nTDCJ, the number of inmates and guards, how inmates are classified, and the\n\nopportunities for violence within the Texas prison system. (RR67: 95–156).\n\nNelson testified that, despite the security present in the TDCJ, violence still occurs\n\nin both minimum security areas and on death row. (RR67: 119–20). This includes\n\nassaults, sexual assaults, gang activity and murder. (RR67: 120).\n\n                             Appellant’s Case-in-Chief\n\n      The Appellant presented evidence concerning his difficult childhood,\n\nincluding his mother‘s murder and his upbringing in foster care. Clifford Harper,\n\na former detective with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department (―SLMPD‖)\n\nin St. Louis, Missouri, worked many crimes in the Cabanne Courts neighborhood\n\nwhere the Appellant was raised. (RR67: 166). The neighborhood was known for\n\nits gang activity, drugs, and violent crime. (RR67: 166). Harper characterized the\n\nneighborhood as one of the worst in St. Louis. (RR67: 166).\n\n      During Harper‘s twenty years with the SLMPD, he spent six years as a\n\nhomicide detective. (RR67: 165). One of the homicides Harper investigated was\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fthe February 1, 1997 murder of Appellant‘s mother, Brenda Elkins. (RR67: 167–\n\n68, 179). Elkins was raped, sodomized and shot point blank in the head with a 12-\n\ngauge pump shotgun. (RR67: 168). Harper described the crime scene as one of the\n\nworst he had ever seen. (RR67: 177). Jerry Brandon was ultimately convicted of\n\nthe crime and remains in prison. (RR67: 177). The Appellant was not present\n\nduring the murder. (RR67: 180).\n\n      Rose McGill, the Appellant‘s foster mother when he was fifteen, testified\n\nthat the Appellant was always full of joy. (RR67: 217, 221, 224). He was obedient\n\nand did not cause any disruptions while he lived with her. (RR67: 227). However,\n\nMcGill felt that the Appellant had a lot of anger because he felt that someone in his\n\nfamily should have taken him and his brother in, rather than letting them go into\n\nfoster care. (RR67: 225). The Appellant even had relatives that lived down the\n\nstreet from McGill; however, they did not want to take him into their home.\n\n(RR67: 225–26). McGill made sure that the Appellant had contact with his family\n\nwhile he was living with her, but the Appellant expressed quite a bit of resentment\n\ntoward them. (RR67: 225).\n\n      The Appellant‘s older sister, Dorothy, ended up taking the Appellant and his\n\nbrother once she turned twenty-one. (RR67: 227–29). McGill was against this and\n\nwould have welcomed the Appellant to continue living with her. (RR67: 227).\n\nMcGill believed that the Appellant‘s sister was not stable enough to care for two\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\fteenagers when she was only twenty-one or twenty-two years old, and was\n\nadditionally caring for her own two young sons. (RR67: 227–29).\n\n      While McGill noted that the Appellant needed love, he never needed any\n\nspecial resources from the State. (RR67: 239). McGill taught the Appellant how to\n\nabide by the rules, to keep his hands to himself, and to be respectful to women.\n\n(RR67: 239–40).     The Appellant was always respectful to her and the other\n\nchildren. (RR67: 240). McGill was disappointed when she learned about his\n\nbehavior when he went to live with his sister. (RR67: 240–41). She would talk to\n\nthe Appellant and tell him that he was getting on the wrong track, but there was\n\nnothing else she could do. (RR67: 241). McGill always had a place for the\n\nAppellant, even up to the present day. (RR67: 243–44).\n\n      Dorothy Elkins, the Appellant‘s older sister, testified about the environment\n\nshe and her siblings grew up in. (RR67: 246). When Dorothy was approximately\n\nthree or four years old, CPS began an investigation into the family, and became\n\nconcerned that their mother, Brenda, was not properly caring for her and her\n\nbrother Tony. (RR67: 247–48). Tony, the oldest sibling, is mentally disabled and\n\nhas been in an assisted living center in Missouri his entire life. (RR67: 246).\n\nDorothy was sent to California, where she lived for the next five or six years, until\n\nshe was nine years old. (RR67: 248). When Dorothy returned to St. Louis, she\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\flearned that her mother had given birth to five children while she was gone.\n\n(RR67: 248). The Appellant was the youngest of the children. (RR67: 249, 266).\n\n      The family lived in a three bedroom apartment in the Cabanne Courts\n\nneighborhood, where drugs and violence were common. (RR67: 249–51). The\n\nchildren were not allowed to play outside because of the violence, but when they\n\ndid go outside they often saw drug deals and shootings. (RR67: 250–52). On one\n\noccasion, people came to their apartment looking for their uncle because he had\n\nbeen selling drugs on another person‘s territory. (RR67: 253). The men shot her\n\nuncle in the leg in front of everyone. (RR67: 253).\n\n      Dorothy‘s grandfather, Lawrence, also lived with them. (RR67: 250).\n\nDorothy testified that her grandfather molested everyone in the house, including\n\nher. (RR67: 265). She also testified that he was the father of Brenda‘s oldest son,\n\nTony. (RR67: 165–66). As far as sleeping arrangements, Brenda had her own\n\nroom, her grandfather and her brother Michael shared a room, and the other five\n\nchildren slept in the third bedroom. (RR67: 251). Dorothy shared a bunk bed with\n\nher sister, while her three brothers shared another bunk bed. (RR67: 251).\n\n      The family lived there until Dorothy was fourteen or fifteen years old.\n\n(RR67: 251). They had to move when Brenda was arrested for shooting a man.\n\n(RR67: 256). CPS placed all of the children in foster care. (RR67: 251–52, 257).\n\nDorothy and her sister went to one foster home, while the brothers were sent to a\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fdifferent home. (RR67: 257). At some point, the Appellant was separated from his\n\nbrothers and was sent to yet another foster home. (RR67: 257). However, their\n\nAunt Rose and Uncle James quickly came and took all of the children to live with\n\nthem in Texarkana, Arkansas. (RR67: 258).\n\n      Their mother was released from prison approximately two-and-a-half years\n\nlater, and came to live with them in Texarkana. (RR67: 258–59). They lived with\n\nAunt Rose and Uncle James until Brenda was able to afford an apartment. (RR67:\n\n259). They were reunited for less than a year when Brenda was arrested for\n\nviolating her parole and was sent back to Missouri. (RR67: 259). Dorothy, who\n\nwas seventeen, stayed with her aunt and uncle, while her younger brothers—\n\nSammy, John and the Appellant—went back to foster care. (RR67: 260). Dorothy\n\nbelieved that the Appellant lived in at least four different foster homes during his\n\nteenage years. (RR67: 257).\n\n      Eventually, the Appellant and Sammy came to live with her. (RR67: 261–\n\n62). Dorothy had a four bedroom apartment where she lived with her two sons and\n\ntheir father. (RR67: 262). When the Appellant turned seventeen, he moved out of\n\nDorothy‘s apartment and moved in with his girlfriend, Kenzie Monroe. (RR67:\n\n263). Dorothy agreed that the Appellant moved a lot during his twenties, moving\n\nfrom Illinois to Georgia to California. (RR67: 264).       When he met Jawanna\n\nArrington, he finally began to settle down. (RR67: 264).\n\n\n\n                                        44\n\f      On cross-examination, Dorothy testified that her grandfather never forced\n\nher to have sexual intercourse, but had fondled her. (RR67: 271–72). Dorothy also\n\ntestified that during the summer of 2012, when the sexual assault cases were\n\npending, the Appellant attended Rob‘s All-White Boat party and also hosted an\n\nanniversary party at his apartment. (RR67: 280–83; SX: 300). She testified that the\n\nAppellant was happy on those occasions and there had been money for alcohol at\n\nthe party. (RR67: 283–85).\n\n      Brenda Griffin, the Appellant‘s therapist at the Youth Home, a non-profit\n\nfacility for troubled youths and teenagers in Texarkana, Arkansas, testified that the\n\nAppellant was at the facility for three-and-a-half months when he was fifteen.\n\n(RR68: 22–24). Griffin testified that the Appellant had very few ties in the world,\n\nbut was very bonded with his family. (RR68: 24). The Appellant did not have any\n\ndisciplinary problems while he was at the Youth Home. (RR68: 28).\n\n      Patrick Gill, a counselor at the Youth Home, worked with the Appellant\n\nduring his time at the facility. (RR68: 33). Gill testified that the Appellant was\n\nalways respectful, polite and did what was asked of him. (RR68: 34).            The\n\nAppellant was sent to Youth Home a month after his mother was murdered\n\nbecause he was having problems dealing with her death. (RR68: 34–35). The\n\nAppellant talked about his mother‘s death and worked on his coping skills. (RR68:\n\n\n\n\n                                         45\n\f36). Gill testified that the Appellant completed the program faster than most.\n\n(RR68: 36).\n\n      Sergenant Ed Chattaway with the Texarkana Police Department testified that\n\nthe Appellant assisted in the arrest of his uncle, Robert Elkins. (RR67: 184).\n\nChattaway was the lead investigator working on two robberies that occurred in\n\nTexarkana, Arkansas in June 2004. On June 4th, a masked man robbed a Triple J\n\nat gunpoint; and on June 15th, a man robbed an E-Z Mart and raped the store clerk.\n\n(RR67: 199, 202–03).\n\n      A Crime Stoppers tip naming Elkins as the perpetrator was received on June\n\n9.7 ((RR67: 186, 203). Based on that tip, Chattaway began surveillance of Elkins.\n\n(RR67: 204). On June 22nd, the Appellant contacted Chattaway and told him that\n\nhe had information on Elkins‘ involvement in the crimes. (RR67: 86–87).\n\nChattaway learned that the Appellant had been arrested with his uncle on June 7th\n\nfor possession of a criminal instrument. (RR67: 199–200; SX: 297). A flashlight,\n\npliers, gloves, and a holster for a handgun were recovered from the car that Elkins\n\nwas driving. (RR67: 199–200).\n\n      Chattaway met with the Appellant and was told that Elkins had committed a\n\ncouple of robberies and had raped a store clerk at an E-Z Mart. (RR67: 187–88).\n\n\n7\n Crime Stoppers records revealed that a $1,000 reward was paid for the tip. (RR67: 207; SX:\n299).\n\n\n                                            46\n\fAppellant also told Chattaway that Elkins was planning to rob an Advance Auto\n\nParts store if certain employees were present at the time. (RR67: 189). As a result\n\nof the Appellant‘s information, a small team was set up to conduct surveillance of\n\nthe store on June 22, 2004. (RR67: 189, 206).         While Elkins did make an\n\nappearance at the store that night, he never got out of his vehicle and left shortly\n\nafter the store closed. (RR67: 190–92). Chattaway and his team set up surveillance\n\nagain the next night, June 23, 2004 following another tip from the Appellant.\n\n(RR67: 192).\n\n      Elkins did arrive that night and after behaving in a suspicious manner, was\n\nconfronted by Chattaway‘s team, and ultimately taken into custody. (RR67: 192–\n\n95). Elkins had a silver handgun, a toboggan with eye holes cut out, and gloves at\n\nthe time he was taken into custody. (RR67: 196). Elkins, who was ultimately\n\ncharged with two counts of aggravated robbery, rape and possession of a firearm,\n\nand attempted aggravated robbery, was sentenced to two terms of life\n\nimprisonment. (RR67: 197; DX: 34). Appellant testified at the November 2007\n\ntrial. (RR67: 207).\n\n      James Aiken testified as an expert on the prison system. (RR68: 49). Aiken\n\nreviewed the records related to the Appellant‘s case, including the records\n\nconcerning his escape from Parkland Hospital (RR68: 49, 57, 63). Aiken testified\n\nthat an escape has to be ―diagnosed,‖ meaning that the circumstances surrounding\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\fthe escape need to be reviewed, i.e., what was the opportunity, how well planned\n\nwas it, how old is it, and whether the prison system can adequately manage\n\nsomeone who has been involved in that type of activity. (RR68: 58). Aiken\n\ntestified that an escape is not necessarily predictive of whether that person will try\n\nto escape again. (RR68: 58). Aiken also testified that as a person gets older, he\n\ngenerally becomes more compliant, especially in a super-structured environment\n\nlike prison. (RR68: 57).\n\n      Aiken discussed what he referred to as prisoners with ―juice‖ and prisoners\n\nwithout ―juice.‖ (RR68: 61). Prisoners with ―juice‖ are prisoners who can control\n\nevery aspect of a prison operation by using power and control. (RR68: 61).\n\nInmates without ―juice‖ are not movers and shakers, and are vulnerable within the\n\nsystem. (RR68: 61). Aiken testified that the Appellant‘s vulnerability level was\n\nextremely high because of the nature of his offense. (RR68: 62). In Aiken‘s\n\nopinion, the Appellant would not have any ―juice‖ in prison, and the biggest issue\n\nwith the Appellant would be keeping him alive if he was exposed to the general\n\npopulation. (RR68: 62). Aiken did not interview the Appellant, but relied instead\n\non the official reports from the police and correctional officers. (RR68: 63–64).\n\n      Frank AuBuchon, an expert in the Texas prison system, testified that if the\n\nAppellant was sentenced to life without parole and placed in general population,\n\nthe least restrictive custody level the Appellant could be assigned is G4, for a\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\fminimum of ten years. (RR68: 89).         However, in AuBuchon‘s opinion, the\n\nAppellant should be sent to administrative segregation because of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding this offense and because he physically assaulted a law\n\nenforcement officer and disarmed him in order to escape. (RR68: 89). AuBuchon\n\ntestified that if an inmate was willing to take the necessary steps and risks to\n\neffectuate an escape once, he would likely be willing to do it again. (RR68: 97).\n\nAccordingly, AuBuchon opined that the TDCJ would want to lock such an inmate\n\ndown in the most secure situation possible until the inmate presented less of a risk\n\nor no risk of escaping. (RR68: 97).\n\n      Latrice Brown, the mother of the Appellant‘s oldest child Kurstyne, testified\n\nthat the Appellant cared for Kurstyne while she served three years in prison.\n\n(RR68: 110–11, 114–15). Latrice also testified that the Appellant and his sisters\n\npaid her electric bill for her on one occasion when she had been unable to afford it.\n\n(RR68: 113). She denied that the Appellant had ever been physically violent with\n\nher. (RR68: 117). However, she did receive a letter from the Appellant in July\n\n2013, while he was in jail, in which he opened the letter by writing he was ―pissed\n\noff at you right now.‖ (RR68: 115–16). Latrice testified that he was mad at her\n\nbecause she was not getting Kurstyne to write to him while he was in jail. (RR68:\n\n115–16, 118–19).\n\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\f      Finally, the Appellant‘s daughter Kurstyne testified that she was happy when\n\nshe lived with the Appellant and Jennifer Dibrell. (RR68: 125–27). She also\n\ntestified that she had not seen the Appellant since he was arrested in this case, but\n\nshe loves him very much. (RR68: 128).\n\n                                  State’s Rebuttal\n\n      Sherry Gray-James testified about the night that the Appellant escaped from\n\nParkland Hospital. (RR69: 20). Sherry testified that her husband was at work and\n\nshe and her son Zachary were home alone. (RR69: 20). Detective Williams called\n\nher and told her that the Appellant had escaped and expressed concerns for her\n\nsafety. (RR69: 21–22). Sherry testified that she was terrified. (RR69: 21–22). She\n\nturned off all of the lights in the house and held Zachary. (RR69: 22). Sherry\n\ntestified that she thought the Appellant was going to kill her. (RR69: 22).\n\n      Sherry also testified that Zachary missed Shania, and would watch videos of\n\nShania singing. (RR69: 23).          Because Zachary is nonverbal he cannot\n\ncommunicate how he feels about what happened, but he kisses the phone when he\n\nwatches the videos. (RR69: 23). Finally, Sherry explained:\n\n      The impact that it‘s had on our life is nothing compared to what\n      Shania went through. I wouldn‘t even dare try to compare it. But\n      having my safety taken away, having my daughter brutally taken away\n      because of someone who was a coward, having my daughter‘s\n      integrity questioned, all of this loss is just compounded because one\n      person couldn‘t tell truth. Shania had no reason to lie. The impact it\n      had on me was because I raised a kid that had good values. I raised a\n      kid who had good morals. I raised a kid that the only person in this\n\n                                         50\n\f      courtroom that had something bad to say about is the person who\n      killed her.\n\n      […]\n\n      To have somebody come to your house and even contemplate taking\n      your life threatens every single fiber of your safety. Every day when I\n      leave my house, I‘m looking around. I don‘t know him. Never knew\n      him. I don‘t know anything about him. If I had known that he was\n      even remotely close to my daughter and in any arm‘s length of her,\n      there‘s no way she would have baby-sat. There‘s absolutely no way.\n\n      For that, I have to think about that every single day that a baby-sitting\n      job cost her her innocence; it cost her her life; it cost her her future.\n      Her very first baby-sitting job. And that shouldn‘t have happened.\n\n(RR69: 23–25).\n\n                          SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Issues 1-3:     The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s Batson\n\nchallenges to the State‘s exercise of peremptory challenges against three minority\n\nveniremembers. The Appellant has not met his burden to show that the State‘s\n\nstrikes were the product of racial discrimination.\n\n      Issue 4: The decision to dismiss John Bigley from the jury was a proper\n\nexercise of the trial court‘s discretion.     After receiving evidence and hearing\n\ntestimony concerning Bigley‘s work related pressures, the trial court properly\n\ndetermined that Bigley was disabled due to emotional stress and would be unable\n\nto fully and fairly perform the functions of a juror. Alternatively, any error was\n\nharmless.\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\f         Issue 5: The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s motion to quash the\n\nindictment.\n\n         Issue 6: The trial court acted within its discretion in denying the Appellant‘s\n\nNovember 1, 2013 motion for continuance. The trial court‘s actions did not deny\n\nthe Appellant his constitutional right to due process or deny him the effective\n\nassistance of counsel on the issue of mitigation during the punishment phase of his\n\ntrial.\n\n         Issues 7-10: The trial court‘s rulings on the Appellant‘s four motions to\n\nsuppress were proper.\n\n         Issue 11: The evidence is sufficient to support the Appellant‘s conviction\n\nfor capital murder. Contrary to the Appellant‘s assertions, the record is replete\n\nwith evidence showing the Appellant killed Shania Gray to prevent her from\n\ntestifying against him at the upcoming sexual assault trial, and considering all of\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the jury‘s verdict, a rational trier of fact\n\ncould have found the essential elements of capital murder beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.\n\n         Issue 12: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling the\n\nAppellant‘s Rule 403 objection to two photographs depicting the complainant‘s\n\nbody at the crime scene.\n\n\n\n\n                                            52\n\f         Issues 13-18: The Appellant failed to preserve his complainants concerning\n\nthe admission of the six audio recordings, Defense Exhibits A, B, C, E, F, and G,\n\ncontaining phone conversations the Appellant recorded between Shania Gray and\n\nhimself while he employed his false identity ―D.‖ While the Appellant argues on\n\nappeal that the recordings were admissible under Article 38.36 of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure, he did not offer the recordings pursuant to that statute at trial.\n\nAlternatively, the trial court properly excluded the recordings as inadmissible\n\nhearsay, and the Appellant has failed to show harm.\n\n         Issues 19-21: The trial court properly sustained the State‘s objections to the\n\ntestimony of defense witnesses Arty Hayes, Ashlye Sams, and Lamar Leggiton that\n\nthe Appellant told them he had not sexually assaulted Shania Gray. The statements\n\nwere hearsay and were not admissible as prior consistent statements under Rule\n\n801(e)(1)(B).\n\n         Issue 22: The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s request for a jury\n\ninstruction on anti-speculation during the guilt-innocence phase of his trial. The\n\njury was properly instructed on the law applicable to the Appellant‘s case.\n\n         Issue 23: The Appellant has not shown that the prosecutor‘s arguments fell\n\noutside the permissible areas of jury argument. In any event, the argument taken\n\nas a whole was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the Appellant‘s\n\nguilt.\n\n\n\n                                           53\n\f        Issue 24: The evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury‘s answer to\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue.\n\n        Issues 25-35: The Appellant‘s arguments regarding the punishment charge\n\nare inadequately briefed and multifarious. Regardless, the trial court properly\n\ndenied his requested instructions and properly overruled his objections to the\n\ncharge.\n\n        Issues 36-37: The trial court properly denied the Appellant‘s requested jury\n\ninstructions defining evidence that reduces ―moral blameworthiness.‖ This Court\n\nhas already considered the arguments raised by the Appellant and has rejected\n\nthem.\n\n        Issues 38-48: The Appellant‘s admittedly meritless federal constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Texas death penalty statute are presented only to preserve the\n\ncomplaints for federal habeas review. And while Appellant invites this Court to\n\nrevisit its prior holdings against his position, he provides no new authority for this\n\nCourt or the State to address.\n\n                                   ARGUMENT\n\n STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 1-3:   THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN DENYING\n                      THE APPELLANT’S BATSON CHALLENGES.\n\n        In Issues 1 through 3, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his objection based on Batson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988) to the\n\nState‘s use of peremptory challenges on veniremembers Syrene Mitchell, Louise\n\n                                          54\n\fHorsley, and Freddie Watson.

These contentions\n\nlack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and the U.S. Constitution prohibit\n\nthe use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race.\n\nTex.

Crim. App. 2008). Under Batson, a\n\ndefendant must first make a prima facie showing that the prosecution exercised its\n\nperemptory challenges on the basis of race. Reed v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n368 (5th Cir. 2009). If the defendant makes that showing, the burden shifts to the\n\nprosecutor to present race-neutral explanations for striking the jurors in question.\n\nId. The court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of\n\nproving purposeful discrimination. Id.\n\n      At the second step of this process, the proponent of the strike need only\n\ntender an explanation that is race-neutral. Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447.          The\n\nultimate plausibility of that race-neutral explanation is to be considered as part of\n\nthe third step of the analysis. In the third step, the trial court determines whether\n\nthe opponent of the strike (usually the defendant) has satisfied his burden of\n\npersuasion to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the strike was\n\nindeed the product of the proponent‘s racial discrimination. Id.       Whether the\n\n\n\n                                         55\n\fopponent satisfies this burden, is a question of fact for the trial court to resolve in\n\nthe first instance. Id.\n\n       Where the prosecutor articulates his reasons for the challenged peremptory\n\nstrike in the record and the trial court rules on the ultimate question of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, the issue of whether the defendant established a prima facie case\n\nbecomes moot. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447; Young v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1860086\"><a href=\"/opinion/1860086/young-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n866 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n\n       This Court should not overturn the trial court‘s resolution of the Batson issue\n\nunless it determines that the trial court‘s ruling was clearly erroneous. See Watkins,\n\n245 S.W.3d at 447–48. In assaying the record for clear error, this Court should\n\nconsider the entire record of voir dire.           It may consider arguments or\n\nconsiderations not presented to the trial court so long as they are manifestly\n\ngrounded in the appellate record. Id. at 448. A trial court‘s conclusion that a\n\nfacially race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge is genuine, rather than\n\na pretext, should be given great deference and reversed only when that conclusion\n\nis, in view of the record as a whole, clearly erroneous. Id.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n1. Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, but the issue\nis moot.\n\n       After the parties exercised their peremptory strikes, the Appellant objected\n\nto the composition of the jury and asserted his Batson objections. (RR53: 25–27).\n\n                                          56\n\fThe Appellant identified three African-American potential jurors that the State\n\nstruck. (RR53: 26–27). The State objected on the basis that Appellant had failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case. (RR53: 27). However, without waiting to obtain a\n\nruling, the State explained its reasons for striking the prospective jurors. (RR53:\n\n27–31). Consequently, this Court must assume that Appellant satisfied his step-\n\none obligation to make a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination and address\n\nonly the second and third steps. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448; see also\n\nChambers v.

The State’s explanations for its strikes of the three prospective jurors were\nrace-neutral.\n\n      At the second step of the Batson process, the prosecutor need only tender an\n\nexplanation that is race-neutral on its face. Purkett v. Elem, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117934\"><a href=\"/opinion/117934/purkett-v-elem/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769\n\n(1995) (indicating the State has a burden of production in the second step merely to\n\npresent a facially valid explanation for its strike); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 447.\n\nThe State satisfied this burden.\n\n                        Syrene Mitchell and Louise Horsley\n\n      At the Batson hearing, the State explained that it struck all qualified\n\nprospective jurors, ―regardless of anything else that they said,‖ who ranked\n\nthemselves as a ―3‖ or higher on question number two of their questionnaire.\n\n                                         57\n\f(RR53: 28). Question number two asks: ―With reference to the death penalty,\n\nwhich of the following statements best represents your feelings?‖ (Q. p. 2)\n\n(emphasis in original).     A ranking of ―3‖ indicates the following opinion:\n\n―Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long\n\nas the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of circumstances.‖\n\n(Q. p. 2).\n\n       The State explained that it struck every person on the qualified-juror panel\n\nthat selected number ―3,‖ including Syrene Mitchell (Juror 396-A, an African-\n\nAmerican male), Steven Sperry (Juror 1336-A, a Caucasian male), Louise Horsley\n\n(Juror 422-B, an African-American female), and Penelope Cook (Juror 149-C, a\n\nCaucasian female), from the alternate pool, on the same grounds. (RR53: 28–29).\n\nThe record reflects that the State also struck Steven Sperry (Juror 1336-A, a\n\nCaucasian male), who also selected ―3‖ in response to this question. (RR53: 16, Q.\n\np. 2). The State‘s reason was grounded in Mitchell‘s and Horsley‘s opinion about\n\nthe death penalty and is race-neutral. Courts have found similar grounds as facially\n\nneutral. See, e.g., Mathis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335587/mathis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924–25 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002)\n\n(holding prosecutor‘s explanations—that he struck a juror because she was in favor\n\nof the death penalty only in two specified circumstances and she felt the death\n\npenalty was imposed too frequently—were facially race-neutral).\n\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\f      Additionally, the State noted that Mitchell ―would hold the State to a higher\n\nburden of proof in a death penalty case.‖ (RR53: 28). During voir dire, Mitchell\n\nstated multiple times that he would hold the State to a higher burden of proof than\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt because this was a case in which the State was seeking\n\nthe death penalty. (RR22: 101–04; 148–57). The State challenged Mitchell for\n\ncause on this basis, but the challenge was denied. (RR22: 157). This explanation is\n\nalso race-neutral. See, e.g., Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 450–51 (prosecutor‘s\n\nexplanation in a burglary case that the juror would hold the State to a higher\n\nburden than proof beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in order to assess a life\n\nsentence, was race-neutral).\n\n                                 Freddie Watson\n\n      At the Batson hearing, the State provided the court with three reasons that it\n\nexercised its peremptory challenge against Watson. (RR53: 29–31, 36–38). First,\n\nthe State noted that it struck Watson because of his answer to question number\n\ntwelve on the juror questionnaire. (RR53: 29–30; 36–37; Q. p. 4). Question\n\nnumber twelve asks:\n\n      The crime of ―Obstruction‖ means harming or threatening to harm\n      another person to prevent or delay the service of that person as a\n      witness or perspective witness. The law in the State of Texas says that\n      the intentional murder of an individual during the course of\n      committing or attempting to commit the offense of “obstruction” is a\n      capital offense for which, depending on the facts and circumstances of\n      the case, a sentence of life without parole or the death penalty may be\n      imposed? Do you agree with the punishment range outlined above?\n\n                                        59\n\f(Q. p. 4) (emphasis in original). While Watson checked ―yes‖ in response to the\n\nquestion, in the explanation portion of his answer Watson wrote: ―Life without\n\nparole would be better for me.‖ (Watson, Q. p. 4). Second, the State noted that\n\nalthough Watson acknowledged during voir dire that he had heard some of the\n\nfacts of this case, he had failed to disclose this on his questionnaire. (RR38: 96–98;\n\nRR53: 30; 37). Finally, Watson also indicated during voir dire that he believed a\n\nperson charged with a crime should be released from jail pending the outcome of\n\nthe trial. (RR53: 30–31). According to the State, it struck Watson due to the\n\ncombination of these three things. (RR53: 29–31; 36–38).\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      The record supports all of the State‘s proffered race-neutral explanations for\n\nexercising peremptory strikes against the three prospective minority jurors.\n\nTherefore, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the State satisfied its\n\nburden of producing facially race-neutral explanations for its peremptory strikes.\n\nSee Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 451.\n\n3. Appellant failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the\nstrikes were the product of racial discrimination.\n\n      Appellant failed to demonstrate purposeful discrimination by the State.\n\nHere, the defendant has the burden to persuade the trial court that the prosecutor‘s\n\nexplanations for the State‘s strikes were incredible or disingenuous. Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457. The focus of the Batson inquiry in this stage is on the genuineness,\n\n                                         60\n\fnot reasonableness, of the asserted non-racial motive. Nieto v.

Crim. App. 2012). The question of pretext is a question of fact for\n\nthe trial court to resolve, subject to reversal on appeal only for clear error. Watkins,\n\n245 S.W.3d at 457.\n\n      Appellant primarily contends that the State‘s strikes must have been racially\n\nmotivated because these jurors were qualified jurors and had some characteristics\n\npotentially favorable to the State‘s position on the death penalty. (Appellant‘s Brief\n\nat pp. 53–61). The jurors‘ qualifications for jury service are irrelevant to the\n\nanalysis, however.       Factors relevant to determining whether purposeful\n\ndiscrimination has been proven include the following:\n\n      1. whether the State utilized its option to shuffle the jury panels in a\n         manner that supported an inference of race discrimination;\n      2. whether the prosecutor‘s office trying the case followed a formal\n         policy to exclude minority venire members from jury service\n         which was known to at least one of the prosecutors at trial;\n      3. whether the State exercised its peremptory challenges to eliminate\n         a far greater proportion of minority venire members than non-\n         minority venire members;\n      4. whether the reasons the State asserted for eliminating the minority\n         venire members in question appeared to apply equally well to\n         many non-minority venire members whom the State did not\n         challenge; and\n      5. whether the State directed questions expressly designed to elicit\n         grounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately, in a manner\n         that suggested an intent to single out minority venire members for\n         elimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                          61\n\fWatkins, 245 S.W.3d at 448–49 (relying on Miller-El v.

This Court looks to the collective and cumulative impact of\n\nthese non–exclusive factors in determining whether an inference of racial\n\ndiscrimination is so powerful that it overcomes the deference given to trial court.\n\nSee id. at 449, 457.\n\n      An analysis of these factors demonstrates that Appellant‘s claim of\n\npurposeful discrimination lacks merit.\n\n                                    (1) Jury Shuffle\n\n      There was no jury shuffle in this case. The parties selected the group of\n\nqualified jurors from a March 22, 2013 special venire. (RR5). Appellant does not\n\nassert or demonstrate that the venire was shuffled or otherwise arranged in a\n\nmanner to decrease the possibility of a minority member.\n\n                       (2) Formal Policy Prohibits Discrimination\n\n      The Dallas County District Attorney‘s office‘s notorious formal policy of\n\nexcluding minorities is a relic of a bygone era. It is common knowledge that the\n\noffice policy of the last several years not only forbids such discrimination, it\n\nrequires an investigation into sustained Batson challenges and authorizes discipline\n\nranging from reprimand to termination. The State asks this Court to take judicial\n\nnotice of this well-known fact. Tex. R. Evid. 201.\n\n\n\n\n                                          62\n\f                                 (3) Proportionality of Strikes\n\n         Appellant argues that even one racially motivated peremptory strike violates\n\nBatson and he makes no effort to demonstrate a pattern of discriminatory strikes.\n\nHe does not identify the size or racial makeup of the pool of qualified venire\n\nmembers. Nor does he analyze the number of strikes used by either side or how\n\nthey were used. He merely argues that the State used 3 of its 12 peremptory strikes\n\nto eliminate 50% of the African-Americans on the qualified prospective jury panel.\n\n(Appellant‘s Brief at p. 64). The State disagrees with this statistic. In actuality, the\n\nstatistical data evinces no discriminatory intent.\n\n         The data evinces no discriminatory intent by the State.                The panel of\n\nqualified jurors consisted of 49 people (45-person panel for the 12-person jury and\n\na 4-person pool for the alternates). Of these, 37 (or 75.5%) were Caucasian, 8 (or\n\n16.3%) were African-American, and 4 (or 8.2%) were Hispanic.                       The State\n\nexercised 13 peremptory strikes (12 strikes in order to select a 12-person jury and\n\none strike in the selection of alternates). (RR53: 11–24). Eight of those 13 strikes\n\n(61.5%) were used on Caucasians, 3 (23.1%) were used on African-Americans,\n\nand 2 (15.4%) were used on Hispanic jurors. (RR53: 11–22). Appellant exercised\n\n13 strikes.8(RR53: 11–24). He struck 1 African-American, 1 Hispanic, and 11\n\nCaucasians. (RR53: 11–24). The result was a 12-member jury consisting of 2\n\n\n8\n    The record does not reflect how many strikes the Appellant was permitted.\n\n\n                                                63\n\fAfrican-Americans, 2 Hispanics, and 8 Caucasians, with 1 African-American and 1\n\nCaucasian as alternate jurors.\n\n          By striking 3 African-American jurors, the State eliminated only 37.5% of\n\nthe African-Americans on the panel, not 50% as the Appellant alleges.\n\nNevertheless, the number of African-Americans struck by the State is, by itself, an\n\nirrelevant statistic. It gains relevance only by establishing its correlation to the\n\nentire panel. See Woodward v. Epps, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"67497\"><a href=\"/opinion/67497/woodward-v-epps/\"><span class=\"volume\">580</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (5th Cir. 2009) (holding\n\nthat the State‘s striking 100 percent of the black jurors alone does not support a\n\nfinding of discrimination and does not show any disparity in relation to the non-\n\nminority jurors). In the Appellant‘s case, the correlation shows no discriminatory\n\nintent.\n\n          Of the 49 veniremembers who could conceivably be chosen for the\n\nAppellant‘s jury, 8 (16.3%) were African-American. A random selection would\n\nyield either 2 or 3 African-American jurors in the 14 jurors selected (12 plus 2\n\nalternates) (or 16.3% of fourteen, equaling 2.28 jurors). See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d\n\nat 451–52 (holding a random selection from a 22% African-American venire\n\nwould yield 2 or 3 African-American jurors because 22% of 12 jurors, plus 1\n\nalternate, was 2.86).\n\n          The 12-member jury here consisted initially of 8 Caucasians, 2 African-\n\nAmericans, and 2 Hispanics, with an African-American as the first alternate and a\n\n\n\n                                          64\n\fCaucasian as the second alternate. John Bigley, a Caucasian juror, was dismissed\n\nby the court prior to the beginning of the trial. (CR3: 108; RR56; RR57: 78–82).\n\nThe first alternate, an African-American, took Bigley‘s place, meaning that the\n\nfinal 12-member jury now had 3 African-Americans. (CR3: 108). Thus, 16.3% of\n\nthe qualified jurors were African-American and 25% of the 12-person jury was\n\nAfrican-American. Accordingly, the jury had 3 African-Americans, more African-\n\nAmericans than would be expected from a random selection of the 49 qualified\n\njurors. The statistical analysis fails to show any racial discrimination, and this\n\nfactor strongly supports the trial court‘s ruling.\n\n                              (4) Comparative Analysis\n\n      Appellant contends on appeal that the prosecutor‘s stated reasons are a\n\npretext for race discrimination because non-minority jurors with similar responses\n\nwere not struck by the State. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 55–56 (regarding Mitchell),\n\n57–58 (regarding Horsley), 60–61 (regarding Watson), 62 (regarding all three\n\njurors)). At the Batson hearing, however, defense counsel failed to provide a\n\ncomparative analysis on the jurors. (RR53: 25–31, 33–38). Counsel did not cross-\n\nexamine the prosecutor about his reasons for not striking any similarly situated\n\nvenire members. (RR53: 25–31, 33–38).                As such, the prosecutor had no\n\nopportunity to respond to counsel‘s allegations. Appellant should not be permitted\n\nto raise claims of disparate treatment for the first time on appeal. By failing to\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\fproperly present this claim at trial, he denied the prosecutor the opportunity to\n\ncreate a record on the prosecutor‘s strategy, and he denied the trial court an\n\nopportunity to rule on the claim. Whether a prosecutor intended to discriminate on\n\nthe basis of race is a question of historical fact properly decided in the trial courts.\n\nSee Hernandez v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112601\"><a href=\"/opinion/112601/hernandez-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367–69 (1991). State procedural rules\n\ndemand that allegations of disparate treatment by the prosecutor be raised in the\n\ntrial court, so that they can be properly answered by the State and decided by that\n\ncourt. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 457–58 (Keller, P.J.,\n\nconcurring); Young v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147–49 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991)\n\n(Campbell, J., dissenting).\n\n      The State acknowledges this Court‘s majority opinion in Young that a non-\n\ncapital defendant is not required to raise a comparative analysis in the trial court to\n\nhave evidence of such considered on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 145–46. The\n\nFifth Circuit has applied Young to a capital case and criticized this Court‘s\n\ninconsistency in its application of the contemporaneous objection rule to Batson\n\nclaims in capital cases. Reed, 555 F.3d at 370.\n\n      This Court should explicitly overrule Young. See generally Watkins, 245\n\nS.W.3d at 457–58 (Keller, P.J., concurring); Young, 826 S.W.2d at 147–49\n\n(Campbell, J., dissenting). Its majority—and the courts that rely on it—view the\n\ncomparative analysis as merely an appellate argument that can be fairly addressed\n\n\n\n                                          66\n\ffor the first time on appeal. Young, 826 S.W.2d at 146. In truth, it is a factual\n\nallegation of unfair treatment between jurors. If properly raised in the trial court,\n\nthe prosecution‘s response may provide additional facts for the appellate court to\n\nconsider when reviewing the Batson ruling. If raised at trial successfully, the trial\n\ncourt can cure the error before trial even begins.\n\n       If not raised at trial, the prosecutor‘s mental process and the trial judge‘s\n\ncredibility decision concerning the non-strikes are simply omitted from the record.\n\nJurors are not products of a set of cookie cutters, and the unexplained decision not\n\nto strike a non-minority juror who shares one trait in common with a minority juror\n\nis held against the State on appellate review. See, e.g., Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 244\n\n(stating, ―If, indeed, Fields‘s thoughts on rehabilitation did make the prosecutor\n\nuneasy, he should have worried about a number of white panel members he\n\naccepted with no evident reservations.‖) (emphasis added).         The prosecutor‘s\n\nexplanation of her voir dire strategy and the trial court‘s ruling on the strategy is\n\ncritical to a fair appellate review.\n\n       At the very least, a prosecutor should enjoy favor on appeal when the matter\n\nis not raised at trial, much like the presumption against a finding of ineffective\n\nassistance of defense counsel.         In claims regarding violations of a client‘s\n\nconstitutional right to counsel, this Court has stated that ―counsel should ordinarily\n\nbe accorded an opportunity to explain her actions before being condemned as\n\n\n\n                                           67\n\funprofessional and incompetent.‖ Bone v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2099804\"><a href=\"/opinion/2099804/bone-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2002). A prosecutor‘s credibility is the heart of Batson review, and she\n\nshould be accorded no less of an opportunity to explain her actions.\n\n      This Court should conclude that the comparative analysis is not preserved\n\nfor review or, alternatively, presume that the comparative analysis favors the\n\nprosecutor absent affirmative evidence on the record.\n\n      In any event, Appellant has wholly failed to establish that the potential jurors\n\nwho are the focus of his Batson challenge were similarly situated to non-minority\n\npotential jurors who were not struck.\n\n                        Syrene Mitchell and Louis Horsley\n\n      As argued above, the State struck each and every qualified prospective juror\n\nregardless of race who ranked him/herself as a ―3,‖ indicating a belief that,\n\n―Although I do not believe that the death penalty should ever be imposed, as long\n\nas the law provides for it, I could assess it under the proper set of circumstances.‖\n\n(Q. 2; RR53: 28–29, 35–36).        The State struck all 5 ―3s‖ on the qualified\n\nprospective juror panel. (RR53: 28–29, 35–36). Appellant points to no evidence to\n\nthe contrary.   He cannot show disparate treatment of Mitchell and Horsley\n\ncompared to accepted non-minority veniremembers. As such, Appellant has failed\n\nto show that the prosecutor‘s explanation was a pretext for discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                         68\n\f                                   Freddie Watson\n\n      The State explained that it struck Watson because he was the only person on\n\nthe panel that (1) knew about the facts of the case, (2) wrote on his questionnaire\n\nthat ―life without parole would be better for me‖ in a case in which the aggravating\n\nfactor elevating the charge to capital murder was obstruction, and (3) he believed\n\nthat people charged with a crime should be released pending the outcome of the\n\ntrial. (RR53: 29–31, 36–38). Appellant has not shown that any other prospective\n\njurors that responded similarly, and the State finds none.\n\n      Importantly, during the Batson hearing, defense counsel did not challenge\n\nthe prosecutor‘s stated reason. Whether Appellant‘s counsel personally felt such\n\ninformation should be the basis for a strike, is irrelevant; nothing indicates this was\n\na pretext for discrimination. He cannot show that Watson was treated differently\n\nfrom non-minority venire members who the State accepted.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has wholly failed to show that any of the three jurors that are the\n\nfocus of the first three issues on appeal were similarly-situated to non-minority\n\njurors that were not struck by the State.\n\n                              (5) Disparate Questioning\n\n      Finally, Appellant points to no instances of disparate questioning by the\n\nState. Cf. Miller-El, 545 U.S. at 256–57 (prosecutors used a graphic script when\n\n\n\n                                            69\n\fdescribing the death penalty to African-American jurors who were ambivalent to\n\nthe death penalty more often than with white jurors who also were ambivalent).\n\nNor is any disparate questioning apparent in the record.\n\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       Appellant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nState‘s exercise of its peremptory challenges against three African-Americans was\n\nthe product of racial discrimination. Appellant has not shown that the State‘s\n\nexplanations did not apply equally to non-minority venire members that the State\n\ndid not challenge, that the State directed questions expressly designed to elicit\n\ngrounds for peremptory challenges disproportionately, or that a formal policy\n\nexcludes minorities from jury service. The record before this Court supports the\n\ntrial court‘s resolution of the fact question of pretext. Consequently, the trial court\n\ndid not err in denying Appellant‘s Batson challenges against prospective jurors\n\nMitchell, Horsley and Watson. See Watkins, 245 S.W.3d at 456–57.\n\n       Issues 1 through 3 should be overruled.\n\n    STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 4: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN DISMISSING\n                     JOHN BIGLEY9 FROM THE JURY PANEL.\n\n       In Issue 4, the Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\ndismissing Juror John Bigley from the jury because the court did not fully develop\n\n9\n  While Appellant refers to John Bigley as Juror Number 4, the record reflects that Bigley was\nactually Juror Number 6. (RR53: 32, 39).\n\n\n\n                                             70\n\fthe issue of whether Bigley‘s emotional state made him unfit and unable to\n\ncontinue as a juror under Article 36.29(b). (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 66–70).\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      The record reflects that Bigley filled out the juror questionnaire on March\n\n22, 2013. (RR29: 74). At that time, Bigley stated that he worked as an independent\n\nconsultant on business development for start-up tech companies. (Juror\n\nQuestionnaire). On June 6, 2013, Bigley was called for individual voir dire.\n\n(RR29: 74–155). Bigley noted that he had taken a job with a software firm called\n\nIn Continuum. (RR29: 82; RR56: 14; CR2: 314). Bigley explained that he was the\n\nchannel manager for Microsoft and was scheduled to go to training in early\n\nSeptember, but because this was a new job, other things could come up. (RR29:\n\n82). Bigley also expressed concern about putting too many demands on his new\n\nemployer. (RR29: 82). Bigley stated that he was told that the trial would be over\n\nby the first of September. (RR29: 82). During his voir dire, the State informed\n\nBigley that the trial had a firm start date of August 19, 2013. (RR29: 83–84).\n\nBigley stated that he ―should be‖ available on August 19th, and the last two weeks\n\nof August. (RR29: 83).\n\n      On July 5, 2013, Bigley was selected as juror number six. (RR53: 39). On\n\nAugust 8, 2013, Appellant filed his first motion for continuance. (CR2: 221–79).\n\nOn August 20, 2013, the trial court granted the motion and reset the trial for\n\n\n\n                                         71\n\fNovember 4, 2013. (CR2: 241). Following the continuance, the court coordinator\n\ncontacted the jurors, and of those, only Bigley indicated that he would not be\n\navailable on November 4, 2013 due to a conflict with work. (RR56: 6, 12–13).\n\n      On August 29, 2013, a hearing was held pursuant to Article 36.29(b) of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure to determine whether Bigley should be dismissed\n\nfrom the jury. (RR56: 5). The trial judge noted that he had called Bigley to discuss\n\nthe situation, and Bigley was adamant that due to his work situation he did not\n\nbelieve he could be fair and impartial to both sides and carefully weigh the\n\nevidence because his mind would be elsewhere. (RR56: 6).\n\n      The judge stated that he contacted Bigley‘s boss, Philip Hyde, located in the\n\nNetherlands, via email. (RR56: 7). The email exchange was admitted for purposes\n\nof the hearing. (RR56: 7; CR2: 313–17).         Hyde informed the court that he\n\nunderstood the importance of jury service, but explained that Bigley was vital to\n\nthe fledgling software company. (CR2: 314). Hyde explained that Bigley was the\n\ncompany‘s only employee located in the United States and was responsible for\n\ndeveloping and managing strategic relationships with IBM, Microsoft, and NEC.\n\n(RR56: 8; CR2: 314). Hyde further explained that the company planned to expand\n\nmore aggressively into the United States in 2014. (CR: 314). Therefore, Bigley\n\nwould be vital during the fourth quarter of 2013, and ―taking him out of the loop‖\n\n\n\n\n                                        72\n\fduring the relevant two week period in November would be a ―serious detriment‖\n\nto the business.‖ (CR: 314).\n\n      At the hearing, Bigley testified that he would be distracted during the trial\n\nbecause he would be thinking about the work he would need to do in the mornings\n\nand evenings before and after court each day. (RR56: 14–15). Bigley explained:\n\n―So I will be thinking of other things while I‘m – you know, if I‘m – I have to\n\nadmit to you, I will probably be drifting a little bit.‖ (RR56: 14–15). After Bigley\n\nprovided further details about his job and his duties, the following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\n      THE COURT:         Let me ask you this, Mr. Bigley. Is it fair to say\n                         that because of your emotional state, you‘re\n                         concerned that you would not be attentive during\n                         the trial?\n\n      BIGLEY:            That‘s correct.\n\n(RR56: 18). Bigley stated that ―if push came to shove, I would be here, but I don‘t\n\nwant to be here under a cloud.‖ (RR56: 24). On September 6, 2013, the trial court\n\nentered an order dismissing Bigley and replaced him with first alternate Sheila\n\nJustice. (CR3: 108).\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n      Article 36.29(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides:\n\n      If alternate jurors have been selected in a capital case in which the\n      state seeks the death penalty and a juror dies or becomes disabled\n      from sitting at any time before the charge of the court is read to the\n\n                                           73\n\f      jury, the alternate juror whose name was called first under Article\n      35.26 of this code shall replace the dead or disabled juror.

While the jury in this case was selected on July 25,\n\n2013, the jury was not sworn until November 4, 2013. (RR53: 31–32, 38–39;\n\nRR60: 35–36). Juror Bigley was excused from service, and replaced by first\n\n\n\n                                         75\n\falternate Sheila Justice, on September 6, 2013, prior to the time the jury was\n\nsworn. (CR3: 108; RR53: 32, 39). Accordingly, Article 36.29 was not applicable\n\nto the Appellant‘s case.      The Appellant, however, does not challenge the\n\napplicability of the statute; rather, he challenges the trial court‘s dismissal of\n\nBigley because the court did not delve deeply enough into Bigley‘s emotional state\n\nunder Article 36.29.\n\n      Nevertheless, this Court has upheld the application of Article 36.29 by a trial\n\ncourt faced with the same situation as the one presented in this case. In Broussard,\n\nthe trial court excused a juror after the jury was selected, but before the jury was\n\nsworn, finding that he was disabled due to work related pressure. Broussard, 910\n\nS.W.2d at 957. In so doing, the trial court relied on Article 36.29(b) and replaced\n\nthe excused juror with an alternate juror. Id. On appeal, the defendant argued that\n\nthe trial court had erred in applying Article 36.29 and should not have replaced the\n\nexcused juror with the alternate; instead, the trial court should have chosen a\n\nreplacement from the jurors remaining on the original panel list. Id. at 957. This\n\nCourt denied the defendant‘s challenge, explaining:\n\n      Faced with the need to complete the jury, and having no specific\n      statutory directive, the trial court chose an acceptable option by\n      replacing the disabled venireman with a venireman who had already\n      been qualified and accepted by both parties. We find no error in the\n      court‘s action.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\fId. at 958. This Court further held that even if the trial court had erred, any error in\n\nreplacing the juror with the first alternate was harmless, reasoning that had the trial\n\ncourt waited until the jury was sworn, the trial court would have been bound by\n\nArticle 36.29(b) and would have been required to replace the disabled juror with\n\nthe first alternate. Id.\n\n       In this case, the trial court was faced with the same situation.         Bigley\n\nbecame unable to serve after the jury was selected but before it was sworn;\n\naccordingly, the trial court‘s application of Article 36.29(b) was appropriate under\n\nthe circumstances. See also Bermea, 188 S.W.3d at 339.\n\n                                     Application\n\n       The trial court‘s determination that Juror Bigley‘s emotional state had\n\nrendered him unable to serve as a juror, was soundly within its discretion. The trial\n\ncourt fully developed the issue of whether Bigley‘s work concerns would prevent\n\nhim from fulfilling his duties as a juror. Here, not only did the trial court contact\n\nBigley and Bigley‘s employer to determine the merit of Bigley‘s claims, but the\n\ntrial court also questioned Bigley at the hearing and was able to hear Bigley‘s\n\nresponses to questioning from both the State and defense.\n\n       The record reflects that Bigley had only recently started a new position with\n\na software company based in the Netherlands, and he was the company‘s only\n\nemployee located in the United States. (CR: 314; RR56: 8, 14–15). Bigley was\n\n\n\n                                          77\n\fresponsible for creating relationships with many large companies, including\n\nMicrosoft, and Bigley noted that the fourth quarter of the year was vital to his\n\nwork, especially, as his boss explained, due to the company‘s plans to expand into\n\nthe United States the following year. (CR: 314; RR56: 14–15). Bigley admitted\n\nthat his attention would wander during the trial because he would be focusing on\n\nwhat he needed to do for work during any breaks in the trial. (RR56: 14–15). The\n\ntrial court could have reasonably concluded that Bigley would be preoccupied with\n\nscheduling meetings and making contacts during the court proceedings, and as\n\nsuch, would not be attentive to the testimony or evidence presented at Appellant‘s\n\ntrial.\n\n         The trial court was in the best position to observe and evaluate Bigley‘s\n\nanswers to the questions posed to him and his demeanor during the proceedings.\n\nBased on his observations, the judge determined that Bigley was disabled due to\n\nhis preoccupation with work concerns, which adversely affected his emotional\n\nstate, and would inhibit him from fully and fairly performing the functions of a\n\njuror. See Routier, 112 S.W.3d at 588; Reyes, 30 S.W.3d at 411; Freeman, 838\n\nS.W.2d at 774. Nothing in the record suggests that this determination was an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n         Moreover, even if the trial court erred in determining that Bigley was\n\ndisabled, the error was harmless. The alleged error involved the application of a\n\n\n\n                                         78\n\fstatutory scheme and is non-constitutional error. Whitehead v.

Appellant specifically notes that the\n\nindictment fails to allege the manner and means by which he allegedly committed\n\nthe offense of obstruction. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 70–72).

Appellant filed a motion to quash the indictment on October 17, 2013.\n\n(CR3: 127–28). In his motion, Appellant argued that the indictment ―fails to\n\nspecify the manner and means by which he allegedly committed the offense of\n\nobstruction with sufficient specificity to allow Defendant to defend himself.‖\n\n(CR3: 127).     Appellant further asserted that the phrase ―in the course of\n\ncommitting and attempting to commit the offense of obstruction‖ did not notify\n\n\n\n                                         80\n\fhim of what part of Section 36.06 of the Penal Code he was ―supposed to have\n\nviolated, who was obstructed, or why.‖ (CR3: 127–28).

Crim.\n\nApp. 1979) (murder in the course of committing robbery).\n\n      Accordingly, the State was not required to allege the elements of obstruction\n\nin the instant case. Appellant does not provide any authority which excepts the\n\nfacts and circumstances of this case from the general rule. Furthermore, as noted\n\nby the trial court at the hearing on the motion to quash, Appellant was on notice of\n\n\n\n                                        82\n\fthe exact claims against him through the discovery process as well as through the\n\npleadings filed by the State. (RR58: 5–7).\n\n      Because the trial court did not err in denying Appellant‘s motion to quash\n\nthe indictment, Issue 5 should be overruled.\n\nSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 6: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR BY DENYING THE\n        APPELLANT’S NOVEMBER 1, 2013 MOTION FOR CONTINUANCE.\n\n      In Issue 6, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nNovember 1, 2013 motion for continuance. Appellant argues that this error denied\n\nhim due process and rendered his counsel ineffective on the issue of mitigation\n\nbecause his trial counsel were unable to properly investigate new evidence\n\nconcerning his childhood sexual abuse. Appellant further argues that this denied\n\nhim a fair punishment hearing. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 73–74). Appellant‘s\n\ncontention lacks merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      At a pretrial hearing on September 21, 2012, the trial court set the\n\nAppellant‘s trial for April 15, 2013. (RR3: 4–5; RR4: 4–5). On October 8, 2012,\n\nthe trial court reset the trial to August 19, 2013 at the request of defense counsel;\n\nno written motion for continuance was filed. (RR6: 6–7). On August 9, 2013, the\n\nAppellant filed his first written motion for continuance. (CR2: 221–79; RR60: 20).\n\nIn the motion, Appellant asserted that additional time was needed to prepare\n\nAppellant‘s mitigation case. (CR: 221–79). Specifically, defense counsel noted\n\n                                         83\n\fthat they were having a difficult time obtaining un-redacted records from the\n\nMissouri Department of Social Services, which were relevant to Appellant‘s\n\nchildhood. (RR55: 4–5).\n\n      In their motion, defense counsel noted that it was obvious from an\n\nexamination of the redacted records that sexual abuse had occurred in Appellant‘s\n\nchildhood home; however, they were unable to determine ―whether [Appellant]\n\nwas abused, whether his siblings were abused, whether he witnessed abuse, [or]\n\nwhat family member did the abusing.‖ (RR55: 5). Counsel noted that these issues\n\nwere extremely important to their mitigation case. (RR55: 5). The trial court did\n\nnot rule on the Appellant‘s motion for continuance at that time. On August 20,\n\n2013, the trial court granted the Appellant‘s motion and reset the trial to November\n\n4, 2013. (CR2: 241).\n\n      On November 1, 2013, the Friday prior to the start of the trial, defense\n\ncounsel filed a second written motion for continuance. (CR3: 137–140). In the\n\nmotion, filed pursuant to Article 29.06 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, defense\n\ncounsel stated:\n\n      It has come to the attention of defense counsel that the Defendant, Mr.\n      Franklin Davis, has an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated\n      upon him. New evidence has come to light as of the afternoon of\n      October 31, 2013. This evidence is paramount to the effective\n      representation of Mr. Davis. This evidence must be investigated for\n      both guilt/innocence issues as well as possible mitigation evidence in\n      a possible punishment hearing.\n\n\n\n                                        84\n\f(CR3: 137).    No further facts were provided. Counsel did not explain what the\n\nnew evidence was, what witnesses might be needed, or how much time they would\n\nneed to complete their investigation. (CR3: 137–40). Neither the motion itself or\n\nthe supporting affidavit were signed by defense counsel. (CR3: 138–39).\n\n      On the morning of November 4, 2013, the first day of trial, the trial court\n\nheld a hearing on the motion. (RR60: 19). The court noted that the trial had\n\nalready been reset twice and that this second written motion for continuance was\n\nfiled at the ―11th hour‖ on Friday at 3:33PM. (RR60: 19–20). The court further\n\nnoted that the motion was strikingly similar to the Appellant‘s first written motion\n\nfor continuance; which also concerned the acquisition of evidence of the\n\nAppellant‘s childhood sexual abuse. (RR60: 20). The court further noted that\n\nduring a pretrial hearing on October 25, 2013, there had been no mention of the\n\npotential that the defense might need another continuance. (RR60: 20–21).\n\n      The court also noted that the Appellant‘s motion did not meet the\n\nrequirements of Article 29.07 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because it did\n\nstate that the necessary testimony could not be procured from any other source\n\nknown to the defendant and that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of\n\nprocuring the testimony by the next term of court. (RR60: 21).\n\n      In response, defense counsel argued:\n\n      MR. WYATT: Your Honor, late on the day on Thursday October\n      31st, I was speaking with the defendant in this case during a contact\n\n                                        85\n\f      visit at Lew Sterrett, first floor mezzanine. And during that\n      conversation things came to light about the defendant‘s past which\n      only the defendant could be able to address specifically.\n      This is not something that was contained in the records that were the\n      source of the Defense asking for the last motion for a continuance in\n      August. That led us to the point where we are now, Your Honor.\n      The information contained in the records that were the gravamen of\n      the motion for continuance in August, after we‘ve investigated those\n      claims made in those records from the Department of Human Services\n      in St. Louis, Missouri, and the defendant being made aware of those\n      records, on Thursday at the 11th hour, as the Court has stated,\n      information came to me, specifically to me, about the defendant‘s past\n      and things that have happened specifically to him that only he would\n      be able to testify to.\n      This is not something that is cumulative because nobody else can\n      testify directly as to what has happened to Mr. Davis himself. And as I\n      stated in the motion, when we‘re talking about an extensive history of\n      sexual abuse perpetrated upon him, only he can speak about the acts,\n      about the things that were done to him by the people who did them to\n      him, and what time, when, how all these things occurred.\n      So that is why it is paramount that the Defense have a motion for\n      continuance to further develop this issue and this evidence that has\n      just recently come to light based on that conversation on October 31st.\n      The information that we have will shed light on Mr. Davis‘s life, and\n      in context this crime, and special issues involved in this case.\n      Specifically, Special Issue No. 2, mitigation evidence based on what\n      he told me.\n      And Your Honor, because of that, and because we have proof of it\n      from or some proof of it from the DHS records that were part of the\n      motion for continuance in August, at this point in time, Your Honor,\n      we have to more fully develop that. And that‘s why we‘ve asked for\n      this motion for continuance based on the statements of Mr. Davis on\n      October 31st.\n\n(RR60: 22–23). Defense counsel conceded to the trial court that the Appellant was\n\nthe only person that had the necessary information, and as far as defense counsel\n\n\n                                        86\n\fknew, there were no other witnesses to procure. (RR60: 23–24). The trial court\n\ndenied the motion, but instructed defense counsel to have their investigator\n\ncontinue his investigation into the new evidence and provide the court with a daily\n\nupdate on the status of the investigation. (RR60: 26).\n\n                         Preservation and Applicable Law\n\n      A sworn, written motion is required to preserve a trial court‘s denial of a\n\nmotion for continuance for appellate review.

Gonzales, 304 S.W.3d at 842–43.

(CR3: 137–39).             The\n\naffidavit included with the motion for continuance was signed by a notary and\n\ncontains the notary‘s jurat, but it is not signed by the affiant—Appellant‘s defense\n\ncounsel. (CR3: 139). A motion for continuance that is not sworn preserves nothing\n\nfor review. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 29.08 (West 2006); Dewberry, 4\n\nS.W.3d at 755–56. Nevertheless, Appellant has failed to show that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his motion or that he was actually prejudiced by the denial.\n\n      The November 1, 2013 motion for continuance was Appellant‘s third\n\nrequested continuance.      Two previous continuances had been granted at the\n\nAppellant‘s request; the first continuance reset the trial from April 13, 2013 to\n\nAugust 19, 2013, and the second continuance reset the trial to November 4, 2013.\n\n(RR6: 6–7; CR2: 241). The November 1, 2013 motion for continuance contains\n\nonly general averments that new evidence had been brought to defense counsel‘s\n\nattention concerning Appellant‘s ―extensive history of sexual abuse.‖ (CR3: 137).\n\n\n\n                                           89\n\fNo supporting facts were alleged and there is no mention of the amount of time\n\nneeded to complete the investigation into the ―new evidence‖ or to locate a\n\nmaterial witness. (CR3: 137–39). Furthermore, at the hearing on the motion,\n\ndefense counsel conceded that the only person with the necessary information\n\nconcerning the abuse was the Appellant. (RR60: 22–24). Counsel further noted\n\nthat they did not expect there to be any additional witnesses who could testify\n\nabout the alleged sexual abuse. (RR60: 23–24).\n\n      Moreover, it is clear from the record that defense counsel were aware that\n\nsome form of sexual abuse occurred in the Appellant‘s childhood home as of\n\nAugust 8, 2013, when defense counsel informed the trial court that they were\n\ntrying to obtain the un-redacted records from the Missouri Department of Social\n\nServices. (RR55: 4–5). The trial court gave Appellant and his defense team three\n\nmonths to obtain the records and conduct their mitigation investigation. However,\n\nAppellant waited until October 31, 2013 to provide his counsel with this ―new\n\nevidence‖ that he was sexually abused as a child. Counsel offered no explanation\n\nfor the last minute revelation by Appellant, or why counsel and Appellant had not\n\npreviously discussed the issue. Consequently, Appellant has failed to show that\n\nthe trial court erred in denying the motion.\n\n      Appellant has also failed to show any specific prejudice resulting from the\n\ndenial of the motion for continuance. See Janecka, 937 S.W.2d at 468. Examples\n\n\n\n                                          90\n\fof specific prejudice are allegations of unfair surprise, inability to effectively cross-\n\nexamine any of the State‘s witnesses, or demonstrating that crucial testimony\n\nwould have been given by a potential witness. Id. There is nothing in the record\n\nshowing the specific facts that a witness would have testified to or what any further\n\ninvestigation would have revealed. Moreover, the trial court instructed defense\n\ncounsel to have their investigator continue his investigation into the matter and\n\nprovide a daily update on the status of the investigation. (RR60: 26). There is no\n\nevidence in the record that any further investigation conducted by the defense\n\nproduced any evidence favorable to Appellant‘s mitigation case. Accordingly,\n\nAppellant has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion for continuance. Likewise, because the Appellant has failed to establish an\n\nabuse of discretion he has also failed to show that he was denied due process. See\n\nHicks, 633 F.2d at 1148; Nwosoucha, 325 S.W.3d at 828.\n\n      Finally, because the Appellant has not established any specific prejudice as a\n\nresult of the denial of his motion, he is also unable to show that he was denied the\n\neffective assistance of counsel during the punishment phase of his trial. In order to\n\nshow that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, the Appellant must\n\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) counsel‘s representation fell\n\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that the results of the proceedings would have been different in the\n\n\n\n                                           91\n\fabsence of counsel‘s errors.

Appellant‘s contentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      On September 8, 2012, three search warrants were issued in this case. At the\n\ntime the warrants were issued, Shania‘s disappearance was being treated as a\n\nkidnapping. (CR2: 168–72, 177–82, 186–95, 200–04). Each of the search warrants\n\ncontained a supporting affidavit alleging the following relevant facts:\n\n             On Thursday, September 6, 2012, Shania Ambriehl Gray was\n      last seen at Hebron High School at 4207 Plano Parkway, Carrollton,\n      Denton County, Texas. She was attending an after school tutoring\n      class and had received a telephone call from her mother. Shania\n      Ambriehl Gray told her teacher that she was going to meet her\n\n                                         92\n\fmother, Sherry James. Shania left the classroom to walk out of the\nschool and meet her mother, who was waiting in a car. Shania\nAmbriehl Gray never arrived at her mother‘s car and has not been\nseen since her tutoring class.\n\n[….]\n\n       Officers discovered that in 2011, Shania Ambriehl Gray had\nreported several Sexual Assault cases to the Mesquite Police\nDepartment. The suspect, Franklin Davis (B/M/01171982), was\narrested and is currently awaiting trial for these offenses. Detective\nWilliams contacted your Affiant, Detective C. Cook #754, to assist\nwith the investigation.\n\n[….]\n\n       Officers obtained Shania Ambriehl Gray‘s cellular telephone\ninformation due to exigent circumstances. While investigating the\nactivity on Shania Ambriehl Gray‘s cellular telephone, officers found\nthe telephone number 903-603-8786. During the time period from\nSeptember 5, 2012 to September 6, 2012, several call and text\nmessages were made from Shania Ambriehl Gray‘s cellular telephone\nto cellular telephone number 903-603-8786.\n\n       Officers obtained the call data for 903-603-8786 due to exigent\ncircumstances. One of the numbers called by 903-603-8786 was 214-\n909-8567. Officers called 214-909-8567 and spoke to Shakeema\nMorsley. Officers asked Shakeema Morsley is she could tell them\nwho had been calling her from 903-603-8786. Shakeema Morsley said\nthat she believed this person was Franklin Davis. Shakeema Morsley\nknows Franklin Davis through her friend and work associate, Jawanna\nArrington, who is in a dating relationship with Franklin Davis.\nShakeema stated that she strongly believed this was Franklin Davis\ndue to the content of the communications, which would only be\nknown to Franklin Davis.\n\n      Officers looked at the cellular telephone data for Shania\nAmbriehl Gray and the 903-603-8786, which is believed to belong to\nFranklin Davis, and found that they had been in proximity with each\nother during the same time frame on September 6, 2012. After 5:17\n\n                                 93\n\f      PM CST on September 6, 2012 it appears that Shania Ambriehl\n      Gray‘s cellular telephone was turned off.\n\n      [….]\n\n(CR2: 169–70, 179–80; 190–91).\n\n      The first warrant was to obtain a sample of the Appellant‘s DNA and to\n\nphotograph his body. (CR2: 168–72). Police took two buccal swabs and multiple\n\nphotographs of the Appellant‘s body pursuant to the warrant. (CR2: 172). The\n\nsecond warrant was to search the 2005 Dodge Stratus registered to the Appellant‘s\n\nwife, which was also driven by the Appellant. (CR2: 177–82). A bank receipt,\n\ntrace evidence, multiple fingerprints, and DNA swabs were taken during the search\n\nof the vehicle. (CR2: 182).

The search of the Appellant‘s residence resulted in the seizure of two\n\nplastic bags containing household trash, a black spiral notebook containing\n\npersonal writings, miscellaneous paperwork, a black Adidas shirt, black basketball\n\nshorts, and a pair of weightlifting gloves. (CR2: 194–95). The clothing and gloves\n\nwere found together in a gray laundry tub. (CR2: 195).          Police also took\n\nphotographs of the residence. (CR2: 194).\n\n      On September 8, 2012, the Appellant was arrested on outstanding traffic\n\nwarrants and was also placed on a forty-eight hour investigative hold. (RR61: 227;\n\nRR62: 39–41; SX: 57, 57B). The complainant‘s body was found that afternoon.\n\n                                       94\n\f(RR62: 73). After confessing to a detective that he had murdered Shania, the\n\nAppellant was arrested for capital murder. (RR62: 112).\n\n      On September 12, 2012, a fourth search warrant was issued to search the\n\ncontents of Appellant‘s T-Mobile My Touch LG-E739 smart phone. (CR2: 200–\n\n04). Analysts were able to access and retrieve the Appellant‘s internet search\n\nhistory, Facebook logins, text messages, and several recorded phone conversations,\n\namong other data. (RR60: 252–70; RR61: 90–92, 135).\n\n      On July 31, 2013, the Appellant filed four pretrial motions to suppress the\n\nevidence. (CR2: 164–204). The Appellant alleged that the facts contained in the\n\naffidavits supporting the warrants were insufficient to establish probable cause.\n\n(CR2: 164–204). A pretrial hearing was held on the Appellant‘s motions on\n\nAugust 30, 2013. (RR57: 60–70).       Neither party called any witnesses at the\n\nhearing. (RR57: 60–70). Instead, defense counsel reiterated their argument from\n\nthe motions. (RR57: 63).\n\n      Counsel attacked the use of information provided to police by Shakeema\n\nMorsley to link the Appellant to the 903-603-8786 phone number (―903 number‖)\n\nwhich, based on cell phone records, had been in communication and in close\n\nproximity to the complainant around the time of her disappearance. (RR57: 61–\n\n63). Defense counsel argued that the police had no prior knowledge of Morsley\n\nand there was nothing to suggest she was credible. (RR57: 61–62). Counsel also\n\n\n\n                                       95\n\fargued that there was no basis for obtaining the Appellant‘s DNA because, at the\n\ntime the warrant was issued, there was nothing to compare the Appellant‘s DNA\n\nto. (RR57: 63, 65). Additionally, counsel argued that there was no evidence to\n\nsuggest that a kidnapping had occurred. (RR57: 65).\n\n      Finally, counsel argued that the fourth warrant, obtained on September 12,\n\n2012, after the first three warrants were executed, was obtained using information\n\nand evidence acquired through the execution of the first three warrants. (RR57:\n\n66). Counsel asserted that because the first three warrants were not valid, the\n\nfourth warrant was tainted. (RR57: 66).\n\n      On September 6, 2013, the trial court issued findings of fact on the four\n\nmotions to suppress. (CR3: 52). The trial court granted the Appellant‘s first\n\nmotion to suppress, in part, excluding the DNA evidence obtained via the two\n\nbuccal swabs. (CR3: 71). The trial court found the affidavit supporting the search\n\nwarrant did not contain probable cause ―as it pertains to these items.‖ (CR3: 71).\n\nHowever, the trial court found that there was probable cause to photograph the\n\nAppellant‘s body, and denied the Appellant‘s motion to suppress the photographs.\n\n(CR3: 71–72). The trial court denied the other three motions to suppress, finding\n\nthat all three affidavits for the search warrants were supported by probable cause.\n\n(CR3: 52–53; 82–83, 97–98).\n\n\n\n\n                                          96\n\f                                   Applicable Law\n\n      The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that ―no\n\nwarrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,\n\nand particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or things to be\n\nseized.‖ U.S. CONST. amend. IV. Article 18.01(b) of the Texas Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure provides that ―[n]o search warrant shall issue for any purpose in this\n\nstate unless sufficient facts are first presented to satisfy the issuing magistrate that\n\nprobable cause does in fact exist for its issuance.‖ Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n18.01(b) (West 2015).\n\n      The search warrant must be supported by a sworn affidavit ―setting forth\n\nsubstantial facts establishing probable cause.‖ Id. Probable cause sufficient to\n\nsupport a search warrant exists if, under the totality of the circumstances presented\n\nto the magistrate, there is a fair probability or substantial chance that contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime will be found at the specified location at the time the warrant is\n\nissued.

However, this Court recently clarified that\n\nthis principle is context-dependent, explaining that if the whole record plainly\n\ndemonstrates the defendant did not intend, and the trial court did not construe, the\n\n―no objection‖ assertion to abandon the earlier preserved complaint, the complaint\n\nis not waived. See Thomas v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 885 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n\nThis Court further explained:\n\n      On the other hand, if from the record as a whole the appellate court\n      simply cannot tell whether an abandonment was intended or\n      understood, then, consistent with prior case law, it should regard the\n      ―no objection‖ statement to be a waiver of the earlier-preserved error.\n      Under     the    latter    circumstances,      the    affirmative    ‗no\n      objection‘ statement will, by itself, serve as an unequivocal indication\n      that a waiver was both intended and understood.\n\nId. at 885–86.\n\n      The record in this case does not plainly demonstrate that the Appellant did\n\nnot intend to waive his complaint, nor does the record reflect that the trial court did\n\nnot construe counsel‘s statement of ―no objection‖ as an abandonment of the\n\ncomplaint. It is clear that counsel reviewed the photographs that were offered into\n\n\n\n\n                                         100\n\fevidence and had no objection to them. (RR63: 182, 197–98).              Accordingly,\n\nAppellant has waived his complaint regarding the photographs.\n\n      Issue 7 should be overruled.\n\n                                   Issues 8 and 9\n\n      In Issues 8 and 9, the Appellant contends that the affidavits in support of the\n\nsearch warrants for the vehicle and residence were insufficient to establish\n\nprobable cause because the only information linking the Appellant to the\n\ndisappearance of the complainant came from an unknown and unreliable source.\n\nThe Appellant argues that the information police obtained from Shakeema Morsley\n\nidentifying him as the individual contacting her from the 903 number should have\n\nbeen treated in the same manner as information obtained from an anonymous\n\ninformant. The Appellant contends that the police had no way of knowing the true\n\nidentity of the person identifying herself as Morsley, and additionally, the\n\ninformation she provided was unreliable.\n\n      Appellant‘s assertion that the information provided by Morsley should have\n\nbeen treated like an anonymous tip is wholly without merit. While ―[t]ips from\n\nanonymous or first-time confidential informants of unknown reliability must be\n\ncoupled with facts from which an inference may be drawn that the informant is\n\ncredible or that his information is reliable,‖ this is not necessary in cases involving\n\ncitizen informants. State v. Duarte, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 358 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n\n\n\n                                         101\n\fA ―citizen informant‖ is an average citizen who happens to find himself in the\n\nposition of victim or witness to criminal conduct and thereafter tells the police\n\nwhat he knows as a matter of civic duty. Id. at 356 (quoting 2 Wayne R. Lafave,\n\nSearch and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment § 3.3 at 98 (4th ed.\n\n2004)). Accordingly, a citizen informant is presumed to speak with the voice of\n\nhonesty and accuracy. Id. at 356–57.\n\n      The information at issue in this case came from a private citizen who was\n\ncontacted by police during the course of their investigation. Morsley was neither\n\nan anonymous informant nor a confidential informant, she was a citizen informant.\n\nThe affidavit reflects that Morsley was contacted by police officers at her 214-909-\n\n8567 number after the officers identified her number as one that had been in\n\ncontact with the 903 number. When officers inquired as to whether she knew the\n\nidentity of the person contacting her from that number, Morsley was willing to\n\nidentify herself to police and provide them with the information they needed.\n\nMorsley was anything but anonymous; in fact, the affidavit contains both her name\n\nand phone number. Accordingly, her identity is readily ascertainable from the\n\nsearch warrant affidavit. Because Morsley was a citizen informant, there was no\n\nneed to establish her basis of knowledge or veracity.\n\n      However, the affidavit does contain the facts necessary to establish\n\nMorsley‘s veracity and basis of knowledge. The affidavit reflects that Morsley\n\n\n\n                                        102\n\fknew the Appellant through Jawanna Arrington, her friend and work associate.\n\nArrington was in a ―dating relationship‖10 with the Appellant. Furthermore, the\n\naffidavit reflects that Morsley believed that the Appellant was the person\n\ncontacting her from the 903 number due to the content of the communications she\n\nreceived, the contents of which would have only been known to the Appellant. To\n\nthe extent that the Appellant challenges the affidavit because it does not contain the\n\nspecific contents of the communications that led Morsley to believe that the\n\nAppellant was the person contacting her, this Court has said that ―[t]he focus is not\n\non what other facts could or should have been included in the affidavit; the focus is\n\non the combined logical force of facts that are in the affidavit.‖ Duarte, 389\n\nS.W.3d at 354–55 (citing Rodriguez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685476\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685476/rodriguez-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2007)).\n\n\n10\n   While the Appellant attacks Morsley‘s reliability because the affidavit refers to the Appellant\nand Arrington as being in a ―dating relationship‖ rather than married, it is clear from the record\nthat Morsley was aware that Arrington and the Appellant were married. Following her phone\nconversation with Detective Cook, Morsley went to the Carrollton Police Department and met\nwith Detective Teniente. (DX: 1 at p. 28–31). During her interview with the detective, Morsley\ninformed him that she knew the Appellant because he was married to Arrington, and they were\nmarried in June 2011. (DX: 1 at p. 30).\n        And while this information was not available to the magistrate when he made his\nprobable cause determination, it shows that Morsley knew Appellant and Arrington were\nmarried, and any characterization of their relationship as a ―dating relationship‖ was either an\noversight or misstatement by Detective Cook, rather than a lack of knowledge of the actual status\nof the relationship on the part of Morsley. A misstatement in an affidavit that is the result of\nsimple negligence or inadvertence will not make a search warrant invalid. See Dancy v.

Thus, viewing the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, Detective Cook‘s affidavit contained sufficient facts and\n\ncircumstances to provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for concluding\n\nthere was a fair probability that a search of the Appellant‘s vehicle and residence\n\nwould uncover evidence related to Shania‘s disappearance. See Gates, 462 U.S. at\n\n236. Consequently, probable cause existed to support the issuance of the search\n\nwarrants.\n\n      Appellant‘s Issues 8 and 9 are, therefore, without merit and this Court\n\nshould overrule them.\n\n                                     Issue 10\n\n      In Issue 10, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to suppress the evidence obtained from his black T-Mobile My Touch LG-\n\nE739 smart phone. Appellant contends that the information used to obtain the\n\nsearch warrant for his smart phone was tainted because it was acquired as a result\n\nof the three searches conducted with the September 8, 2012 search warrants, which\n\nAppellant contends were invalid. Appellant further argues that once the evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                       104\n\ffrom the first three searches is suppressed, it leaves no legally obtained information\n\nto obtain the fourth search warrant.\n\n      Appellant‘s contentions are without merit.    First, as discussed above, the\n\nsupporting affidavits attached to the warrants issued on September 8, 2012 did\n\nestablish probable cause; therefore, any evidence obtained as a result of those\n\nsearches could permissibly have been used to obtain the September 12, 2012\n\nwarrant for the Appellant‘s cell phone. However, it is the State‘s position that\n\nnone of the evidence obtained as a result of those searches was used to obtain the\n\nfourth search warrant.\n\n      The affidavit in support of the search warrant for the Appellant‘s smart\n\nphone stated the following facts:\n\n             Your Affiant, Detective D. Williams #846, is a peace officer\n      under the laws of the State of Texas, and has been employed for the\n      past eighteen years as a peace officer. She is currently assigned to the\n      Criminal Investigation Division where she has investigated crimes\n      against children for the past five years.\n\n            On September 7, 2012 Sherry James reported that her sixteen\n      year old daughter, Shania Gray was missing. James stated that she\n      was to pick up Shania from Hebron High School on September 6,\n      2012 at around 1600 hours. When Shania had not returned home by\n      the next day, James reporter her missing.\n\n            In March 2010 [sic] Gray reported that she was the victim of a\n      felony criminal offense in which Franklin Davis was the suspect.\n      Davis was subsequently arrested for that offense in July of 2011 and\n      was released on bond in August 2011.\n\n\n\n\n                                         105\n\f      On September 7, 2012, Detectives discovered, through cell\nphone records, that Franklin Davis and Shania Gray had been in\ncontact with one another on September 6, 2012. Those records also\nrevealed that Davis‘ and Gray‘s cell phones were in the same areas at\nthe same times including Hebron High School at around 1600 hours\non September 6, 2012.\n\n       On September 8, 2012, Detective Chevallier spoke with\nFranklin Davis at the Carrolton Police Department. Davis was advised\nof his Miranda Warning, which he waived. Davis provided Chevallier\na voluntary oral statement admitting to his involvement in the\ndisappearance of Shania Gray. During the course of the investigation,\nGray voluntarily submitted his personal cell phone, a black T Mobile\nMy Touch LG E-739, serial number 205KPSL357486, for analysis.\n\n      Davis stated that he was able to obtain Gray‘s personal cell\nphone number off of Facebook. Using a false identity, Davis\ncontacted Gray using an AT&T prepaid cell phone, 903-603-8786, but\nhe used his personal cell phone in order to collect evidence about the\nprevious criminal offense that Gray reported in March 2010.\n\n       On September 6, 2012, Davis contacted Gray using his false\nidentity and arranged to meet her at Hebron High School. Davis stated\nthat when arrived at the high school, Gray was surprised to see him.\nGray got into Davis‘ car after he told her that he wanted to talk to her\nabout the March 2010 [sic] criminal case. Davis stated that he drove\nGray to the trail head for Champion Trail at Valley View Lane and IH\n635. Davis stated that during the drive to that location, Gray saw a\n.380 pistol that Davis had in his possession. At one point, Gray asked\nDavis if he was going to hurt her and he replied that he only wanted to\ntalk about the March 2010 [sic] case. Davis told Chevallier that he and\nGray got out of the car and onto the trail and then down toward the\nTrinity River. Davis stated that he used the .380 pistol that he had\nbrought with him to shoot Gray twice. Davis stated that Gray fell\npartially into the river and began asking, ―Why Wish?‖ Wish is a\nnickname that Davis admitting [sic] to using. Davis then reached\ndown and pulled Gray up on to the bank. Davis stated that he then\nstepped on her neck until she stopped breathing.\n\n\n\n\n                                  106\n\f            On September 8, 2012, at about 1630 hours, Irving Police\n      Department responded to a body that was found in the Trinity River\n      near Valley View Lane and IH 635. The female body was wearing the\n      same clothes as Shania Gray was wearing at the time she went\n      missing. Officers located a backpack near the body that contained the\n      school identification of Shania Gray.\n\n             Davis then led Detective to several locations in an attempt to\n      locate evidence. Davis led Detectives to the location where he killed\n      Gray. That location was a short distance upstream from where Davis\n      shot and killed Gray. Davis then led Detectives to a pond at the\n      intersection of Royal Lane and Las Colinas Boulevard where a .380\n      pistol was located where Davis said he threw it.\n\n            Your affiant believes that the black T Mobile My Touch LG-\n      E739 serial number 205KPSL357486, will contain evidence of\n      Franklin Davis communicating with Shania Gray and accessing her\n      Facebook[.]\n\n(CR2: 201–03).\n\n      Though Appellant asserts that evidence obtained pursuant to the previous\n\nthree warrants was used to obtain this warrant, Appellant fails to identify the\n\ncomplained-of evidence. The State asserts that the information contained in the\n\naffidavit was obtained from the Appellant during the interviews he had with\n\ndetectives Williams, Chevallier, Teniente and Griggs. (SX: 57, 57B, 57C).\n\n      The Appellant voluntarily came to the Carrollton Police Department in the\n\nearly morning hours of September 8, 2012.    He agreed to speak to Detective\n\nWilliams concerning Shania‘s disappearance. (RR61: 226–231; SX: 57, 57C).\n\nDuring his initial interview, he denied knowing anything her disappearance.\n\n(RR61: 226–31; RR62: 24–27; SX: 57, 57C). He also denied the sexual assault\n\n                                       107\n\fallegations that were pending and told Williams that Shania had sent him several\n\ntext messages in which she said that she had made up the allegations because her\n\nmother made her. (SX: 57, 57C). The Appellant said the messages were still on his\n\ncell phone, and he offered to show them to Williams. (SX: 57, 57C). After the\n\ninterview, the Appellant was arrested for outstanding traffic warrants from Balch\n\nSprings and was also placed on a forty-eight hour investigative hold. (RR62: 39–\n\n41; SX: 57, 57C).\n\n      When the Appellant requested to speak with detectives a few hours later, the\n\nAppellant told Detective Chevallier and Detective Teniente that he forgot to tell\n\nDetective Williams about recordings he had on his cell phone of conversations he\n\nhad with Shania that would prove that he was innocent of the sexual assaults. (SX:\n\n57, 57B). He continued to deny any involvement in her disappearance. (SX: 57,\n\n57B). During that interview, Shania‘s body was found. (RR62: 73). Subsequently,\n\nthe Appellant agreed to take Chevallier and Griggs to the location where Shania\n\nwas murdered and to show them where he had disposed of the gun, Shania‘s\n\niPhone, and his shoes. (RR62: 78–79; SX: 58).\n\n      On September 9, 2012, the Appellant asked to speak to the detectives, and\n\nhe was subsequently interviewed by Williams and Grigg. (RR62: 117–18; SX: 72,\n\n72A). In that interview, the Appellant provided the detectives with details about\n\nhow he murdered Shania. (SX: 72, 72A). The Appellant told the detectives that he\n\n\n\n                                       108\n\fhad set up a fake Facebook page in order to get information he could use against\n\nShania. (SX: 72, 72A). The Appellant told the detectives he used his T-Mobile\n\nsmart phone to login to Facebook. (SX: 72, 72A). The Appellant admitted that he\n\npurchased a GoPhone from Walmart to contact Shania, and had recorded six or\n\nseven conversations with her on his T-Mobile smart phone. (SX: 72, 72A).\n\n      It was this information, obtained during the Appellant‘s voluntary interviews\n\nwith the detectives, that was alleged in the affidavit supporting the search warrant\n\nfor this cell phone. (CR2: 201–03). None of the items of evidence obtained\n\npursuant to the first three search warrants were used to obtain this warrant.\n\nBecause the Appellant has failed to show that the first three search warrants were\n\ninvalid, and that any evidence obtained from those searches was used to obtain the\n\nwarrant to search his cell phone, Issue 10 should be overruled.\n\n   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 11: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n       SUPPORT THE APPELLANT’S CONVICTION FOR CAPITAL MURDER.\n\n      In Issue 11, Appellant contends the evidence is insufficient to support his\n\nconviction for capital murder because the State failed to present evidence that he\n\nwas in the ―course of committing and attempting to commit obstruction,‖—that the\n\nAppellant‘s motive in murdering Shania was to prevent her future testimony\n\nagainst him in his trial for the four sexual assault offenses. (Appellant‘s Brief at p.\n\n81). Instead, Appellant argues that he murdered Shania because she ruined his life\n\nby lying about the sexual assaults. (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 81). The Appellant\n\n                                         109\n\ffurther argues that because he murdered her out of anger and revenge, he is guilty\n\nonly of first degree murder, not capital murder. (Appellant‘s Brief at p. 86).\n\nContrary to these claims, the evidence is legally sufficient to support the\n\nAppellant‘s conviction for capital murder.\n\n                                 Standard of Review\n\n      When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate\n\ncourt considers all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to\n\ndetermine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\n\nof the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Crim. App. 1993)).\n\n                                    Application\n\n      Contrary to the Appellant‘s assertions, the record is replete with evidence\n\nshowing that the Appellant‘s motive for murdering Shania was to prevent her from\n\ntestifying against him at his upcoming sexual assault trial. In fact, the evidence\n\nrevealed that the Appellant adopted an elaborate scheme in an effort to influence\n\n\n\n\n                                        111\n\fthe upcoming trial, and when he was ultimately unable to get the results he desired,\n\nthe Appellant eliminated Shania as a witness.\n\n      The evidence showed that in April 2011 Shania made an outcry of sexual\n\nassault, telling her mother that the Appellant had assaulted her while she was\n\nbabysitting his daughter and two other children. As a result of that admission, the\n\nAppellant was indicted on four counts of sexual assault of a child in August 2011.\n\n      On July 24, 2012, the Appellant had a court setting for the sexual assault\n\ncases. (SX: 20 at p. 1). Roughly one week before that court date, the Appellant\n\nconducted multiple Google searches concerning the legality of recording phone\n\nconversations and using them as evidence in court. (SX: 43, 44). The Appellant\n\nalso searched Google for the ―best way to get off of a sexual assault charge.‖ (SX:\n\n44). Six minutes after that query, the Appellant conducted another Google search,\n\nthis time for: ―With no proof that you did the murder can you still be held in jail‖.\n\n(SX: 44).\n\n      At approximately the same time, the Appellant began to look for Shania on\n\nMySpace and Facebook.        However, Shania‘s MySpace page was no longer\n\nupdated, and her Facebook page was private. The Appellant began to look for\n\nways to access her account. First, he created a fake Facebook profile under the\n\nname Jazmine Brown and tried to communicate with Shania. Shania, however, did\n\nnot accept the friend request from Jazmine. Next, the Appellant contacted his\n\n\n\n                                        112\n\fnephew Domee Elkins for access to his Facebook page. The Appellant chose\n\nElkins because he was young and handsome. The Appellant sent Shania a friend\n\nrequest under Elkins‘ profile, and she accepted.\n\n      As a result, the Appellant was able to gain access to Shania‘s Facebook page\n\nand found her phone number. The Appellant then contacted her by text message\n\nusing the ―throwaway phone‖ he purchased at Walmart. The Appellant told her he\n\nwas a relative of Elkins, and had seen her Facebook page because she was\n\n―friends‖ with Elkins. The Appellant told her his name was Artis Powell and he\n\nwas interested in getting to know her. The Appellant told Shania his middle name\n\nwas Dwayne, and he went by ―D.‖ The Appellant had previously looked for a\n\nFacebook profile belonging to someone that looked similar to him in appearance,\n\nand had decided on Artis Powell. Shania immediately sent a text message back,\n\nand he told her if she wanted to see what he looked like, she should visit Powell‘s\n\nFacebook page. Earlier that evening, the Appellant sent Powell a message from\n\nthe Jazmine Brown Facebook page, warning Powell not to respond to any\n\nmessages from Shania because she was underage.\n\n      On July 17, 18, and 19, the Appellant called Shania on the ―throwaway‖\n\nphone, pretending to be ―D.‖ The Appellant recorded the conversations with his T-\n\nMobile smart phone and attempted to elicit statements from Shania that were\n\ninconsistent with the statements she made to police during the sexual assault\n\n\n\n                                        113\n\finvestigation. The Appellant also attempted to gain information he could use to\n\nimpeach her credibility at trial and attack her character. Specifically, the Appellant\n\nasked her to tell him about her previous sexual relationships. The Appellant also\n\nattempted to manipulate Shania into not testifying by suggesting that she could go\n\nto prison if she was caught lying about the sexual assaults, and further suggested\n\nthat she could be in danger if she testified at trial because the man she made the\n\nallegations against might hold a grudge against her if he went to prison and might\n\ncome after her when he was released. When Shania told him that she just wanted\n\neverything ―over and done with‖ the Appellant suggest that she tell the police she\n\nlied and then the charges would be dropped. (SX: 19, 19C). The Appellant assured\n\nher that she would not get in trouble because she was a minor. Shania never\n\nrecanted the allegations.\n\n      In August 2012, the Appellant was notified that his trial was set for October\n\n29, 2012. On August 27, 2012, the Appellant downloaded an application onto his\n\nT-Mobile smart phone called ―Fake Call & SMS & Call Log.‖ The application\n\npermitted the user to create fake text messages and call logs. Thirty minutes after\n\ninstalling the application, the Appellant created three fake text messages purporting\n\nto be from Shania. The second message stated: ―Sorry I li3d on u but my momma\n\nmad3 m3 do it. If we go to court ima t3ll th3m u never touched me. My my\n\nmomma go b3 mad @ m3 but fuck that bitch I can‘t stand her no ways. Please\n\n\n\n                                         114\n\f4give me.‖ (SX: 43). Three minutes after creating the fake text messages, the\n\nAppellant called his attorney Hugo Aguilar. (SX: 43). The following day, the\n\nAppellant created three more text messages also purporting to be from Shania. He\n\nalso created an incoming call log, to make it appear that Shania had called him.\n\nOn August 30, 2012, the Appellant purchased a Diamondback .380 handgun and\n\nreinitiated contact with Shania under his false identity. The two agreed to meet\n\nafter school on September 6, 2012.\n\n      The Appellant testified that Shania was scared when she came out of her\n\nschool to meet ―D‖ but and saw him. Instead, the Appellant testified that he did\n\nnot have the gun out at the time, but claimed that Shania agreed to get in the car\n\nwith him. The Appellant testified that he told her he wanted to talk to her about\n\nthe sexual assault allegations. Once she was in the car, the Appellant drove to Sam\n\nHouston Trail Park.     Once there the Appellant made Shania walk down an\n\nembankment to the Trinity River, where he shot her twice and stood on her throat\n\nuntil she stopped breathing. He then rolled her body into the river and left the park\n\nto dispose of the evidence.\n\n      When he was questioned by detectives with the Carrollton Police\n\nDepartment, the Appellant denied any involvement in Shania‘s disappearance and\n\ntold the police that he was innocent of the sexual assault charges. The Appellant\n\ntold them that Shania had sent him text messages recanting the allegations. Even\n\n\n\n                                        115\n\fafter confessing to Shania‘s murder, the Appellant still relied on the text messages,\n\nnever once admitting that they were fake.\n\n      The elaborate nature and timing of the Appellant‘s scheme support the\n\nconclusion that the Appellant was trying to influence the upcoming trial. The jury\n\ncould have rationally concluded that when the Appellant was ultimately unable to\n\nmanipulate Shania into recanting the allegations or gain the information he was\n\nlooking for, he eliminated her as a witness. While the Appellant claimed he\n\nmurdered her for revenge, the jury was certainly free to reject the Appellant‘s\n\ntestimony. Lancon v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769396\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769396/lancon-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008)) (―[T]he\n\ntrier of fact is the sole judge of the witnesses‘ credibility and is free to accept or\n\nreject any or all of the evidence presented by either side.‖).        The Appellant\n\nadmittedly lied throughout the investigation, and in fact, never told anyone that the\n\ntext messages from Shania were fake until he was confronted with the results of\n\nthe forensic examination of his phone.         The Appellant even testified that he\n\nintended to use them as evidence at the trial knowing they were fake.\n\n      Considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury‘s verdict,\n\na rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of capital murder\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. As such, the evidence is legally sufficient to support\n\nthe conviction. The State asks this Court to overrule Issue 11.\n\n\n\n\n                                         116\n\fSTATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 12: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN OVERRULING\n   THE APPELLANT’S OBJECTION TO STATE’S EXHIBIT NUMBERS 40 AND 41.\n\n      In Issue 12, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nRule 403 objection to State‘s Exhibits 40 and 41, two photographs depicting the\n\nvictim‘s body at the crime scene. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 91–94). Appellant‘s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                 Pertinent Facts\n\n      During the testimony of Farmers Branch Police Officer Austin Tapp at\n\nAppellant‘s trial, the State offered State‘s Exhibits 38 through 41, photographs\n\ndepicting the terrain where Shania‘s body was found and the condition of her body\n\nfloating in the river. (RR61: 115–20). While defense counsel did not object to the\n\nadmission of State‘s Exhibits 38 and 39, counsel objected to the admission of\n\nState‘s Exhibits 40 and 41. (RR61: 116). Specifically, defense counsel argued:\n\n      MR. HAYES: Your Honor, we have no objection to State‘s Exhibits\n      38 and 39. I believe that they do show the terrain which the State is\n      attempting to get at.\n\n      40 and 41, we do object to. I don‘t – they‘re pictures of the body\n      floating in the river. I don‘t believe that there‘s a probative value\n      added to the testimony at this time. I simply believe it‘s a prejudicial\n      photograph and it doesn‘t really seem to add anything to the\n      testimony, the terrain or the environment.\n\n      I‘d ask the Court to take a look at them and do a 403 balancing test on\n      40 and 41, Your Honor.\n\n\n\n\n                                        117\n\f(RR61: 116).      After reviewing the challenged photographs, the trial court\n\nconcluded that the probative value of State‘s Exhibits 40 and 41 substantially\n\noutweighed the prejudicial effect, overruled the objection, and admitted the\n\nphotographs into evidence.

(Appellant‘s Brief at pp.\n\n93–94). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the complained-of\n\nphotographs.\n\n       State‘s Exhibits 40 and 41 are two color photographs measuring 8 ½ by 11\n\ninches. The photographs depict Shania‘s clothed body floating face-down in the\n\nTrinity River. The photographs were admitted during the testimony of Officer\n\nTapp, the first officer to arrive at the crime scene. (RR61: 108–13). Officer Tapp\n\ntestified that he was on bike patrol on the afternoon of September 6, 2012, when he\n\nreceived a call from dispatch sending him to investigate a possible person floating\n\nin the Trinity River near the intersection of Interstate 635 and Valley View Lane.\n\n(RR61: 109–10). When Officer Tapp arrived at the location, he observed a body in\n\nthe water that did not appear to be moving. (RR61: 110). Once Officer Tapp was\n\nable to climb down the steep embankment to the river, he was able to see that the\n\nbody was a female with a wound to the lower left side of her back. (RR61: 111–\n\n12).\n\n       State‘s Exhibits 38, 39, 40, and 41 were used by Officer Tapp to help the\n\njury understand the crime scene‘s difficult terrain as well as the condition of\n\n\n\n                                         120\n\fShania‘s body when it was found. (RR61: 118–21). State‘s Exhibit 40 shows\n\nShania‘s clothed body floating face-down in the river. (SX: 40). The back of her t-\n\nshirt is slightly raised and a wound is visible to her lower back. (SX: 40). Officer\n\nTapp noted that he was able to determine the body belonged to a female because of\n\nthe braided hair, but was unable to determine an approximate age because the body\n\nhad ―swelled up‖ from being in the water. (RR61: 119–20). Officer Tapp noted\n\nthat he noticed the wound to her back because of ―bubbles‖ forming in the area of\n\nthe wound and fly activity. (RR61: 120). State‘s Exhibit 41 is a closer view of\n\nShania‘s body and its position in the water, and the wound to her back is more\n\nvisible. (SX: 41). Officer Tapp used the photographs to point out the wound.\n\n(RR61: 120).\n\n      While gruesome, the photographs are not unduly so, and are relevant\n\nbecause they accurately reflect the location and state of Shania‘s body when it was\n\ndiscovered, as well as the injuries inflicted on it.

(RR63: 97). The State objected to the admission of the recordings, and a\n\nhearing was held outside the presence of the jury. (RR63: 97–113). At the hearing,\n\nthe State informed the trial court about the contents of each recording and\n\npresented its objections to each of the seven recordings individually. (RR63: 97–\n\n113). The recordings were identified as Defense Exhibits A through G.

The call, however, goes directly to Shania‘s voicemail. (RR63: 102). The\n\nState raised hearsay and Rule 403 objections. (RR63: 102). Defense counsel\n\noffered no theory of admissibility or response to the State‘s objections. (RR63:\n\n102). The trial court sustained the State‘s objections.

The trial court sustained the\n\nState‘s objections. (RR63: 104).\n\n       Defense Exhibit C contains a conversation, lasting approximately ten\n\nminutes, in which Shania told ―D‖ about the first time she had sex and about other\n\nsexual relationships. (RR63: 104). The State raised hearsay, Rule 403 and Rule\n\n412 objections. (RR62: 105). Defense counsel argued that the recording was\n\noffered to impeach previous statements made by Shania concerning her sexual\n\nhistory. (RR63: 105). The State countered by stating that there was no evidence\n\npresently before the jury that this recording would contradict. (RR63: 106).\n\n       Defense Exhibit D11 was a five second unintelligible recording. (RR63:\n\n106).

Defense counsel reasserted their previous theories of\n\nadmissibility that the recording was offered for purposes of impeaching statements\n\nmade by Shania in the DCAC interview, in the REACH Clinic report, and in the\n\nMesquite Police Department report. (RR63: 107). The State responded that there\n\nhad not been any presentation of evidence from the REACH exam or from the\n\nDCAC interview. (RR63: 108–09). The State noted that the only mention of the\n\nDCAC interview occurred during defense counsel‘s cross-examination of the\n\npolice officers and they could not use that cross-examination to ―open their own\n\ndoor.‖ (RR63: 108–09).

The\n\nState raised hearsay and relevancy objections. (RR63: 109–11). Defense counsel\n\nresponded that the recording should be admitted under the rule of optional\n\ncompleteness. (RR63: 111).       The trial court sustained the State‘s objections.\n\n(RR63: 111).\n\n\n\n\n                                        125\n\f      Defense Exhibit G contains a conversation about an audition Shania was\n\npreparing for.

Defense counsel re-\n\nurged their previous arguments for the admissibility of the recordings. (RR63:\n\n112). The trial court sustained the State‘s objections.

In some cases, another notion of preservation comes into play, known\n\nas ―party responsibility.‖ Reyna, 168 S.W.3d at 176–77 (finding that the defendant\n\nwas responsible for informing the court of a constitutional basis for the admission\n\nof evidence he sponsored; his evidentiary argument did not preserve the\n\nconstitutional error). The basis for party responsibility is Appellate Rule 33.1. Id.\n\nat 177; Tex. R. App. P. 33.1. The rule provides that as a prerequisite to presenting\n\na complaint for appellate review, the record must show that the party ―stated the\n\n\n\n                                        126\n\fgrounds for the ruling that [he] sought from the trial court with sufficient\n\nspecificity to make the trial court aware of the complaint.‖ Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a)(1). This means that it is not enough for the proponent of the evidence to\n\ntell the court that the evidence is admissible, but the proponent must have told the\n\ncourt why the evidence was admissible. Reyna, 168 S.W.3d at 177.\n\n        While a reviewing court may uphold a trial court‘s ruling on the admission\n\nor exclusion of evidence on any legal theory or basis application to the case, it may\n\nnot reverse a trial court‘s ruling on any theory or basis that might have been\n\napplicable but was not raised at trial.

Crim. App. 1999).\n\n      Hearsay is defined as ―a statement, other than one made by the declarant\n\nwhile testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted.‖ Tex. R. Evid. 801(d). The matter asserted is defined as ―any\n\nmatter explicitly asserted, and any matter implied by a statement, if the probative\n\n\n\n                                         129\n\fvalue of the statement as offered flows from declarant‘s belief as to the matter.‖\n\nTex. R. Evid. 801(c). Hearsay statements are not admissible except as provided by\n\nstatute or by the rules of evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 802.\n\n                                    Application\n\n      As noted above, evidence that is offered under Article 38.36 must still meet\n\nthe admissibility requirements of the Texas Rules of Evidence. Garcia, 201\n\nS.W.3d at 702–05; Smith, 5 S.W.3d at 679. Therefore, even if the recordings were\n\nadmissible under Article 38.36, which the State does not concede, the recordings\n\nwere properly excluded as hearsay. The Appellant has failed to identify any\n\nexception to the hearsay rule which would have permitted the admission of the\n\nrecordings of Shania telling the Appellant about her church activities, babysitting,\n\nor singing.     These recordings were not excited utterances, present sense\n\nimpressions or statements of Shania‘s state of mind. See Tex. R. Evid. 803.\n\n      While the Appellant argues that the recordings of Shania discussing her past\n\nsexual relationships were admissible under the ―state of mind‖ exception to the\n\nhearsay rule, this claim is without merit. The ―state of mind‖ exception creates an\n\nexception to the hearsay rule for a ―statement of the declarant‘s then existing state\n\nof mind . . . but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact\n\nremembered or believed . . . .‖ Tex. R. Evid. 803(3). The statements made by\n\nShania about her past sexual relationships were descriptions of past events—of\n\n\n\n                                         130\n\ffacts remembered. These types of statement are specifically excluded from the\n\nstate of mind exception. Tex. R. Evid. 803(3); see Glover v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376377\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376377/glover-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n762–63 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2002, no pet.). Consequently, the statements were\n\nnot admissible under the state of mind exception.\n\n      Moreover, it is clear that the Appellant offered the recordings for the express\n\npurpose of disparaging Shania‘s character in front of the jury. He wanted to call\n\nattention to the fact that Shania had sexual relationships with other men prior to the\n\nsexual assaults. The trial court properly excluded the recordings.\n\n      Regardless, the Appellant suffered no harm from the court‘s exclusion of the\n\nrecordings. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). The record reflects that Appellant testified\n\nabout the contents of the recordings on cross-examination:\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. So now we talk about these seven text\n      messages -- or these seven voice recordings. The first one just goes to\n      voice mail. It‘s just the phone ringing?\n\n      APPELLANT: Right.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. So tell these folks why it‘s so important\n      when you we‘re talking about how there‘s seven phone recordings and\n      I‘m hiding stuff, what‘s so important about that?\n\n      APPELLANT: Nothing on -- about that one.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: But that isn‘t what you told these folks.\n\n      APPELLANT: I told them that it was a few text messages -- I mean a\n      few recordings that don‘t prove anything, it‘s just her voice mail. It\n      was one where I was saying I‘m -- this is my name, whatever the –\n      I‘m fixing to prove my innocence in sexual assault charges.\n\n                                         131\n\fMR. BIRMINGHAM: And that‘s all it says?\n\nAPPELLANT: On those two or maybe three of them, yes.\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. So when y‘all throw the number around\nlike there‘s six or seven, there‘s about really three, right?\n\nAPPELLANT: But it was a total of six or seven that was on the\nphone.\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: Here‘s the bombshell, right, here‘s the\nbombshell that you were so desperate to get out: Shania snuck off\nwith a boy and had sex with him and got caught by her mother, right?\n\nAPPELLANT: At what point? Which one are you talking about?\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: The one where she was supposed to be at the\ntrack meet. Do you recall that?\n\nAPPELLANT: I recall that she did not get caught by her mom, she\nactually got -- they got pulled over after they was on the way back to\nthe school.\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: And the deal is that the police were right there,\nand Shania‘s mom eventually found out about that. She told you that,\nright?\n\n[…]\n\nMR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. The other thing that‘s on there is that\nthis other one is, you know, she had sex with a guy that was in the\nArmy that was 20 years old.\n\nAPPELLANT: The same guy that I actually spoke to when I went to -\n- when I first got arrested on the sexual assault charges and I told\nDetective Snyder then that she had made a mention about a guy that\nshe had sex with that was in the Army. She told me she had sex when\nshe was 13 years old.\n\n\n\n                                 132\n\f      MR. BIRMINGHAM: So that, that is what you want this jury so\n      desperately to hear --\n\n      APPELLANT: That‘s the --\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: -- that Shania had sex with somebody while\n      she was supposed to be at a track meet and that she had sex with a\n      dude that was in the Army -- supposedly in the Army who was about\n      20 years old, right?\n\n      APPELLANT: The one at the track meet, no; but the one about the\n      guy at -- the Army guy, yes.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Okay. You also talked to her whenever you‘re\n      -- in the video -- in the audio recording that we do have, these tactics\n      that you have with her, you‘re –you can see what you‘re trying to do\n      as far as building character evidence. That‘s why you tell her, ―Hey, I\n      guess it‘s good then that you weren‘t a virgin because that‘s a grown-\n      ass man‘s penis.‖\n\n      APPELLANT: Sounds about right.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Yeah. Those are your words.\n\n      APPELLANT: Yeah, that‘s what I‘m saying. Sounds about what I\n      said.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: Because you‘re trying to get her to admit that\n      she wasn‘t a virgin, right?\n\n      APPELLANT: Pretty much, yeah.\n\n(RR65: 130–35). Accordingly, the same or essentially the same evidence was\n\nplaced in front of the jury. This Court should overrule Issues 13 through 18.\n\n\n\n\n                                        133\n\f     STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 19, 20, 21: THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT ERR IN\n      SUSTAINING THE STATE’S OBJECTION TO THE PROFFERED TESTIMONY OF\n                                                   12\n     DEFENSE WITNESSES ARTY HAYES, ASHLYE SAMS AND LAMAR LEGGITON.\n\n        In Issues 19, 20, and 21, the Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\nsustaining the State‘s objections to the proffered testimony of defense witnesses\n\nArty Hayes, Ashlye Sams, and Lamar Leggiton. The Appellant contends that all\n\nthree witnesses should have been permitted to testify concerning statements the\n\nAppellant made to each of them in which he denied sexually assaulting Shania\n\nGray. The Appellant contends the statements were not hearsay because they were\n\nadmissible under Rule 801(e)(1)(B) as the Appellant‘s prior consistent statements.\n\nAppellant‘s contentions are without merit and these three issues should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                                      Applicable Law\n\n        Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying\n\nat trial, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Tex. R. Evid.\n\n801(d). Hearsay statements are not admissible except as provided by statute or by\n\nthe rules of evidence. Tex. R. Evid. 802. Generally, a witness‘s prior statement\n\nthat is consistent with the witness‘s trial testimony is inadmissible hearsay. Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 613(c). However, a statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies at the\n\ntrial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the\n\n12\n  In his brief, the Appellant cites to the name ―Ashley Sims;‖ however, the record reflects the\ncorrect spelling of this witness‘s name to be ―Ashlye Sams.‖\n\n\n                                             134\n\fstatement is consistent with the declarant‘s testimony and is offered to rebut an\n\nexpress or implied charge against the declarant of recent fabrication, improper\n\ninfluence, or motive. Tex. R. Evid. 801(e)(1)(B). The United States Supreme\n\nCourt has set out, and this Court has approved, four requirements that must be met\n\nfor prior consistent statements to be admissible:\n\n      (1)    the declarant must testify at trial and be subject to cross-\n             examination;\n      (2)    there must be an express or implied charge of recent fabrication\n             or improper influence or motive of the declarant‘s testimony by\n             the opponent;\n      (3)    the proponent must offer a prior statement that is consistent\n             with the declarant‘s challenged in-court testimony; and,\n      (4)    the prior consistent statement must be made prior to the time\n             that the supposed motive to falsify arose.\nHammons v.

WYATT: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n      THE COURT: Are you going to proffer expected testimony?\n\n      MR. WYATT: Yes. The witness that will be called is Pastor Arty\n      Hayes from Texarkana. He is the brother-in-law of Franklin Davis.\n      The testimony that we anticipate coming from Mr. Hayes is about\n      what Franklin Davis did in the meantime after the sexual assaults\n      arose but before the murder case and what he had done to counsel\n      Frank, what he had talked about with Frank, but -- and we believe all\n      that is absolutely admissible.\n\n\n\n                                         136\n\fBut we wanted to bring to the State‘s attention that there are prior\nconsistent statements which will be asked of Mr. Hayes. And we\nwanted to give the State -- tell them exactly what was going to be --\nwhat we anticipate the testimony is going to be.\n\nTHE COURT: How is the talking with the defendant not being\noffered by the defendant and therefore subject to hearsay rule?\n\nMR. WYATT: We‘re not asking about hearsay, Your Honor. We‘re\nasking about what happened. Not specifically about what exactly was\nsaid, but what exactly happened.\n\nWe don‘t believe it‘s hearsay. We don‘t believe it‘s hearsay because\nit‘s his statements about exactly what he was going through firsthand\nfrom the defendant, Your Honor. And under the rules, under\n801(d)1(B), when we look at -- sorry.

Those prongs --\nwould you like me to –\n\nTHE COURT: Are you referring to 801(e)1(B)?\nMR. WYATT: I‘m sorry, yes.\n\nTHE COURT: It‘s not the rule you cited.\n\nMR. WYATT: Yes, I cited the federal rule that they had in this case,\nYour Honor, so I was mistaken in that.\n\nThe four-prong test that they have is the declarant must testify at trial\nand be subject to cross-examination, as Mr. Davis has done.\n\nThere must be an expressed or implied charge of recent fabrication or\nimproper influential motive of the declarant‘s testimony by the\nopponent. That‘s been taken care of by cross-examination of Mr.\nDavis.\n\n                                  137\n\fThe proponent must offer a prior statement that is consistent with the\ndeclarant‘s challenged in-court testimony. That prong has also been\nadhered to or satisfied in this case.\n\nAnd No. 4, the prior consistent statement must be made prior to the\ntime that the supposed motive to falsify arose, which is the murder\ncharge.\n\nAll four prongs of that have been met, Your Honor, and we believe\nthat Franklin‘s prior consistent statements, since they have been put\ninto question by the prosecution, that they can absolutely come in at\nthis point in time that he did not have sex with Shania Gray.\n\nThat‘s been questioned by the State, asked by the Defense in the\nexhibits that have been put in, all the videotapes that have been put in.\nSo -- and the recordings by the State that Franklin Davis made. All\nthose things that have been put into evidence satisfy those four\nprongs. We believe that we can call witnesses to testify to prior\nconsistent statements of Mr. Davis in the guilt/innocent phase of the\ntrial.\n\nTHE COURT: Response from the State?\n\nMR. WILSON: The proffer fails to meet 801(e)1(B) specifically\nfailing to show that the statement was a recent fabrication. These\ndenials have been throughout, so there‘s no recent fabrication aspect\nto it, so therefore they failed to meet the evidentiary predicate. The\ntestimony should be excluded.\n\n[…]\n\nTHE COURT: Okay. You may call the witness. You will not be\nallowed to put on any consistent statements. It is not a recent\nfabrication or improper influence, as Mr. Wilson correctly argued, but\nyou may put the witness on for the other matters that you indicated.\nMake sure you instruct him not to go into any prior consistent\nstatements. You understand that?\n\n\n\n\n                                  138\n\f(RR65: 253–56, 258). Outside the presence of the jury, the defense called Hayes\n\nto make a record of the testimony that was being excluded. (RR65: 259–62).\n\nHayes testified that he met with the Appellant after the Appellant was accused of\n\nsexually assaulting Shania Gray. (RR65: 260). The Appellant had come to him for\n\ncounseling and spiritual guidance, and he denied the allegations. (RR65: 260–62).\n\nThe trial court and defense counsel instructed Hayes that he was not permitted to\n\ntestify that the Appellant denied the allegations. (RR65: 262). However, when\n\nHayes testified before the jury, he ignored those instructions:\n\n      MR. WYATT: When Frank came to see you, he came to see you\n      specifically about some issues he was having, correct?\n\n      HAYES: Yes, sir.\n\n      MR. WYATT: Okay. And those issues being the allegations that he\n      was facing concerning the allegations by Shania Gray of the sexual\n      assault, right?\n\n      HAYES: Yes, sir.\n\n      [...]\n      MR. WYATT: How was his demeanor when you took him into the\n      pastor‘s study?\n\n      HAYES: Well, he was -- he was -- he was very disturbed about the\n      situation and different things like that, and just wanted to speak with\n      us on it and -- and let us know, you know, that I – I’m innocent man.\n      I’m innocent.\n\n      THE COURT: Sir, I told you not to do that.\n\n      HAYES: Excuse me. Your Honor, okay.\n\n\n\n                                         139\n\f      THE COURT: Don't do it again.\n\n      HAYES: Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay.\n\n(RR65: 265, 267) (emphasis added).\n\n      Because Hayes testified to the exact statements the trial court excluded, the\n\nAppellant‘s complaint is moot. The jury was able to hear that the Appellant denied\n\nthe sexual assault allegations during his counseling with Hayes, and the trial court\n\ndid not instruct the jury to disregard the testimony. Accordingly, Appellant‘s Issue\n\n19 should be overruled.\n\n               Issues 20 and 21: Ashlye Sams and Lamar Leggiton\n\n      Prior to calling Ashlye Sams as a witness, the defense made a proffer of the\n\ntestimony they intended to elicit from her. (RR65: 280–83). Sams testified that she\n\nhad known Appellant for thirty years—her entire life. (RR65: 281). Sams also\n\ntestified that she learned that the Appellant had been accused of the sexual assault\n\nof a child, and had spoken with him about the charges on the phone sometime in\n\n2012. (RR65: 281). During the conversation, the Appellant denied the allegations\n\nand professed his innocence. (RR65: 281). The State objected to the proffered\n\ntestimony. (RR65: 283). The trial court sustained the objection. (RR65: 283).\n\n      The defense also proffered the testimony of Lamar Leggiton. Leggiton\n\ntestified that he and the Appellant had been best friends for twenty-five years.\n\n(RR65: 284). After Appellant was released from jail following his arrest for the\n\n\n\n                                         140\n\ffours charges of sexual assault, Leggiton was able to talk to the Appellant on the\n\nphone. (RR65: 284). Appellant told Leggiton that he had not sexually assaulted\n\nShania. (RR65: 285). The State objected to the proffered testimony, arguing that a\n\nproper predicate had not been established for admission under Rule 801(e)(1)(B) as\n\na prior consistent statement. (RR65: 286). The trial court sustained the objection.\n\n(RR65: 287).\n\n      The trial court properly sustained the State‘s objections to the proffered\n\ntestimony of Sams and Leggiton. Contrary to the Appellant‘s assertions, the\n\nAppellant failed to establish each of the four factors that predicate the admission of\n\na prior consistent statement under Rule 801(e)(1)(B). As discussed above, this\n\nCourt has recognized four requirements that must be met for prior consistent\n\nstatements to be admissible as nonhearsay. Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at\n\n804. Appellant has failed to satisfy two of the four requirements. First, Appellant\n\nfailed to show that there was an express or implied charge of recent fabrication or\n\nimproper influence or motive. Id. The record reflects that the Appellant had\n\nalways denied that he sexually assaulted Shania.        The State never made any\n\nsuggestion that the Appellant‘s denial had ever deviated or that he had altered his\n\ntestimony regarding the same. Rather, the State merely brought into question the\n\nAppellant‘s credibility, which does not equate to a charge of recent\n\nfabrication. See Tex. R. Evid. 611(b); Bosquez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (Tex.\n\n\n\n                                         141\n\fApp.—Fort Worth 2014, pet. ref‘d); Linney v.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. ref‘d).\n\n      Additionally, Appellant‘s statements to Sams and Leggiton did not come\n\nprior to the time that his motive to falsify arose. Hammons, 239 S.W.3d at 804.\n\nWhile Appellant argued at trial that his motive to lie arose when he was charged\n\nwith Shania‘s murder, in reality his motive to lie arose when he was indicted on\n\nfour counts of sexual assault of a child. While the Appellant‘s statements were\n\nmade prior to the murder, they occurred after the sexual assault charges. The\n\nsexual assault charges and the subsequent murder were intertwined. The State‘s\n\ntheory in this case was that the Appellant murdered Shania in order to prevent her\n\nfrom appearing as a witness against him in the upcoming sexual assault trial.\n\nAccordingly, his motive to lie arose at the time of the sexual assault charges.

Therefore, the exclusion of the complained-\n\nof testimony was a proper exercise of the trial court‘s discretion.

However, several days later on November 12, the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n      THE COURT: Any objections to the charge?\n\n      MR. PARKS: Let‘s hold off a minute. Let‘s talk about something.\n      THE COURT: There were no objections yesterday.\n      MR. PARKS: I understand. That‘s before I talked to my co-counsel,\n      and he insists that I request a charge on anti-speculation.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. What‘s the State‘s response to that?\n      MS. YEATTS: I‘m not clear the charge being requested, Judge.\n\n      MR. PARKS: The language would be a charge to the jury they must\n      render a verdict based solely on the evidence that they have heard and\n      not upon speculation.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. That request is denied. Anything else? Any\n      other objections?\n\n\n                                       143\n\f      MR.

(RR66: 19–20). While Appellant stated that he wanted the\n\ncourt to instruct the jury that ―they must render a verdict based solely on the\n\nevidence that they have heard and not upon speculation,‖ this was not sufficient to\n\nmeet the requirement of Article 36.15. (RR66: 19–20). Accordingly, the Appellant\n\nfailed to properly preserve his complaint for review.       Even if this issue was\n\npresented, it is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                         145\n\f      Appellant claims that the trial court should have included an instruction in\n\nthe charge similar to the one found in Thomas v.

State, No. 05-05-01379-CR, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2022404</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2006\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 6303, at *21 (Tex. App.—Dallas July 20, 2006, no pet.) (not\n\ndesignated for publication). In Thomas, the State attempted to admit ―documents\n\npurporting to be ‗certified copies of judgment[s] and sentences in prior cases‘‖ for\n\nthe defendant during the punishment phase of his trial. Id. at *20.               The\n\nprosecution‘s sponsoring witness, a clerk of the court, was unable to testify that the\n\ndefendant was the same person as the one named in the prior cases. Id. When the\n\nprosecution informed the court that they would need to call a fingerprint expert, the\n\ndefendant objected on the grounds that the prosecution had not disclosed such a\n\nwitness on their witness list. Id. The trial court sustained the objection and the\n\nevidence was not admitted. Id.\n\n      The defense then requested that the following instruction be included in the\n\ncharge: ―[T]he [S]tate attempted to offer certain documents into evidence that were\n\nnot admitted by the Court. You are instructed that you cannot consider these\n\ndocuments, nor speculate to what they might have contained whatsoever in\n\ndeliberating your punishment verdict.‖ Id. at *20–21. The trial court denied the\n\ninstruction, but instructed the jury as noted above and further included the jury that\n\n\n\n                                         146\n\fit could not consider evidence of any prior crimes or bad acts unless it found\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed the prior crimes. Id. at *21.\n\nAccordingly, the instruction in Thomas was proper because it was meant to address\n\na specific issue that arose during the trial.\n\n      Appellant, however, has failed to provide any authority in support of his\n\nclaim that he was entitled to such an instruction in this case or that the trial court\n\nerred by denying the request. While the Appellant is correct that the jury may not\n\nbase its verdict on mere speculation, juries are permitted to draw multiple\n\nreasonable inferences from the evidence. Hooper v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1404060\"><a href=\"/opinion/1404060/hooper-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007). The jury was properly instructed in this case. The following\n\ninstructions were included in the charge:\n\n      You are the exclusive judges of the facts proved, of the credibility of\n      the witnesses, and of the weight to be given to the testimony. But you\n      are bound to receive and to follow the law of the Court.\n\n      […]\n\n      The jury is only permitted to receive evidence regarding the case from\n      the witness stand. During your deliberations, you are not to consider,\n      refer to, or discuss any matters or issues not in evidence before you.\n\n      […]\n\n      Mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public\n      opinion, or public feeling is to play no part in your deliberations.\n\n(CR3: 168–69). Thus, the trial court properly instructed the jury not to consider\n\nanything outside of the evidence heard from the witness stand in reaching its\n\n                                           147\n\fverdict or base its verdict on conjecture. The trial court did not err in denying\n\nAppellant‘s request for an anti-speculation instruction.

Id.\n\n                                     Application\n\n      Appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the\n\nState‘s striking at him over defense counsel‘s shoulders and shifting the burden of\n\nproof during its closing argument in the guilt-innocence phase of his trial.\n\n\n\n                                          149\n\f      During closing argument in the guilt-innocence phase, defense counsel made\n\nthe following argument:\n\n      MR. HAYES: They have to prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt\n      that this murder was committed to prevent something from happening\n      in the future. And nothing has proven that [sic] you. There‘s been\n      nothing. Four days of testimony about it being premeditated, that\n      doesn‘t get them there. Four days of testimony that he was angry, that\n      doesn‘t get them there. Four days of testimony that she filed charges,\n      that doesn‘t get them there. Those retaliations, that doesn‘t get them\n      there.\n\n      In order to jump from first degree murder to capital murder, that very\n      specifically has to be proven. That‘s what we talked to each of you\n      about in voir dire, and that just didn‘t get them there.\n\n      All you see was a guy who lost everything, who behaved in a horrible,\n      horrible way and committed a horrible, horrible act.\n\n      Think about it. Did you hear a single thing where he said, ―I did it to\n      keep her from testifying‖?\n\n      We played everything. There‘s 14 hours of Frank talking. Did he ever\n      say that? There are even times when the detectives tried to get him to\n      mention it. Detective Williams, top-notch detective, she couldn't get\n      him to admit it. She tried to. She tried to pin him down. He said the\n      exact same thing he told everybody else, ―I told her how much she\n      fucked up my life.‖\n\n      Told her what she did in the past affected his life. He was at his\n      breaking point because she ruined his life. ―Fucked up everything. I\n      couldn‘t take care of my kids, my household. Had to get rid of my car.\n      I went from having diamond earrings and a nice job to being wiped\n      out completely.‖\n\n      Nothing about what was going to happen in the future. They tried to\n      get him to pin it down.\n\n\n\n\n                                       150\n\f      Keep in mind, never searched anything about that particular offense,\n      and he never talked to a lawyer. He didn‘t know what he was doing.\n      They tried to walk him around the best they could, and he didn't give\n      it to them. Do you know why? He lied a lot, but the thing he's being\n      consistent about is why. Why he did it.\n\n      And unless they prove something other than that, he‘s guilty of\n      murder. And he can still get up to a life sentence in murder. No one‘s\n      trying to say he‘s not guilty, no one, because he is. But the system\n      doesn‘t work unless you punish someone for what they did. The\n      system never works if you punish someone for what the State wants\n      you to do unless it‘s proven.\n\n(RR66: 45–46). Defense counsel further argued:\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: So when you go back there, if you can even get past\n      the fact that they didn‘t indict this case properly in the manner and\n      means, the drowning, which is -- look at the autopsy, that‘s that it\n      says. If you can get past that and you get to whether it‘s capital\n      murder or just murder, you‘ve got to come back with a verdict that is\n      just murder, because it‘s not obstruction. Because that‘s not -- he did\n      not kill her to prevent her from testifying, and that‘s what they have to\n      prove. They didn‘t do that. They didn‘t do that beyond a reasonable\n      doubt really.\n\n      Keep in mind, you come back with a verdict of murder, if you find it\n      appropriate, you can still sentence Frank to life in prison. But at least\n      do it for what the real charge is, what‘s really been proven to you.\n\n(RR66: 58). In rebuttal, the State made the following complained-of argument:\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: [H]e‘s the only person that said he didn‘t do it\n      because she was a witness or reported a crime. He‘s the only one that\n      says that.\n\n      It only comes from Frank. It only comes from Frank.\n\n      So what type of guy is Frank? He wants you to believe that he could\n      beat these charges. Frank, the one whose credibility you‘re supposed\n      to believe, the one who you‘re supposed to believe is a truth teller,\n\n                                        151\n\fFranklin tells you, ―I solved this case for Carrollton.‖ He walks in and\ntalks to Detective Chevallier and he says, ―Y‘all got it wrong. I‘m\ngoing to tell you what happened because I think I can beat this case.‖\nHe‘s telling you he can beat this capital murder case.\n\nWe spend two days talking about what we had, and the secret, the\nsecret is in his phone. I agree with Franklin Davis 100 percent when\nhe talks to Chevallier, ―technology is a mother-fucker.‖\n\nWhat do we get from the phone? What do we know before Franklin\never says he did anything? We know that his cell phone tower -- that\nhis cell phone, here in State‘s Exhibit Number 37, was bouncing off\nthe same tower as Shania Gray and Hebron High School. It was\nbouncing off the same tower as Sherry Gray and Hebron High School\nat the time that she went missing. It was bouncing off the towers the\nnight before when he wasn‘t supposed to be anywhere in Mesquite.\nWe know that not because Franklin told us, but because we solved\nthat case.\n\nDetective Williams solved that case. Andrew Hoog told us about\nthose fake text messages, the ones that he says so tearfully, ―You‘ve\ngot to believe me, I made these -- I didn‘t make these, Shania sent\nthem to me, and they're going to get me off.‖\n\nWe solved that, not him. We knew that Franklin had these audio\nrecordings because we had his phone. We knew that Franklin had this\nthrow-away phone saved in his contacts. We knew that not because he\ntold us, but because we investigated that case.\n\nWe knew that Shania died by asphyxiation and by gunshot wounds\nnot because he told us, but because we did the autopsy in this case.\nWe didn't need Franklin to tell you he did it. We knew he did it before\nhe walked into that interrogation room.\n\nHe wants you to give him credit and find him guilty of the lesser\nincluded offense of murder. They keep bringing up the punishment\nrange. They want you to think about the punishment range. Make\nyou feel better about doing something that’s not supported by what\nFranklin says.\n\n\n                                  152\n\f      MR. HAYES: Judge, now I have to object. I think that‘s improperly\n      striking at the defendant over counsel‘s shoulder and it shifts the\n      burden.\n\n      THE COURT: Fair reply. Overruled. Ten minutes.\n\n      MR. BIRMINGHAM: That‘s why they do that. They want you to\n      look everywhere but what happened on the shores of the Trinity\n      River.\n\n(RR66: 66–69) (emphasis added).\n\n      Appellant argues that the comment referring to defense counsel‘s attempt to\n\ndirect the jury away from the guilt-innocence stage of the trial suggested that\n\ndefense counsel were misleading the jury, bringing their credibility and veracity\n\nwith the jury into question. Appellant summarily argues that the comments were\n\nmanifestly improper, harmful, and prejudicial.\n\n      The trial court properly overruled the Appellant‘s objection because the\n\nargument was made in response to the argument made by defense counsel. The\n\nprosecutor‘s comments were not a personal attack on defense counsel; rather, they\n\nwere made in answer to counsel‘s argument that the jury should accept the\n\nAppellant‘s assertions that he killed Shania because she had ruined his life and not\n\nto prevent her from testifying against him, and therefore, he was guilty only of\n\nmurder. On two occasions during the defense team‘s closing argument counsel\n\nmentioned that the jury could find the Appellant guilty of murder, the lesser\n\noffense, and still sentence the Appellant to life in prison.\n\n\n\n                                          153\n\f      It is clear from the context of the argument that the prosecutor‘s statement\n\nwas not directed at defense counsel personally, but was an attack on the argument\n\nmade by defense counsel. Such an argument was permissible and appropriate.

(concluding that prosecutor‘s argument that the jury should ―not to\n\nbe fooled‖ by evidence presented by the defense, which was ―good lawyering,‖\n\nwas proper in response to the argument made by defense counsel). Consequently,\n\nthe trial court did not err by overruling the Appellant‘s objection to this argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                         154\n\f                            Error, if any, was Harmless\n\n      Further, even if this Court were to find that the State‘s argument was\n\nimproper, any error was harmless. Improper argument is non-constitutional error,\n\nand non-constitutional error that does not affect a defendant‘s substantial rights\n\nmust be disregarded. Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). To\n\ndetermine whether an appellant‘s substantial rights were affected, an appellate\n\ncourt balances three factors: (1) the severity of the misconduct (i.e., the prejudicial\n\neffect), (2) any curative measures, and (3) the certainty of conviction absent the\n\nmisconduct. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572–73. In evaluating the severity of the\n\nmisconduct, the reviewing court must assess whether the argument injected new\n\nand harmful facts or was, in light of the entire argument, extreme or manifestly\n\nunjust and willfully calculated to deprive appellant of a fair and impartial trial. Id.\n\nat 573.\n\n      Viewing the State‘s closing argument as a whole, the record does not\n\ndemonstrate that there was a willful, calculated effort to deprive the Appellant of a\n\nfair and impartial trial. The prosecutor‘s argument was made in response to the\n\nargument made by defense counsel that the jury could still sentence the Appellant\n\nto life in prison if they found him guilty of murder rather than capital murder. It is\n\nclear from the context of the argument that the prosecutor did not have an improper\n\n\n\n\n                                         155\n\fmotive and the complained-of statements were only a small portion of the whole\n\nargument.\n\n      Finally, the evidence of Appellant‘s guilt was overwhelming. The Appellant\n\ntestified that he murdered Shania. The only disputed issue was whether Appellant\n\nhad done so in order to prevent her from testifying against him in the upcoming\n\nsexual assault trial. While Appellant vehemently denied this and instead argued\n\nthat he killed her because she had ruined his life, there was considerable evidence\n\nthat proved the Appellant killed Shania to prevent her from testifying.\n\n      The State presented evidence of the Appellant‘s elaborate plan to manipulate\n\nShania using a false identity. The evidence showed that Appellant pretended to be\n\na young man named ―D‖ who was interested in getting to know Shania. The\n\nAppellant called Shania using this false identity and recorded their conversations.\n\nIn the conversations, the Appellant manipulated Shania into talking about the\n\nsexual assault allegations and about her sexual history, hoping to get Shania to\n\nmake statements that he could use to attack her credibility at the trial.\n\n      He also attempted to dissuade her from testifying by suggesting that she\n\ncould go to jail if she was caught lying and by telling her that the man she was\n\ntestifying against might hold a grudge against her and come after her when he got\n\nout of jail. When this tactic ultimately failed, the Appellant created a series of fake\n\ntext messages, which he intended to use as evidence at the trial. The six messages,\n\n\n\n                                          156\n\fall appearing to be from Shania, contained her alleged recantation of the sexual\n\nassault allegations.\n\n      The Appellant then used the false identity to lure Shania into a meeting,\n\nduring which he drove her to a secluded portion of the Trinity River, forced her to\n\nwalk down an embankment to the river, and shot her in the back. When she fell\n\ninto the water, the Appellant shot her again in the neck. He then pulled her out of\n\nthe water, laid her on the ground, and placed his foot on her throat until she\n\nstopped breathing. After rolling her body into the river, he left the scene to dispose\n\nof the gun and other evidence. When questioned by the police about Shania‘s\n\ndisappearance, the Appellant denied any involvement, and continued to maintain\n\nthat he was innocent of the sexual assault charges. The Appellant relied on the\n\nfake text messages as evidence that he was innocent of the sexual assaults and also\n\nas evidence that he would have had no reason to harm Shania now that she had\n\nrecanted.\n\n      Based on this evidence, the jury most certainly would have convicted\n\nAppellant regardless of the prosecutor‘s statements. Thus, any error in the\n\nprosecutor‘s argument did not affect appellant‘s substantial rights. See Brown, 270\n\nS.W.3d at 572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). Accordingly, Issue 23 is without merit\n\nand should be overruled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         157\n\f   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUE 24: THE EVIDENCE IS LEGALLY SUFFICIENT TO\n              SUPPORT THE JURY’S ANSWER TO SPECIAL ISSUE 1.\n\n      In Issue 24, the Appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury‘s answer to Special Issue No. 1, the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. Specifically, the Appellant asserts that he had no prior violent offense\n\nconvictions and defense witnesses testified that he was essentially a low risk for\n\nfuture dangerousness. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 113–16). Appellant‘s contentions\n\nare without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The State has the burden of proving the punishment issue of future\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071,\n\n§§ 2(b)(1), 2(c) (West Supp. 2014). In assessing the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence of future dangerousness, this Court views the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that the appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. See Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 284.\n\n      In its determination of the special issues, the jury is entitled to consider all\n\nthe evidence presented at the guilt phase of the trial, in addition to the evidence\n\npresented at the punishment phase. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863. Some factors the\n\njury may consider when determining whether appellant will pose a continuing\n\n                                         158\n\fthreat to society include: (1) the circumstances of the offense, including the\n\ndefendant‘s state of mind and whether he was working alone or with other parties;\n\n(2) the calculated nature of his acts; (3) the forethought and deliberateness\n\nexhibited by the crime‘s execution; (4) the existence of a prior criminal record and\n\nthe severity of the prior crimes; (5) the defendant‘s age and personal circumstances\n\nat the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was acting under duress or the\n\ndomination of another at the time of the offense; (7) psychiatric evidence; and (8)\n\ncharacter evidence.

The\n\ncircumstances of the offense and the events surrounding it may be sufficient in\n\nsome instances to sustain a ―yes‖ answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.\n\nYoung, 283 S.W.3d at 863.\n\n                                    Application\n\n      The evidence from both phases of the trial unquestionably demonstrates\n\nAppellant‘s future dangerousness. First, the facts of the offense, standing alone,\n\nare sufficient to support the jury‘s finding. The evidence showed that in April\n\n2011 Shania made an outcry of sexual assault, telling her mother that the Appellant\n\nhad assaulted her while she was babysitting his daughter and two other children.\n\nAs a result of that admission, the Appellant was indicted on four counts of sexual\n\n\n\n\n                                        159\n\fassault of a child in August 2011. One year later, the Appellant was notified that\n\nthe trial on the charges was set for October 29, 2012.\n\n      With only a few months until the trial, the Appellant began an elaborate plan\n\nto manipulate Shania into dropping the charges against him. First, the Appellant\n\ncreated a false identity. The Appellant found a Facebook profile for a young man\n\nthat he believed Shania would find attractive, Artis Powell.        The Appellant\n\ncontacted Shania and told her that he had seen her Facebook profile and wanted to\n\nget to know her. The Appellant told Shania that he was Powell, but went by the\n\nnickname ―D‖ because his middle name was Dwayne. The Appellant then used a\n\n―throwaway phone‖ he purchased at Walmart to call Shania while pretending to be\n\n―D.‖ The Appellant recorded the conversations with Shania on his T-Mobile smart\n\nphone.\n\n      In the conversations, the Appellant attempted to elicit statements he could\n\nuse against her at the sexual assault trial. He manipulated her into talking to him\n\nabout the sexual assaults, trying to get her to make statements that were\n\ninconsistent with what she told the police. The Appellant also asked Shania about\n\nher past sexual relationships, looking for information he could use to disparage her\n\ncharacter. He attempted to dissuade her from testifying by suggesting that she\n\ncould go to prison if she was caught lying. He also told her that the man she was\n\ntestifying against might hold a grudge against her if he went to prison and might\n\n\n\n                                         160\n\fcome after her when he was released. The Appellant also suggested that she go to\n\nthe police and tell them that she lied, so the charges would be dropped. He assured\n\nher that the police would not do anything to her because she was a minor. Despite\n\nthe Appellant‘s repeated manipulations, Shania did not recant the allegations or\n\nrequest to drop the charges.\n\n      When this tactic failed, the Appellant murdered Shania. Realizing that\n\nShania had a ―crush‖ on ―D,‖ the Appellant lured her into meeting him after\n\nschool. The Appellant drove Shania to a secluded area at Sam Houston Trail Park\n\nand forced her to walk down an embankment to the Trinity River. The Appellant\n\nthen shot her in the back. When she fell into the water, the Appellant shot her a\n\nsecond time in the neck. When the Appellant realized she was not dead, he pulled\n\nher out of the water, laid her on the ground, and placed his foot on her throat until\n\nshe stopped breathing. The Appellant then rolled her body into the river and left\n\nthe scene to dispose of the gun and other evidence.\n\n      The Appellant also created a series of fake text messages that he intended to\n\nuse as evidence at the sexual assault trial.       The messages, made using an\n\napplication he installed on his smart phone, appeared to be from Shania and\n\ncontained a recantation of the sexual assault allegations. When first questioned by\n\nthe police, the Appellant denied any involvement in Shania‘s disappearance and\n\nalso claimed that he had text messages that proved he was innocent of the sexual\n\n\n\n                                        161\n\fassault charges. Even after he ultimately confessed to the murder, the Appellant\n\ncontinued to tell the detectives and the media about the text messages, never\n\nadmitting to anyone that they were fake.\n\n      The calculated and deliberate nature of the Appellant‘s actions in\n\ncommitting this violent and heinous murder was sufficient to support the jury‘s\n\nfinding of future dangerousness. See Druery v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769103\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769103/druery-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 507 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007) (the circumstances of an offense can be some of the most\n\nrevealing evidence of future dangerousness and may be sufficient to independently\n\nsupport an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness issue).\n\n      The State, however, did not rely solely on the facts of the offense to prove\n\nthe Appellant‘s future dangerousness. During the punishment phase of his trial,\n\nthe jury also heard about the Appellant‘s escape from Parkland Hospital while in\n\npolice custody awaiting trial for capital murder.\n\n      Dallas County Sheriff‘s Deputy Steven Underwood was assigned to guard\n\nthe Appellant on the evening of December 4, 2012. (RR66: 147). The Appellant\n\nhad been admitted to Parkland Hospital on December 1, 2012 after complaining\n\nthat he was dizzy. (RR68: 68). This was the Appellant‘s sixth trip to Parkland\n\nsince his arrest. (RR68: 67–68). Underwood testified that the Appellant was due to\n\nbe discharged at 9:30pm. (RR66: 147). At approximately 8:00pm, shortly after\n\nUnderwood returned from a break, the Appellant asked Underwood if he could\n\n\n\n                                         162\n\ftake a shower before going back to jail. (RR65: 147). Underwood agreed and\n\ndecided to remove the Appellant‘s leg restraints and handcuffs. (RR66: 148).\n\n        Once the leg restraints were removed, the Appellant sat up on the side of the\n\nbed and faced Underwood. (RR66: 148). When the handcuffs were also removed,\n\nthe Appellant said: ―I‘m sorry, man,‖ and grabbed Underwood by his gun holster\n\nand vest and backed him into the wall. (RR66: 148–50). Underwood testified that\n\nthe Appellant had some type of sharp object in his left hand and told him that he\n\nwould cut him if he moved. (RR66: 150–51). Underwood testified that he grabbed\n\nthe Appellant and backed him into the left corner of the room. (RR66: 151). The\n\ntwo wrestled around and the Appellant reached for Underwood‘s gun. (RR66:\n\n151).\n\n        Underwood tried to knock the Appellant to the ground but was unable to;\n\ninstead, the Appellant landed on a nightstand. (RR66: 151–52). The two continued\n\nto wrestle, and then Underwood heard a ―pop.‖ (RR66: 152). Underwood‘s holster\n\nhad broken and the Appellant had his gun. (RR66: 152). Underwood testified that\n\nhe focused on holding onto the gun and keeping it pointed away from him during\n\nthe struggle. (RR66: 152–53). However, the Appellant was able to free himself\n\nfrom Underwood and pointed the gun at him. (RR66: 153–54). The gun was a\n\nfully loaded 40-caliber Glock 22. (RR66: 167, 170). Underwood put his hands in\n\nthe air and complied with the Appellant‘s commands to get on the ground. (RR66:\n\n\n\n                                         163\n\f155–56). The Appellant then fled the room. (RR66: 157). Later that night, Dallas\n\nSWAT was able to locate the Appellant a few blocks away from Parkland Hospital\n\nin a red Austin‘s Barbeque van parked between two buildings. (RR67: 54, 57–61;\n\nSX: 292–95). Approximately twenty to twenty-five SWAT officers responded to\n\nthe location. (RR67: 55). After an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the\n\nSWAT team, the Appellant surrendered. (RR67: 61).\n\n      The State also presented evidence of the Appellant‘s history of emotionally\n\nand physically abusing the women in his life. The Appellant testified on cross-\n\nexamination that he had five children. (RR65: 182).           However, he also\n\nacknowledged that could have as many as eleven children. (RR65: 182–83). Four\n\nof the mothers of his children testified at his trial concerning the abuse they\n\nsuffered during their relationships.\n\n      Linda Crawford, the mother of the Appellant‘s twelve year-old son Trey,\n\ntestified about multiple incidents in which the Appellant was physically violent\n\nwith her. (RR66: 80). Linda met the Appellant in 2000 when she was sixteen and\n\nthe Appellant was eighteen. (RR66: 80–81). Linda became pregnant with Trey a\n\nfew months after the two began dating. (RR66: 83). The first incident in which the\n\nAppellant became violent with her occurred when she was seven or eight months\n\npregnant with Trey. (RR66: 85). Linda surprised the Appellant at his apartment\n\nand found him with another woman. (RR66: 85, 101). Linda tried to push her way\n\n\n\n                                       164\n\finto the apartment, but the Appellant came outside, pushed her and told her to ―get\n\ngoing and don‘t come around here.‖ (RR66: 86, 103–04). He grabbed her by the\n\nthroat and held her against the building, again telling her to leave. (RR66: 86). He\n\npushed her and shoved her away from the apartment, all the way to a nearby\n\nconvenience store. (RR66: 86).\n\n      Linda testified that sometime in 2001, after Trey was born, the Appellant\n\ncalled her to come over to his apartment so that they could be ―intimate.‖ (RR66:\n\n87). While she was at his apartment, Labrena, the mother of Appellant‘s other son,\n\nreturned home and wanted to know why Linda was there. (RR66: 87–88, 106).\n\nThe Appellant pretended not to know, and feeling embarrassed, Linda began to\n\nargue with him. (RR66: 88). At one point, Linda threw a baby‘s milk bottle at the\n\nAppellant, hitting him in the face. (RR66: 116). The Appellant picked up the\n\nbottle and poured the milk over her head. (RR66: 116, 118–19).\n\n      As Linda was leaving, the Appellant swung a clothes hanger at her and hit\n\nher on her arm. (RR66: 88). Linda was holding Trey, who was a few months old at\n\nthe time, and had to ―let him go‖ in order to defend herself. (RR66: 88). She was\n\nable to catch Trey before he hit the ground, but she ended up with a cut on her arm\n\nfrom the clothes hanger. (RR66: 88). Following this incident, Linda‘s father called\n\nthe police and Appellant was arrested for assault. (RR66: 88).\n\n\n\n\n                                        165\n\f      Linda testified that she knew the Appellant had multiple other children.\n\n(RR66: 89). He had a thirteen year-old daughter named Kurstyne with Latrice\n\nBrown, a twelve year-old son named Ahmad with Labrena Henderson, and another\n\nson named TK with a woman named Nicole. (RR66: 89–90).          Linda did not learn\n\nthat TK was the Appellant‘s son until he was arrested in this case, despite the fact\n\nthat TK and his mother lived in her apartment complex and her son played with\n\nTK. (RR66: 90).\n\n      Labrena Henderson, the mother of the Appellant‘s son Ahmad, testified that\n\nshe met the Appellant in 1999 while working at a McDonalds in Texarkana.\n\n(RR66: 122–23). The two began a romantic relationship and Linda gave birth to\n\nAhmad Davis on September 24, 2001. (RR66: 124). Labrena testified that the\n\nAppellant, who was living with her at that time, would leave at night and not come\n\nback for days at a time. (RR66: 127). When he returned, she would ask him where\n\nhe had been and he would get upset. (RR66: 128). On one occasion, he pushed her\n\nagainst the wall. (RR66: 127–28). Labrena immediately left and went to her\n\nmother‘s house. (RR66: 128).\n\n      Jennifer Dibrell, the mother of the Appellant‘s daughter Dezire, testified\n\nabout several incidents of violence involving the Appellant. (RR67: 73–74). When\n\nJennifer was pregnant with Dezire, she and the Appellant got into an altercation\n\nwhen she found out that the Appellant was with another woman rather than at his\n\n\n\n                                        166\n\fsister‘s house. (RR67: 75). During that altercation, the Appellant grabbed her, and\n\npinned her by her arms so that she could not move, and whispered in her ear: ―I\n\nhope you lose your baby.‖ (RR67: 75).\n\n      On another occasion, after Dezire was born, the Appellant pulled a knife on\n\nher during an argument. (RR67: 77). Dezire was present and saw the entire\n\nincident. (RR67: 78). Jennifer grabbed Dezire and held her so that the Appellant\n\nwould not hurt either of them. (RR67: 77–78). On another occasion, the Appellant\n\nshot her in the leg with a BB gun during an argument. (RR67: 78). Finally,\n\nJennifer testified that the Appellant forced her to have anal sex after one of their\n\narguments. (RR67: 79–80). Jennifer testified that she felt that the Appellant was\n\nmanipulative. (RR67: 80–81). When she caught him in a lie, he would act like she\n\nwas crazy and tried to make other people think she was crazy too. (RR67: 80–81).\n\n      The Appellant was also violent with his wife Jawanna Arrington. Jawanna\n\nand the Appellant became engaged in August 2010 and married in June 2011.\n\n(RR66: 201–02). Jawanna testified that the Appellant ―put his hands on her‖ on\n\nseveral occasions. (RR66: 202). He choked her, threatened her with knives, and on\n\ntwo occasions, put a gun to her head. (RR66: 202, 209–10). Jawanna testified that\n\nthe violent incidents would begin with an argument, and when she responded to his\n\nanger with silence, he would grab her around the neck with both hands and choke\n\n\n\n\n                                        167\n\fher. (RR66: 202–03). Jawanna testified that this happened more than twenty times\n\nover the course of their relationship. (RR66: 204).\n\n      Jawanna testified that they would argue about everything from the Appellant\n\nhaving a bad day to her catching him texting other women. (RR66: 205). On one\n\noccasion when they were arguing over her cell phone, the Appellant forced\n\nJawanna to the floor against the fireplace. (RR66: 204). She ended up with bruises\n\nand scratches on her back from the bricks on the fireplace. (RR66: 204). Jawanna\n\ndid not call the police because she loved the Appellant and did not want him to get\n\nin trouble, nor did she want her family to find out about the abuse. (RR66: 203).\n\n      Finally, the State offered certified copies of the Appellant‘s four prior\n\nconvictions for: (1) burglary of a motor vehicle in 2001; (2) evading arrest in 2001;\n\n(3) failure to identify in 2001; and (4) fleeing or attempting to elude a police\n\nofficer in 2007. (RR66: 138–142; SX: 244–48).\n\n      Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence based on the lack of\n\nprior convictions for violent offenses and because defense witnesses testified that\n\nhe was a low risk for future dangerousness. The Appellant‘s argument, however,\n\nfails to consider the substantial evidence of violence in his relationships. The\n\nevidence showed that the Appellant would lie and manipulate to get what he\n\nwanted. Over the course of five years he had five children with five different\n\nwomen. In fact, Linda, the mother of his son Trey, did not find out that TK was\n\n\n\n                                        168\n\fthe Appellant‘s son until this trial, even though he lived in the same apartment\n\ncomplex with her and played with her son. The Appellant was able to convince\n\nmultiple women to continue their sexual relationships with him after he had left\n\nthem for another woman. The evidence showed that the Appellant responded with\n\nviolence when any of the women he was in a relationship with attempted to\n\nquestion or challenge him about his infidelity. The Appellant was manipulative\n\nand violent with men as well. He was able to get Deputy Underwood to remove\n\nhis restraints under the pretense of taking a shower, then used that opportunity to\n\noverpower Underwood, steal his gun, and escape.\n\n      Viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, there is sufficient evidence\n\nfor a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that\n\nthe Appellant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society. Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support\n\nthe jury‘s answer to the future dangerousness special issue, and Issue 24 should be\n\noverruled.\n\n   STATE’S RESPONSE TO ISSUES 25-35: THE TRIAL COURT PROPERLY DENIED\n     APPELLANT’S REQUESTED JURY INSTRUCTIONS AND OVERRULED HIS\n                      OBJECTIONS TO THE CHARGE.\n\n      In Issues 25 through 35, Appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\ndenying his requested instructions and overruling his objections to the court‘s\n\n\n\n\n                                         169\n\fpunishment charge. (Appellant‘s Brief at pp. 117–41).               The Appellant‘s\n\ncontentions lack merit and should be overruled.\n\n      On November 12, 2013, the Appellant filed a motion entitled ―Defendant‘s\n\nObjections to the Charge at Punishment.‖ (CR3: 174–89). In that motion, the\n\nAppellant raised 55 objections to the trial court‘s punishment charge. (CR3: 174–\n\n89). The Appellant‘s objections were overruled. (RR68: 130).\n\n      In Issue 25, the Appellant recites verbatim the paragraphs titled ―Objections\n\nto Language in the Body of the Instructions‖ from his ―Defendant‘s Objections to\n\nthe Charge at Punishment.‖ (CR3: 174–80). In Issues 26 through 35, the Appellant\n\nrecites verbatim the paragraphs titled ―Defendant‘s Objections to the Verdict\n\nForms‖ from his ―Defendant‘s Objections to the Charge at Punishment.‖ (CR3:\n\n174–88).\n\n      In his briefing on appeal, the Appellant asserts no additional analysis and\n\nprovides no law other than that presented to the trial court. He concedes that\n\nsimilar claims have been previously rejected by this Court. Appellant indicates\n\nthese issues are included in his direct appeal brief in order to preserve them for\n\nsubsequent review by the federal courts. Although he asks this Court to reconsider\n\nits prior rulings, he does nothing to persuade the Court that its prior decisions were\n\nincorrect.\n\n\n\n\n                                         170\n\f       To the extent that the State is able to discern the Appellant‘s objections or\n\nrequested instruction, the State agrees that with Appellant his claims are foreclosed\n\nby well-settled law. (See Appellant‘s Brief at p. 117). Where possible, the State\n\nhas attempted to address the Appellant‘s claims or has attempted to provide the\n\nCourt with a citation to the applicable statute or to authority wherein the same or\n\nsimilar issue, instruction, or objection has been addressed and rejected.\n\n                    Issue 25: Objections to the Punishment Charge\n\n                                           Issue 25\n\n        25(1): The trial court‘s punishment charge does not contain the\n         complained-of language: ―In order for the Court to assess proper\n         punishment ….‖ (CR3: 190–97).\n\n        25(2): The trial court‘s punishment charge does not contain language\n         ―instructing each juror as if it [sic] he/she were one decision making\n         body.‖ (CR3: 190–97).\n\n        25(3): Appellant objects to particular language used in the charge\n         pertaining to answering the special issues, including the use of\n         ―determine,‖ ―shall answer,‖ or ―arriving at the answers to.‖ (CR3: 175).\n         The court‘s charge only utilized the phrase ―shall answer‖ in one\n         instance—in Appellant‘s favor.13 Generally regarding the jury‘s answers\n         to the special issues, the trial court used a combination of ―duty to\n         determine,‖ ―in deliberating on,‖ ―shall next consider,‖ ―in arriving at,‖\n         and ―in determining your answers.‖ (CR3: 190–95). Appellant presents\n         no support, either at trial or on appeal, for the contention that use of this\n         language was erroneous or violated his constitutional rights.\n\n\n13\n  Regarding special issue number one, the charge instructed the jurors that if they did not find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the answer to the first special issue (regarding future\ndangerousness) should be yes or if they had a reasonable doubt as to the answer, then they ―shall\nanswer‖ the special issue ―no.‖ (CR3: 191).\n\n\n                                              171\n\f 25(4): The punishment charge did not utilize the term ―mandatory\n  punishment.‖\n\n 25(5): Mays v.

Such an\n  instruction, for the jury to prioritize one instruction and disregard\n  another, would be wholly improper, and the State asks this Court to reject\n  this complaint.\n\n 25(7): Estrada, 313 S.W.3d at 306–07; Gardner v.
