JONES, Circuit Judge:\n\n      A    manufacturer   and   distributor    of    over-the-counter          dietary\nsupplements, Isodrene and The HCG Solution, appeals the district court’s\norder dismissing its constitutional and state law claims against the Attorney\nGeneral of the State of Texas on the sole basis of state sovereign immunity.\nWe conclude that it is at least partially correct that NiGen’s claims are not\nbarred from federal jurisdiction on the basis of Ex parte Young; federal\njurisdiction plainly exists over most of the constitutional claims pled; and\n\f    Case: 14-10923      Document: 00513213635       Page: 2     Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10923\nNiGen has standing to sue.       Accordingly, we affirm in part, and vacate and\nremand in part for further proceedings.\n                                 BACKGROUND\n      NiGen makes and sells dietary supplements, two of which contain the\n“individual amino acid building blocks” of prescription-drug ingredient hCG. 1\nThe company labels the packages of these products with the term “hCG,” which\nthe Attorney General of the State of Texas (the “AG” or the State) determined\nwas “false, misleading, or deceptive” in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act (“DTPA”) because, among other reasons, “the claim is trying to\nmimic claims that FDA considers off-label for the prescription drug.”               In\nOctober 2011, the AG sent letters to this effect to NiGen and its retailers,\nincluding CVS, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart, intimating that formal enforcement\nwas on the horizon for both NiGen and the retailers.          The retailers pulled the\nproducts from their shelves in Texas and other states, allegedly costing NiGen\nmillions of dollars in lost revenue.\n      NiGen filed suit in December 2011 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nviolations of its rights under the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment\nDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses, the Commerce Clause, and the\nSupremacy Clause.       The company also alleged a state law claim of tortious\ninterference with existing business relations. NiGen sought 1) a declaration\nthat its labeling did not violate federal law and that it was entitled to use\n“HCG” on its labels; 2) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief; 3) money\ndamages; and 4) costs and attorneys’ fees.\n\n      1  hCG is an acronym for human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, a protein found in\npregnant women that is an ingredient in prescription drugs sold under the brand names\nNovarel, Ovidrel, and Pregnyl.\n\n                                          2\n\f    Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635      Page: 3   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                             No. 14-10923\n      The AG moved for dismissal, alleging both jurisdictional and pleading\ndefects.   As for the jurisdictional claims, the AG argued that the plaintiff\nlacked Article III standing because the only injury to NiGen was the result of\nthird-party action; that the “federal statutory claim” was non-justiciable\nbecause NiGen asked for a declaration that its labeling did not violate FDA\nlaw, though the AG was never attempting to enforce federal law; and that state\nsovereign immunity barred the money damages and state law claims.             The\nAG alternatively averred that NiGen’s claims fail to state a claim as required\nby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).    Substantial briefing and pretrial\nmotions preceded the submission of these motions to the court in July 2012.\n      For reasons not apparent in the record, the district court did not rule for\nalmost two years.    Then, despite the plethora of jurisdictional issues before it,\nthe court dismissed the entire case as barred by state sovereign immunity.\nNiGen seasonably appealed.\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      We review the trial court’s jurisdictional determinations de novo.\nFontenot v. McCraw, 777 F.3d 741, 746 (5th Cir. 2015).          “The question of\nwhether state defendants are entitled to sovereign immunity is likewise\nreviewed de novo.”     Moore v. La. Bd. of Elementary & Secondary Educ.,\n743 F.3d 959, 962 (5th Cir. 2014); see also Hale v. King, 642 F.3d 492, 497 (5th\nCir. 2011) (per curiam).     We review the court’s rulings on Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotions de novo and must determine whether the pleaded facts state plausible\nclaims that are cognizable in law.    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n570, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1974 (2007).     Federal courts may analyze arguments\nthat question our jurisdiction in any order.    In this unusual situation, all of\n\n\n                                         3\n\f     Case: 14-10923       Document: 00513213635         Page: 4     Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                               No. 14-10923\nthe jurisdictional arguments must be addressed for NiGen’s suit to proceed in\nfederal court.\n                                     DISCUSSION\n       The district court concluded that state sovereign immunity barred\nNiGen’s entire suit and therefore pretermitted analysis of the AG’s other\narguments. The district court cited Aguilar v. Texas Department of Criminal\nJustice for the broad proposition that “a suit against state officials that is in\nfact a suit against a State is barred regardless of whether it seeks damages or\ninjunctive relief.”    160 F.3d 1052, 1053 (5th Cir. 1998) (quoting Pennhurst\nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 102, 104 S. Ct. 900, 909 (1984)).\nThis is deficient not least because shortly thereafter the opinion acknowledges\nthe availability of Ex parte Young suits to enforce federal law. 2 Rather than\nfully defend the district court’s reasoning, the AG resurrects its original\narguments against federal jurisdiction and raises new ones.\n   A. State Sovereign Immunity\n       The several states of our union retained those aspects of sovereignty that\nthe people did not explicitly assign to the federal government. 3                 Since the\njudicial article does not “create new and unheard of remedies,” Hans v.\nLouisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 12, 10 S. Ct. 504, 506 (1890), the sovereign states cannot\nbe sued without their consent.           See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 276,\n106 S. Ct. 2932, 2939 (1986).           As a result, “Federal courts are without\n\n\n       2  Moreover, Aguilar itself was filed not against an individual state officer acting in\nhis official capacity, but against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, a state agency\nthat shares the sovereign immunity of the State of Texas.\n\n       3  Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 713, 119 S. Ct. 2240, 2246-47 (1999); see also In re\nNew York, 256 U.S. 490, 497, 41 S. Ct. 588, 589 (1921) (discussing state sovereign immunity\nas “the fundamental rule of which the amendment is but an exemplification”).\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 14-10923       Document: 00513213635          Page: 5     Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10923\njurisdiction over suits against a state, a state agency, or a state official in his\nofficial capacity unless that state has waived its sovereign immunity or\nCongress has clearly abrogated it.” Moore, 743 F.3d at 963.                   Texas has not\nconsented by statute, and § 1983 does not abrogate state sovereign immunity.\nQuern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 340, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 1145 (1979).\n       “A suit is not ‘against’ a state, however, when it seeks prospective,\ninjunctive relief from a state actor . . . based on an alleged ongoing violation of\nthe federal constitution.”       K.P. v. LeBlanc, 729 F.3d 427, 439 (5th Cir. 2013).\nUnder the doctrine articulated in Ex parte Young, 4 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441\n(1908), a state official attempting to enforce an unconstitutional law “is\nstripped of his official clothing and becomes a private person subject to suit.”\nK.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 F.3d 115, 124 (5th Cir. 2010).             “Suits by private citizens\nagainst state officers in their official capacit[ies] are not, therefore,\ncategorically barred.” Fontenot, 777 F.3d at 752.               NiGen sued the Attorney\nGeneral in his official capacity, satisfying the first requirement of Ex parte\nYoung.\n       Certain of NiGen’s claims fail, however, to the extent they request\nretrospective money damages.           A claim for money damages “seek[s] to impose\na liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury.”\nEdelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 663, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 1356 (1974).                 As the AG\ncorrectly points out, the Eleventh Amendment bars federal court jurisdiction\nover such claims.\n\n\n\n\n       4 Although the doctrine is universally associated with Ex parte Young, the central\nconceit can be traced further back. See, e.g., United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196, 197, 1 S. Ct.\n240, 241 (1882).\n                                               5\n\f     Case: 14-10923       Document: 00513213635         Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-10923\n          Further, NiGen’s state law claim for tortious interference with contract\nfails to establish federal jurisdiction because the Ex parte Young doctrine only\nreaches alleged violations of federal law.          McKinley v. Abbott, 643 F.3d 403,\n406 (5th Cir. 2011); see also Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp., 465 U.S. at 106,\n104 S. Ct. at 911.\n          A final prerequisite of Ex parte Young is that “the relief sought must be\ndeclaratory or injunctive in nature and prospective in effect.”              Saltz v. Tenn.\nDep’t of Emp’t Sec., 976 F.2d 966, 968 (5th Cir. 1992).              Notably, in the trial\ncourt, the AG did not move to dismiss NiGen’s federal claims for declaratory\nand injunctive relief on the grounds that they failed to request prospective\nrelief.       Now, on appeal, the AG argues for the first time that even the\ninjunctive and declaratory claims are ineligible for Ex parte Young because the\nplaintiff does not allege an “ongoing violation of federal law.”           It is true that a\ncomplaint must allege that the defendant is violating federal law, not simply\nthat the defendant has done so. 5 See Green v. Mansour, 474 U.S. 64, 71-73,\n106 S. Ct. 423, 427-29 (1985).       The State argues that whatever “smattering of\npresent tense language” is in the complaint does not suffice to allege an ongoing\nviolation of federal law. Assuming arguendo that the AG has not waived this\nargument by failing to raise it in the district court, 6 we are unpersuaded, for\nthe Supreme Court has explained that courts generally conduct a\n“straightforward inquiry into whether [the] complaint alleges an ongoing\n\n\n         This requirement is similar but not identical to the Article III minimum for standing\n          5\n\nto request an injunction, which requires ongoing harm or a threat of imminent harm. See\nCity of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 105, 103 S. Ct. 1660, 1667 (1983).\n\n          See Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n., 662 F.3d 336, 342 (5th Cir. 2011)\n          6\n\n(state did not waive Eleventh Amendment immunity defense by not raising it in the district\ncourt, where it defended the suit on the merits).\n                                               6\n\f    Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635      Page: 7    Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10923\nviolation of federal law.”    Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n., 535 U.S.\n635, 645, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 1761 (2002) (alteration in original).     NiGen points\nto the complaint’s straightforward allegations, of which there are many, that\nthe AG’s continued refusal (now after nearly four years) to justify its\nthreatening letters still inflicts, inter alia, an unconstitutional restraint on its\ncommercial speech, punishment without due process, and other constitutional\nviolations. These allegations are sufficient to demonstrate the ongoing nature\nof the alleged unconstitutional conduct, which a federal court could remedy\nthrough prospective relief.\n   B. Federal Question Jurisdiction\n      The parties also join issue over this court’s subject matter jurisdiction,\nyet all of NiGen’s claims except for tortious interference are brought under\n§ 1983, a federal statute, and allegedly arise under the U.S. Constitution.      “A\nsuit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.”      Am. Well Works\nCo. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U.S. 257, 260, 36 S. Ct. 585, 586 (1916).\n      The AG argues that all of the federal claims here are really defenses to\nits threatened DTPA enforcement action.           According to the well-pleaded\ncomplaint rule, federal jurisdiction is absent when the federal issue appears in\nthe guise of an anticipated defense.    E.g., New Orleans & Gulf Coast Ry. Co.\nv. Barrios, 533 F.3d 321, 328 (5th Cir. 2008).   And in an action for declaratory\njudgment, the inquiry is inverted: Since a declaratory judgment action is\ninherently anticipatory, the federal issue must form part of the hypothetical\nwell-pleaded complaint that the declaratory judgment defendant would have\nfiled but for the anticipatory action. See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum\nCo., 339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S. Ct. 876, 879 (1950).\n\n\n                                         7\n\f     Case: 14-10923       Document: 00513213635         Page: 8    Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-10923\n       To the extent that NiGen seeks as its first cause of action a declaration\nthat “its use of the letters ‘HCG’ on its packaging and labeling has not violated\nany federal law, and that Plaintiff is entitled to use the letters ‘HCG’ on its\npackaging and labeling for Isodrene and The HCG Solution,” the company’s\nallegations plainly assert a defense to a not-yet-commenced state enforcement\naction.    Although the question whether NiGen’s product and labelling\ncomport with federal FDA law may become a defense in such an enforcement\naction, this is hardly a sure thing; the State’s letters principally alleged\npotential violations of state deceptive trade practices law.          This court’s recent\ndecision in Singh v. Duane Morris LLP, 538 F.3d 334, 338 (5th Cir. 2008) set\nout a four-part test, determining that a federal court may exercise jurisdiction\nover a state law cause of action when:               “(1) resolving a federal issue is\nnecessary to the resolution of the state-law claim; (2) the federal issue is\nactually disputed; (3) the federal issue is substantial; and (4) federal\njurisdiction will not disturb the balance of federal and state judicial\nresponsibilities.”    The party asserting jurisdiction has the burden to prove all\nof these elements.      NiGen’s stand-alone pleading for declaratory relief plainly\ndoes not satisfy the first three tenets on the present state of the record.\n       The AG more generally contends that all of NiGen’s claims are\nessentially anticipatory defenses to the threatened enforcement action, hence\nall are barred.      We disagree with this proposition. A number of cases have\nheld that where a plaintiff in NiGen’s position seeks both declaratory and\ninjunctive relief, the Wycoff rule 7 does not prevent that plaintiff from\n\n       7 Public Service Comm’n. of Utah v. Wycoff Co., 344 U.S. 237, 248, 73 S. Ct. 236, 242-\n43 (1952)(looking to whether federal jurisdiction exists over threatened action, not the\ndefense, in a claim for declaratory relief).\n\n                                             8\n\f    Case: 14-10923    Document: 00513213635      Page: 9   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-10923\nestablishing federal jurisdiction. In A&R Pipeline Corp. v. Commissioner,\nState of Oklahoma, 860 F.2d 1571 (10th Cir. 1988) the court, when faced with\nan analogous case, sustained federal jurisdiction:\n      We express no opinion concerning the dicta in Wycoff and its\n      progeny because this suit is not based solely on a claim for\n      declaratory judgment but also includes a claim for injunction.\n                                          ...\n      The district court’s jurisdiction to resolve the pipeline’s claim for\n      injunction extends to enable the court also to resolve the issues\n      raised by the declaratory judgment action.\n\n\n   We reached a similar conclusion in Braniff International, Inc. v. Florida\nPublic Service Commission, 576 F.2d 1100 (5th Cir. 1978).       In that case we\nstated:\n      We hold that where a party seeks injunctive and declaratory relief\n      based upon the unconstitutionality of a state statute where there\n      are no other concrete impediments to a proper exercise of federal\n      question jurisdiction, the mere fact that the constitutional claims\n      might be raised before a state administrative body charged with\n      enforcement of the statute does not alone deprive the court of\n      jurisdiction.\n\n      Regardless of the ultimate merit of NiGen’s claims, with the sole\nexception of the stand-alone declaratory judgment cause of action, there is\nfederal question jurisdiction over the constitutional claims NiGen asserts\nunder § 1983.\n   C. Standing\n      The State also challenges NiGen’s standing to bring this suit. It is true\nthat “a plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief\nsought.”   Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,\n528 U.S. 167, 185, 120 S. Ct. 693, 706 (2000).

Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130,\n2136 (1992). However, the complaint need only “allege facts from which it\nreasonably could be inferred,” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 504, 95 S. Ct.\n2197, 2208 (1975), that it is “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the\ninjury will be redressed by a favorable decision,” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 61,\n112 S. Ct. at 2137 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      The injury-in-fact and traceability requirements are not disputed here.\nThe AG has again taken a different tack on appeal and for the first time\nchallenges redressability.   We must address this contention as it goes to\nfederal jurisdiction and cannot be waived, but the fact that it is late-raised\nreduces the credibility of the AG’s argument and disserves the efficiency of the\njudicial process.\n      In challenging redressability, the AG cites Lujan, which observed that\nstanding to challenge government action “depends considerably upon whether\nthe plaintiff is himself an object of the action (or forgone action) at issue.”\n504 U.S. at 561, 112 S. Ct. at 2137 (denying standing, in part because the only\nentities whose actions could redress the plaintiff’s alleged injury were\nnonparties that would not be bound by the judgment).       Further, in Simon v.\nEastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, the plaintiffs complained that\nan IRS revenue ruling allowed favorable tax treatment for hospitals that\ntreated indigents only in their emergency rooms (instead of also admitting\nthem to inpatient care). 426 U.S. 26, 33, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 1922 (1976).       The\nSupreme Court held that even an order forcing the IRS to change its policy\nwould not necessarily result in the hospitals admitting indigent patients.    Id.\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635        Page: 11   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                No. 14-10923\nat 43, 96 S. Ct. at 1926. The Court held that “unadorned speculation will not\nsuffice to invoke the federal judicial power.”      Id. at 44, 96 S. Ct. at 1927; see\nalso Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 758, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 3328 (1984) (IRS’s\nfailure to enforce tax disadvantage against discriminatory private schools\nwould not necessarily redress harm to students in segregated public schools).\n      These cases, however, turned on remedying conduct that was not\ninitially directed at the plaintiffs themselves. Here, the AG sent threatening\nletters not only to NiGen’s retailers in Texas but also to the company itself.\nAs NiGen cogently explains, “these letters harmed NiGen directly because they\namounted to a preliminary injunction against the lawful sale of NiGen’s\nproducts.   NiGen’s retailers removed the products from their shelves only as\na direct result of receiving the threatening letters from the Attorney General.”\nNiGen Reply Br. at 17.           Further, because “NiGen itself continues to be\neffectively enjoined from selling its products,” a favorable court decision “would\nallow NiGen to again sell its products freely in Texas, whether directly,\nthrough its prior retailers, through other retailers, etc.     It would allow NiGen\nto repair its damaged relationship with its retailers that has resulted from the\nAttorney General’s conduct.       This is not speculative and is not dependent on\nthe actions of third parties.”     Id. at 17-18.   As the Supreme Court has noted,\nwhere a plaintiff’s complaint alleges a continuing violation or the imminence\nof a future violation, a prayer for injunctive relief satisfies redressability.\nSteel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 108, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 1019\n(1998).\n      Other court decisions cited by the Attorney General have found the\n“chain of forward causation” to be broken for redressability purposes, but they\nare distinguishable.    For example, in Frank Krasner Enterprises, Ltd. v.\n                                           11\n\f   Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635      Page: 12   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                             No. 14-10923\nMontgomery County, the owner of an expo venue refused to grant a lease to a\nplaintiff gun vendor because of a law withdrawing local subsidies for shows\nwhere guns were sold. 401 F.3d 230, 232 (4th Cir. 2005).      The Fourth Circuit\nheld that even if the law were enjoined, the non-party owner might still decline\nto do business with the gun seller.      Id. at 236.   The court emphasized the\nabsence of a case granting standing to a plaintiff that challenged a\ngovernment’s decision not to subsidize a third party.            Id. at 235-36.\nSimilarly, in Glanton ex rel. ALCOA Prescription Drug Plan v. AdvancePCS\nInc., 465 F.3d 1123, 1125 (9th Cir. 2006), the plaintiffs were beneficiaries of a\nmismanaged ERISA drug plan.           But the court held that even if their suit\nagainst the manager’s misdeeds succeeded, it would not follow that the\nsponsors of the plan would reduce the price of the plaintiff’s benefits;\nconsequently, the court could not redress their alleged injury.      Id. at 1127.\nOf a similar nature is Pritikin v. Department of Energy, 254 F.3d 791, 799-801\n(9th Cir. 2001), in which the plaintiffs sued one federal agency on their claim\nthat it had to fund another, with no guarantee that a favorable judgment would\nin fact cause the funding to occur.\n      None of these cases sought, like NiGen’s, to lift a yoke of alleged\nunconstitutional conduct from the plaintiff’s own shoulders.       None of them\ninvolved government enforcement threats against third parties.       Were NiGen\nto succeed here and nullify the threats, the likelihood of NiGen’s success in\nreturning its products to store shelves in Texas, given the normal marketplace\nincentives, is much greater than in these other cases. We make no predictions\nabout the outcome of this case except to acknowledge that if NiGen succeeds in\nenjoining the AG’s conduct, which would require a retraction of the offending\n\n\n                                         12\n\f    Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635     Page: 13   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10923\nletters and/or the instigation of procedurally adequate enforcement measures,\nNiGen could again conduct business as usual.\n      The district court did not rule on the AG’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure\nto state a claim. For two reasons, we remand this ordinarily legal question to\nthat court.   First, nearly four years have passed since the delivery of the AG’s\nletters, and we cannot be certain that the facts concerning this case are the\nsame as they were when suit was filed.       Second, the dismissal motion seems\nto rely on discovery and matters outside the pleadings, suggesting that the\nentire record must be consulted, which is the province of summary judgment\nrather than a 12(b)(6) motion.     The district court is the better venue for this\nanalysis in the first instance.\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED insofar as it dismissed NiGen’s claims for money damages, for\nstate law violations, for retrospective relief, and for declaratory relief against\na threatened enforcement action; the judgment is REVERSED insofar as it\ndismissed NiGen’s constitutional law claims; and the case is REMANDED for\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f",

JONES, Circuit Judge:\n\n      A    manufacturer   and   distributor    of    over-the-counter          dietary\nsupplements, Isodrene and The HCG Solution, appeals the district court’s\norder dismissing its constitutional and state law claims against the Attorney\nGeneral of the State of Texas on the sole basis of state sovereign immunity.\nWe conclude that it is at least partially correct that NiGen’s claims are not\nbarred from federal jurisdiction on the basis of Ex parte Young; federal\njurisdiction plainly exists over most of the constitutional claims pled; and\n\f    Case: 14-10923      Document: 00513213635       Page: 2     Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-10923\nNiGen has standing to sue.       Accordingly, we affirm in part, and vacate and\nremand in part for further proceedings.\n                                 BACKGROUND\n      NiGen makes and sells dietary supplements, two of which contain the\n“individual amino acid building blocks” of prescription-drug ingredient hCG. 1\nThe company labels the packages of these products with the term “hCG,” which\nthe Attorney General of the State of Texas (the “AG” or the State) determined\nwas “false, misleading, or deceptive” in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act (“DTPA”) because, among other reasons, “the claim is trying to\nmimic claims that FDA considers off-label for the prescription drug.”               In\nOctober 2011, the AG sent letters to this effect to NiGen and its retailers,\nincluding CVS, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart, intimating that formal enforcement\nwas on the horizon for both NiGen and the retailers.          The retailers pulled the\nproducts from their shelves in Texas and other states, allegedly costing NiGen\nmillions of dollars in lost revenue.\n      NiGen filed suit in December 2011 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nviolations of its rights under the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment\nDue Process and Equal Protection Clauses, the Commerce Clause, and the\nSupremacy Clause.       The company also alleged a state law claim of tortious\ninterference with existing business relations. NiGen sought 1) a declaration\nthat its labeling did not violate federal law and that it was entitled to use\n“HCG” on its labels; 2) preliminary and permanent injunctive relief; 3) money\ndamages; and 4) costs and attorneys’ fees.\n\n      1  hCG is an acronym for human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, a protein found in\npregnant women that is an ingredient in prescription drugs sold under the brand names\nNovarel, Ovidrel, and Pregnyl.\n\n                                          2\n\f    Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635      Page: 3   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                             No. 14-10923\n      The AG moved for dismissal, alleging both jurisdictional and pleading\ndefects.   As for the jurisdictional claims, the AG argued that the plaintiff\nlacked Article III standing because the only injury to NiGen was the result of\nthird-party action; that the “federal statutory claim” was non-justiciable\nbecause NiGen asked for a declaration that its labeling did not violate FDA\nlaw, though the AG was never attempting to enforce federal law; and that state\nsovereign immunity barred the money damages and state law claims.             The\nAG alternatively averred that NiGen’s claims fail to state a claim as required\nby Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).    Substantial briefing and pretrial\nmotions preceded the submission of these motions to the court in July 2012.\n      For reasons not apparent in the record, the district court did not rule for\nalmost two years.    Then, despite the plethora of jurisdictional issues before it,\nthe court dismissed the entire case as barred by state sovereign immunity.\nNiGen seasonably appealed.\n                          STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      We review the trial court’s jurisdictional determinations de novo.\nFontenot v.

Notably, in the trial\ncourt, the AG did not move to dismiss NiGen’s federal claims for declaratory\nand injunctive relief on the grounds that they failed to request prospective\nrelief.

NiGen points\nto the complaint’s straightforward allegations, of which there are many, that\nthe AG’s continued refusal (now after nearly four years) to justify its\nthreatening letters still inflicts, inter alia, an unconstitutional restraint on its\ncommercial speech, punishment without due process, and other constitutional\nviolations. These allegations are sufficient to demonstrate the ongoing nature\nof the alleged unconstitutional conduct, which a federal court could remedy\nthrough prospective relief.\n   B. Federal Question Jurisdiction\n      The parties also join issue over this court’s subject matter jurisdiction,\nyet all of NiGen’s claims except for tortious interference are brought under\n§ 1983, a federal statute, and allegedly arise under the U.S. Constitution.      “A\nsuit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.”      Am.

According to the well-pleaded\ncomplaint rule, federal jurisdiction is absent when the federal issue appears in\nthe guise of an anticipated defense.    E.g., New Orleans & Gulf Coast Ry. Co.\nv.

And in an action for declaratory\njudgment, the inquiry is inverted: Since a declaratory judgment action is\ninherently anticipatory, the federal issue must form part of the hypothetical\nwell-pleaded complaint that the declaratory judgment defendant would have\nfiled but for the anticipatory action.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1019\n(1998).\n      Other court decisions cited by the Attorney General have found the\n“chain of forward causation” to be broken for redressability purposes, but they\nare distinguishable.    For example, in Frank Krasner Enterprises, Ltd. v.\n                                           11\n\f   Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635      Page: 12   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                             No. 14-10923\nMontgomery County, the owner of an expo venue refused to grant a lease to a\nplaintiff gun vendor because of a law withdrawing local subsidies for shows\nwhere guns were sold. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789586\"><a href=\"/opinion/789586/frank-krasner-enterprises-ltd-dba-silverado-gun-show-dba-silverado/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (4th Cir. 2005).      The Fourth Circuit\nheld that even if the law were enjoined, the non-party owner might still decline\nto do business with the gun seller.      Id. at 236.   The court emphasized the\nabsence of a case granting standing to a plaintiff that challenged a\ngovernment’s decision not to subsidize a third party.            Id. at 235-36.\nSimilarly, in Glanton ex rel. ALCOA Prescription Drug Plan v. AdvancePCS\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1125 (9th Cir. 2006), the plaintiffs were beneficiaries of a\nmismanaged ERISA drug plan.           But the court held that even if their suit\nagainst the manager’s misdeeds succeeded, it would not follow that the\nsponsors of the plan would reduce the price of the plaintiff’s benefits;\nconsequently, the court could not redress their alleged injury.      Id. at 1127.\nOf a similar nature is Pritikin v. Department of Energy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773755\"><a href=\"/opinion/773755/trisha-t-pritikin-v-department-of-energy-john-d-wagoner-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799-801\n(9th Cir. 2001), in which the plaintiffs sued one federal agency on their claim\nthat it had to fund another, with no guarantee that a favorable judgment would\nin fact cause the funding to occur.\n      None of these cases sought, like NiGen’s, to lift a yoke of alleged\nunconstitutional conduct from the plaintiff’s own shoulders.       None of them\ninvolved government enforcement threats against third parties.       Were NiGen\nto succeed here and nullify the threats, the likelihood of NiGen’s success in\nreturning its products to store shelves in Texas, given the normal marketplace\nincentives, is much greater than in these other cases. We make no predictions\nabout the outcome of this case except to acknowledge that if NiGen succeeds in\nenjoining the AG’s conduct, which would require a retraction of the offending\n\n\n                                         12\n\f    Case: 14-10923     Document: 00513213635     Page: 13   Date Filed: 09/30/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-10923\nletters and/or the instigation of procedurally adequate enforcement measures,\nNiGen could again conduct business as usual.\n      The district court did not rule on the AG’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure\nto state a claim. For two reasons, we remand this ordinarily legal question to\nthat court.   First, nearly four years have passed since the delivery of the AG’s\nletters, and we cannot be certain that the facts concerning this case are the\nsame as they were when suit was filed.       Second, the dismissal motion seems\nto rely on discovery and matters outside the pleadings, suggesting that the\nentire record must be consulted, which is the province of summary judgment\nrather than a 12(b)(6) motion.     The district court is the better venue for this\nanalysis in the first instance.\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED insofar as it dismissed NiGen’s claims for money damages, for\nstate law violations, for retrospective relief, and for declaratory relief against\na threatened enforcement action; the judgment is REVERSED insofar as it\ndismissed NiGen’s constitutional law claims; and the case is REMANDED for\nfurther proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f</pre>",
