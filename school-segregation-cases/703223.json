County School Board of New Kent County, 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716, and Alexander v.

The plan assigns all students in the district (1,852 whites, 2,388 blacks) to five different schools according to grade attended.  Racial segregation is virtually impossible since all the children in a particular grade attend the same school irrespective of the physical location of the student's home within the district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the West Point school plan closed two schools<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> solely because of the fear on the part of the Board of Trustees that whites would not attend these formerly all-Negro schools located within the black neighborhood.  As a result of the schools being closed, less classroom space became available so that the remaining five schools were forced to conduct classes on a 'split session'<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or 'two shift a day' basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The closing of these schools for purely racial reasons is impermissible under Brown v.

While it is undisputed that a particular school may be terminated for sound educational reasons, an otherwise useful building may not be closed merely because the school board speculates that whites will refuse to attend the location.  Such action constitutes racial discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we hold that Fifth Street Junior and Senior High School and Northside Elementary School cannot be closed for the reasons shown in the record below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is hereby remanded to the district court with directions to formulate a school desegregation plan not inconsistent with this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remanded with directions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">CLARK, Circuit Judge (specially concurring):</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under our recent decision in Lee v.

This majority black school district is the sole such example known to me which has been able to move from a totally segregated past to a totally integrated present, while preserving a disciplined atmosphere in which a meaningful education for pupils of both races has been afforded.  Unless the trial court finds it must determine that this accomplishment was made at a constitutionally impermissible sacrifice on the part of the black community then the law does not require this court to intervene.
