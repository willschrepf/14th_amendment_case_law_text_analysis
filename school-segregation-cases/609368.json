This case brings before this court\n\nthe third in a series of law suits by Gregorio Igartúa, a U.S.\n\ncitizen resident in Puerto Rico, claiming the constitutional right\n\nto vote quadrennially for President and Vice President of the\n\nUnited States.    Panels of this court have rejected such claims on\n\nall three occasions.1        We now do so again, this time en banc,\n\nrejecting as well an adjacent claim: that the failure of the\n\nConstitution to grant this vote should be declared a violation of\n\nU.S. treaty obligations.\n\n          The constitutional claim is readily answered. Voting for\n\nPresident and Vice President of the United States is governed\n\nneither by rhetoric nor intuitive values but by a provision of the\n\nConstitution.    This provision does not confer the franchise on\n\n\"U.S. citizens\" but on \"Electors\" who are to be \"appoint[ed]\" by\n\neach \"State,\" in \"such Manner\" as the state legislature may direct,\n\nequal to the number of Senators and Representatives to whom the\n\nstate is entitled.     U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 2; see also id.\n\namend. XII.\n\n          At    one   time   state   legislatures   chose   the   electors\n\nthemselves, see McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U.S. 1, 28-35 (1892); in\n\n\n     1\n      Igartua de la Rosa v. United States, 32 F.3d 8 (1st Cir.\n1994) (\"Igartúa I\"); Igartua de la Rosa v. United States, 229 F.3d\n80 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Igartúa II\"); Igartúa-de la Rosa v. United\nStates, 386 F.3d 313 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Igartúa III\"). The panel in\nIgartúa III vacated its own decision and granted panel rehearing,\n404 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2005); and this court then granted en banc\nreview, 407 F.3d 30 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fthe modern manner, customarily a U.S. state provides that its own\n\ncitizens--citizens     of    that   state--vote     for    the   electors    to\n\nrepresent that state.        Modern ballots may omit the names of the\n\nelectors and list only the candidates, so in form it appears that\n\ncitizens are voting for President and Vice President directly. But\n\nthey are not: they are voting for electors and, more pertinent\n\nhere, the electors are electors of the states.\n\n           Puerto Rico--like the District of Columbia, the Virgin\n\nIslands, and Guam--is not a \"state\" within the meaning of the\n\nConstitution.     Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez,\n\n977 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 1992).         Puerto Rico was not one of the\n\noriginal 13 states who ratified the Constitution; nor has it been\n\nmade a state, like the other 37 states added thereafter, pursuant\n\nto the process laid down in the Constitution.         U.S. Const. art. IV,\n\n§ 3, cl. 1.   Nor has it been given electors of its own, as was the\n\nDistrict of Columbia in the Twenty-Third Amendment.\n\n           Puerto Rico became associated with the United States as\n\nan unincorporated territory under Article IV of the Constitution\n\nfollowing the 1898 war between this country and Spain. U.S. Const.\n\nart. IV, § 3, cl. 2; see Insular Cases, 182 U.S. 1 (1901).                  Its\n\nstatus has altered over the ensuing period, culminating in an\n\nagreement in 1952, approved by the citizens of Puerto Rico, that\n\nPuerto Rico should have a unique \"Commonwealth\" status; but the\n\nunique   status   is   not    statehood    within    the    meaning   of    the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fConstitution.      See Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 7; Igartúa II, 229\n\nF.3d at 87-88 & nn.15-16 (Torruella, J., concurring).                  And, in\n\nrecent elections, Puerto Ricans themselves have been substantially\n\ndivided as to whether to seek statehood status.                 Cf. Rossello-\n\nGonzalez v. Calderon-Serra, 398 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           As Puerto Rico has no electors, its citizens do not\n\nparticipate in the presidential voting, although they may do so if\n\nthey take up residence in one of the 50 states and, of course, they\n\nelect the Governor of Puerto Rico, its legislature, and a non-\n\nvoting delegate to Congress.      Like each state's entitlement to two\n\nSenators regardless of population, the make-up of the electoral\n\ncollege   is   a   direct   consequence    of   how    the   framers    of   the\n\nConstitution chose to structure our government--a choice itself\n\nbased on political compromise rather than conceptual perfection.\n\nNote,   Rethinking    the   Electoral     College     Debate:   The    Framers,\n\nFederalism, and One Person, One Vote, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 2526, 2526-\n\n31 (2001) (discussing historical commentary).\n\n           That the franchise for choosing electors is confined to\n\n\"states\" cannot be \"unconstitutional\" because it is what the\n\nConstitution itself provides.      Hence it does no good to stress how\n\nimportant is \"the right to vote\" for President.                  Although we\n\nrecognize the loyalty, contributions, and sacrifices of those who\n\nare in common citizens of Puerto Rico and the United States, much\n\nthe same could have been said about the citizens of the District of\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fColumbia, who were voteless over a much longer period.   The path to\n\nchanging the Constitution lies not through the courts but through\n\nthe constitutional amending process, U.S. Const. art. V; and the\n\nroad to statehood--if that is what Puerto Rico's citizens want--\n\nruns through Congress.   U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 1.\n\n          This court has thrice rejected the constitutional claim\n\nnow advanced by Igartúa. The Ninth Circuit reached the same result\n\nin a similar suit concerning Guam.       Attorney General of the\n\nTerritory of Guam v. United States, 738 F.2d 1017 (9th Cir. 1984).\n\nThe Supreme Court denied certiorari in both Igartúa I, 514 U.S.\n\n1049 (1995), and in the Ninth Circuit case, 469 U.S. 1209 (1985).\n\nIgartúa has offered nothing new in this third case to support his\n\nconstitutional claim.    In this en banc decision, we now put the\n\nconstitutional claim fully at rest: it not only is unsupported by\n\nthe Constitution but is contrary to its provisions.\n\n          Igartúa's complaint also relied upon U.S. treaties–-\n\ntechnically, two of the three are not treaties--as a premise for\n\nthe suffrage right claimed.2   This theory had been advanced and\n\nrejected by this court in Igartúa I, 32 F.3d at 10 n.1, which was\n\n\n\n     2\n      The first two of the three documents are not \"treaties\" in\nthe constitutional sense, being instead aspirational documents\nnever submitted by the President for Senate ratification. U.S.\nConst. art. II, § 2, cl. 2.       Neither is listed in the State\nDepartment's current \"treaties in force\" list. U.S. Department of\nState, Treaties in Force 2004, at www.state.gov/s/l/38294.htm. For\nconvenience, we ignore the distinction because it does not affect\nthe result in this case.\n\n                                -6-\n\fbinding on the panel and could not be altered by it.            Charlesbank\n\nEquity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 160 & n.4 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).      After the panel granted rehearing in this case to\n\nexamine a more elaborate version of the treaty argument, the en\n\nbanc court determined that the matter should be heard by the full\n\ncourt.    Two of the three panel members said that they were content\n\nwith this course.       Only one judge dissented from the proposal to\n\nhear the case en banc.        See Igartúa de la Rosa, 407 F.3d 30.\n\n              No treaty claim, even if entertained, would permit a\n\ncourt    to   order    that   the   electoral   college   be   enlarged   or\n\nreapportioned.        Treaties--sometimes--have the force of domestic\n\nlaw, just like legislation; but the Constitution is the supreme law\n\nof the land, and neither a statute nor a treaty can override the\n\nConstitution.     Reid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 16-18 (1957) (plurality\n\nopinion); Matter of Burt, 737 F.2d 1477, 1484 (7th Cir. 1984);\n\nPlaster v. United States, 720 F.2d 340, 348 (4th Cir. 1983)\n\n(collecting case law).         See also Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1\n\nCranch.) 137, 180 (1803) (\"a law repugnant to the constitution is\n\nvoid\").       So the treaty claim, originally made in support of\n\ninjunctive relief, is now recast by proponents as a demand for \"a\n\ndeclaration\" that the United States is in violation of its treaty\n\nobligations for failing to \"take steps\" to give a presidential vote\n\nto citizens of Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f             There are a host of problems with the treaty claim,\n\nincluding personal standing, redressability, the existence of a\n\ncause of action, and the merits of the treaty interpretations\n\noffered.     Treaties are made between states (in the international\n\nusage of that term) and citizens do not automatically have a right\n\nto   sue   upon    them.3      The    present    claim    is   also   probably     not\n\njusticiable       in    the   sense    that   any   effective     relief   could   be\n\nprovided;4    it       is   enough    to   let   common   sense    play    upon    the\n\nconjecture that the Constitution would be amended if only a federal\n\ncourt declared that a treaty's generalities so required.                           See\n\nSimon, 426 U.S. at 44 (\"unadorned speculation [as to redress] will\n\nnot suffice to invoke the federal judicial power\").\n\n             Nor are the merits of Igartúa’s reading of the treaties\n\nat all straightforward.               The language of each of the treaties\n\ninvoked is general.           Nothing in them says anything about just who\n\nshould be entitled to vote for whom, or that an entity with the\n\n\n\n      3\n      See United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(en banc) (\"[T]reaties do not generally create rights that are\nprivately enforceable in the federal courts\" (citing Head Money\nCases, 112 U.S. 580, 598 (1884)); id. at 61 (\"presumption against\nprivate rights of action under international treaties\").\n      4\n      Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38 (1976)\n(unless injury is \"likely to be redressed by a favorable decision,\"\nfederal court's exercise of power \"would be gratuitous and thus\ninconsistent with the Art. III limitation\"); Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992)(redressability must not be\n\"speculative\").    See also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 103-04, 103 n.5 (1998) (redressability at\n\"core\" of Article III).\n\n                                           -8-\n\fnegotiated relationship that the United States has with Puerto Rico\n\nis nevertheless required to adopt some different arrangement as to\n\ngovernance or suffrage.   In 1951, Puerto Ricans themselves acceded\n\nto their present Commonwealth status,5 and they are today divided\n\nas to what relationship they would prefer on the spectrum from\n\nstatehood to Commonwealth status to independence.\n\n           We think it unnecessary to plumb these questions, whether\n\nof preconditions to suit or the meaning of the treaties, because\n\nnone of these treaties comprises domestic law of the United States\n\nand so their status furnishes the clearest ground for denying\n\ndeclaratory relief.   It is well settled that declaratory relief is\n\ndiscretionary, Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 U.S. 277, 287 (1995),\n\nbut discretion does not mean anything that a judge feels like\n\ndoing.   Rather,\n\n           the discretion to grant declaratory relief is\n           to be exercised with great circumspection when\n           matters of public moment are involved, . . .\n           or when a request for relief threatens to drag\n           a    federal     court    prematurely     into\n           constitutional issues that are freighted with\n           uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      See G.A. Res. 748 (VIII), U.N. GAOR, 8th Sess., 459th plen.\nmtg. at 26 (1953) (United Nations General Assembly, upon formation\nof \"political association\" between United States and Puerto Rico,\n\"[r]ecognizes that the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,\nby expressing their will in a free and democratic way, have\nachieved a new constitutional status\" and \"that, when choosing\ntheir constitutional and international status, the people of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico have effectively exercised their right\nto self-determination\").\n\n                                -9-\n\fErnst & Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp., 45 F.3d 530,\n\n535 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            It would not be \"circumspection\" but patent imprudence to\n\n\"declare\" purported rights under the treaties at issue in this\n\ncase.     The United States has signed numerous treaties over the\n\nyears, many containing highly general and ramifying statements.\n\nSome as negotiated by the President are merely aspirational and not\n\nlaw in any sense.    Others may comprise international commitments,\n\nbut they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted\n\nimplementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention\n\nthat it be \"self-executing\" and is ratified on these terms.      The\n\nlaw to this effect is longstanding.     See Whitney v. Robertson, 124\n\nU.S. 190, 194 (1888);   Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314\n\n(1829) (Marshall, C.J.).\n\n            The treaties in question here do not adopt any legal\n\nobligations binding as a matter of domestic law.       The Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights is precatory: that is, it creates\n\naspirational goals but not legal obligations, even as between\n\nstates.    Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 2767 (2004).\n\nThis is also true of the Inter-American Democratic Charter.6     The\n\n\n     6\n      See Remarks of U.S. Ambassador Roger Noriega at Organization\nof American States Permanent Council Meeting (Sept. 6, 2001), in\nDigest of United States Practice in International Law: 2001 at 347,\nOffice of the Legal Advisor, U.S. Department of State (Sally J.\nCummins & David P. Stewart eds., 2001) (\"[T]he United States\nunderstands that this Charter does not establish any new rights or\nobligations under either domestic or international law.\").\n\n                                 -10-\n\ffinal instrument, the International Covenant on Civil and Political\n\nRights, is a ratified treaty but was submitted and ratified on the\n\nexpress condition that it would be \"not self-executing.\" 138 Cong.\n\nRec. S4781, S4784 (daily ed. Apr. 2, 1992).       Indeed, Sosa used it\n\nas an example of such a treaty, saying:\n\n            Several    times,  indeed,   the   Senate   has\n            expressly declined to give the federal courts\n            the   task    of  interpreting   and   applying\n            international human rights law, as when its\n            ratification of the International Covenant on\n            Civil and Political Rights declared that the\n            substantive provisions of the document were\n            not self-executing.\n\n124 S. Ct. at 2763.\n\n            Whatever limited room there may be for courts to second-\n\nguess the joint position of the President and the Senate that a\n\ntreaty is not self-executing--and we are pretty skeptical of such\n\na suggestion in light of \"the discretion of the Legislative and\n\nExecutive   Branches   in   managing   foreign   affairs,\"    id.--it   is\n\ncertainly not present in a case in which the Supreme Court has\n\nexpressed its own understanding of a specific treaty in the terms\n\nblock quoted above.    Indeed, only a few pages later Sosa repeated:\n\n\"[T]he   United   States    ratified   the   Covenant   on   the   express\n\nunderstanding that it was not self-executing and so did not itself\n\ncreate obligations enforceable in the federal courts.\"             Id. at\n\n2767.\n\n            When the President negotiates a precatory agreement or a\n\nnon-self-executing treaty, and when Congress refuses to adopt\n\n                                  -11-\n\fimplementing legislation for a non-self-executing treaty, both are\n\nperforming functions entrusted to them by the Constitution.                  U.S.\n\nConst. art. I, §§ 1, 8-10; art. II, §§ 2-3.               It would ignore, and\n\nundermine,    this      constitutional    allocation      of    functions   for   a\n\nfederal court to declare that the United States was nevertheless\n\n\"violating\" such a treaty.         In substance, such an exercise would\n\nattempt to do what the President and Congress have declined to do,\n\nnamely, to deploy the treaty provision in an attempt to order\n\ndomestic arrangements within the United States.\n\n            This intrusive course could also embarrass the United\n\nStates in the conduct of its foreign affairs, which is \"committed\n\nby   the   Constitution      to   the    executive       and   legislative--'the\n\npolitical'--departments of the government.\"                    Oetjen v. Central\n\nLeather    Co.,   246    U.S.   297,    302    (1918).     Whatever   the   State\n\nDepartment might later say, such a declaration by a federal court\n\nof a supposed \"treaty obligation\" could be trumpeted as propaganda\n\nin international bodies and elsewhere.                   This is a legitimate\n\nconcern in considering whether \"discretion\" should be exercised to\n\ngrant declaratory relief.7         Of course, no such declaration would\n\nconfer a presidential vote on Igartúa: it would merely reinforce\n\n\n      7\n      See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 412,\n431-33 (1964) (weighing possibility of \"embarrassment to the\nExecutive Branch in handling foreign affairs\"); Baker v. Carr, 369\nU.S. 186, 217 (1962) (\"potentiality of embarrassment from\nmultifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question\"\nrelevant to justiciability). See also United States v. Lee, 106\nU.S. 196, 209 (1882).\n\n                                        -12-\n\fthe disturbing view that judges have no proper notion of where\n\ntheir own authority ends.\n\n           The case for giving Puerto Ricans the right to vote in\n\npresidential elections is fundamentally a political one and must be\n\nmade through political means.       But the right claimed cannot be\n\nimplemented by courts unless Puerto Rico becomes a state or until\n\nthe Constitution is changed (as it has been, at least five times,\n\nto broaden the franchise).      U.S. Const. amend. XV (race, color,\n\nprevious   servitude);   id.   amend.    XIX   (sex);   id.   amend.   XXIII\n\n(District of Columbia); id. amend. XXIV (payment of poll or other\n\ntax); id. amend. XXVI (age eighteen and older).               It certainly\n\nshould not be \"declared\" by a federal court on the basis of\n\ntreaties none of which was designed to alter domestic law--and none\n\nof which could override the Constitution.\n\n           Little need be said of Igartúa's related claim that\n\ncustomary international law, by itself and independent of treaties,\n\nrequires that he be allowed to vote for President.                Although\n\nsometimes said by enthusiasts to be law like other law, customary\n\ninternational law is a diffuse and often highly uncertain body of\n\nnorms whose force and enforceability vary greatly even in the\n\ninternational sphere; and its status in our domestic courts is even\n\nmore qualified.   See Sosa, 124 S. Ct. at 2762-63, 2768-69.\n\n           Only recently, in Sosa, the Supreme Court enjoined great\n\ncaution in importing such norms into domestic law, even in the\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fcontext of a federal statute governing alien tort actions that\n\narguably authorized some degree of importation by federal courts.\n\nSosa refused to recognize as a norm of customary international law\n\nthe notion of protection against arbitrary arrest.                 124 S. Ct. at\n\n2769.    Yet the claim rejected in Sosa was a model of precision\n\ncompared to Igartúa's present claim.\n\n              No serious argument exists that customary international\n\nlaw, independent of the treaties now invoked, requires a particular\n\nform    of    representative    government.           Practice    among   leading\n\ndemocratic nations shows a diversity as to how governments organize\n\nand structure the franchise; in Great Britain, for example, neither\n\nthe head of state nor of government is directly elected by the\n\npublic   at    large.    If    there   exists    an    international      norm   of\n\ndemocratic government, it is at a level of generality so high as to\n\nbe unsuitable for importation into domestic law.                 Sosa, 124 S. Ct.\n\nat 2768 n.27.\n\n              Finally, other supporters of Igartúa's claim suggest that\n\nthe United States need not \"amend the Constitution\" to resolve the\n\nasserted infirmity of having Puerto Ricans classed as citizens of\n\nthe United States but unable to vote for President.                 For example,\n\nPuerto Rico could be made a state or, alternatively, could be\n\nrecognized as an independent nation.            Granting the declaration, it\n\nis claimed, would encourage the United States to \"take steps\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\ftoward a resolution even if it did not immediately secure a vote\n\nfor Igartúa.\n\n          This is, of course, nothing but speculation, but it\n\nfurther underscores the impropriety of the judicial declaration\n\nsought.   The main impact of such an abstract declaration, if any,\n\nwould be to serve partisans in a political campaign as to the\n\nchoice between statehood, independence, Commonwealth status, or\n\nother altered arrangements between Puerto Rico and the United\n\nStates.   Changes to the Constitution and the present status of\n\nPuerto Rico are not the province of federal judges, nor are they\n\ndictated by international law; those changes can only be adopted as\n\nset forth in the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            Concurring and dissenting opinions follow.\n\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\f           CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.           I join in\n\nChief Judge Boudin's excellent opinion for the majority, but I also\n\nnote my subscription to Judge Lipez's narrower concurrence.            The\n\ntwo are not in conflict.     The majority's opinion recognizes the\n\npossible validity of Judge Lipez's belief that the court here lacks\n\njurisdiction to grant declaratory relief.      I happen to think Judge\n\nLipez is right, and, if so, that of course ends the matter.             But\n\neven apart from the correctness of his approach, I agree with Chief\n\nJudge   Boudin's   alternative   analysis   which   leads   to   the   same\n\noutcome.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f              LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.              I\n\nagree with the majority's denial of relief to Igartúa.                I write\n\nseparately, however, because I would reject Igartúa's request for\n\ndeclaratory relief on jurisdictional grounds.\n\n                                        I.\n\n              I am sympathetic to the aspirations of Puerto Ricans who\n\nare citizen residents of Puerto Rico to participate fully in the\n\nelection of the President and Vice President of the United States.\n\nThe dissenting judges present their legal positions in support of\n\nthose   aspirations     powerfully      and   eloquently.      Nevertheless,\n\n\"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\" Kokkonen v.\n\nGuardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994), and that\n\nlimited jurisdiction does not permit us to decide the issues raised\n\nby Igartúa's request for declaratory relief.\n\n              It may seem odd to some that a federal court might not\n\nhave the power to answer important legal questions involving the\n\ninteraction between the Constitution, international law, and the\n\nrights of American citizens.         But, as I will explain below, one\n\ncannot simply go to federal court and get an answer to a legal\n\nquestion. Before a federal court can resolve the issues before it,\n\nthe   court    must   first   satisfy    itself   that,   if   the   plaintiff\n\nultimately won, the decision would probably result in a redress of\n\nthe plaintiff's grievance.        If a judicial victory would probably\n\nnot produce such a result, the federal court has no power to\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\faddress the merits of the issues underlying the dispute.   In most\n\ncases redressability is not a problem.      In this case, however,\n\nredressability is an insuperable problem.\n\n          As the majority ably explains, there are only two methods\n\nunder our Constitution by which a territory can receive electoral\n\nvotes: through admission as a state, see U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3,\n\ncl. 1, or by special amendment, see id. amend. XXIII.      For all\n\npractical purposes, only Congress can perform either of these\n\nactions, and whether to do so is in Congress's sole discretion.8\n\nThus, the critical jurisdictional question reduces to whether a\n\ncourt can declare Congress's failure to initiate either of these\n\nprocesses to be a violation of international law -- or, as Judge\n\nTorruella puts it, whether a court can issue a declaratory judgment\n\nthat \"the United States has taken no steps to meet its obligations\n\nunder the ICCPR and customary international law to grant equal\n\nvoting rights to all citizens in the election of the President and\n\nVice President of the United States.\"   Post at 88 (Torruella, J.,\n\ndissenting).\n\n          In my view, the answer to this jurisdictional question\n\ndoes not turn on the precise contents of the particular agreements\n\nat issue; whether the agreements are binding or merely \"precatory\";\n\n\n\n     8\n      There is an exception, in theory: if two-thirds of state\nlegislatures so request, Congress must convene a Constitutional\nconvention. See U.S. Const. art. V. However, no such convention\nhas ever been convened since the adoption of the Constitution.\n\n                               -18-\n\fwhether they have been ratified by the Senate; whether they are\n\nself-executing; or even whether the relevant international legal\n\nnorms derive from agreements at all, as opposed to customary law.\n\nNor   does   the    answer     turn   on    the    discretionary         nature    of   a\n\ndeclaratory     judgment.        Even      if    those    factors    were    removed,\n\nIgartúa's request for declaratory relief would still face an\n\ninsuperable     obstacle:       we    lack       jurisdiction       to    decide    his\n\ninternational law claim because his grievance is not judicially\n\nredressable.       See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523\n\nU.S. 83, 101 (1998) (court must address Article III jurisdictional\n\nquestions     before     addressing        merits,       because    \"[h]ypothetical\n\njurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgment --\n\nwhich   comes      to   the    same   thing       as     an   advisory     opinion\").\n\nUnavoidably, Igartúa's request for a declaratory judgment requires\n\nunsupportable speculation about the possibility of a Constitutional\n\namendment or the admission of Puerto Rico as a state.                        For this\n\nreason alone, I conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over his\n\nrequest for declaratory relief.\n\n                                           II.\n\n             Under Article III of the Constitution, \"[t]he judicial\n\nPower shall extend\" to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\"                       U.S. Const.\n\nart. III, § 2, cl. 1.         The Supreme Court has interpreted this \"case\n\nor controversy\" requirement to mean, among other things, that\n\nfederal courts do not issue advisory opinions.                     In particular, a\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\ffederal court may only exercise jurisdiction over an action if it\n\nis \"'likely,' as opposed to merely 'speculative,' that the injury\n\nwill be 'redressed by a favorable decision.'\"    Lujan v. Defenders\n\nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992) (quoting Simon v. E. Ky.\n\nWelfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 43 (1976)).   If the plaintiff\n\ncannot show that his injury \"is likely to be redressed by a\n\nfavorable decision,\" the federal court's \"exercise of its power\n\n. . . would be gratuitous and thus inconsistent with the Art. III\n\nlimitation.\"   Simon, 426 U.S. at 38. This limitation applies with\n\nundiminished force to actions for declaratory judgment.         See\n\nCalderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740, 745 (1998) (\"[W]e must first\n\naddress whether this action for a declaratory judgment is the sort\n\nof 'Article III' 'case or controversy' to which federal courts are\n\nlimited.\"); Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth, 300 U.S. 227, 240\n\n(1937) (The Declaratory Judgment Act \"is operative only in respect\n\nto controversies which are such in the constitutional sense.\").\n\n          This is not a case where a plaintiff claims injury from\n\nan allegedly unconstitutional act of Congress.      Rather, Igartúa\n\nclaims injury from Congress's inaction in the face of certain\n\ninternational agreements: its failure to either admit Puerto Rico\n\nas a state or to propose a Constitutional amendment allocating\n\nelectors to Puerto Rico.9   Since it is beyond dispute that we could\n\n     9\n      The dissents suggest that there might be other alternatives\nby which Congress could grant the Presidential vote to residents of\nPuerto Rico. The only specific suggestion is one first advanced by\nJudge Leval in Romeu v. Cohen, 265 F.3d 118, 128-30 (2d Cir. 2001)\n\n                                -20-\n\fnot order Congress to do either of those things, Judge Torruella\n\nsays that we should issue a declaratory judgment that Congress has\n\nnot fulfilled its duties under international agreements.           Judge\n\nTorruella then says that Congress, chastened by this declaration,\n\nwould voluntarily choose to act -- presumably either by admitting\n\nPuerto Rico as a state or proposing an amendment similar to the\n\nTwenty-third.    In Judge Torruella's view, \"it is substantially\n\nlikely that a declaration by this Court that the United States is\n\nin violation of international law will result in some form of\n\nrelief to the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nPost at 80 (Torruella, J., dissenting).\n\n          Respectfully,   the   basis   for   this   speculation   about\n\nCongress initiating the process of Constitutional amendment or\n\ninvoking the Constitutional process for the admission of a new\n\nstate is unexplained.   We have already warned about the hazards of\n\nsuch speculation when only statutory changes by a state legislature\n\nwere at stake.   In Biszko v. RIHT Financial Corp., 758 F.2d 769\n\n\n\n(Leval, J., writing separately), under which Congress would require\neach state to accept a proportional share of territorial voters.\nSee post at 89 (Howard, J., dissenting). This suggestion has been\ncritiqued on the ground that there is \"no authority in the\nConstitution for the Congress (even with the states' consent) to\nenact such a provision.\"    Romeu, 265 F.3d at 121 (Walker, Jr.,\nC.J., concurring); see also id. at 136 (Walker, Jr., C.J.,\nconcurring) (\"I see only two remedies afforded by the Constitution:\n(1) statehood . . ., or (2) a constitutional amendment.\"). At any\nrate, for purposes of redressability analysis, it is no more likely\nthat Congress would adopt Judge Leval's suggestion (which is\nprobably not Constitutionally permissible) than one of the two\nalternatives that the Constitution provides.\n\n                                -21-\n\f(1st Cir. 1985), plaintiffs challenged a Rhode Island statute that\n\narguably created market conditions under which plaintiffs could not\n\nreceive full market value for their shares in a Rhode Island bank.10\n\nThey argued that their suit was redressable because if the federal\n\ncourt invalidated the statute, \"the Rhode Island legislature would\n\nsoon be moved, sua sponte or by the persuasive efforts of non-New\n\nEngland banks, to pass a statute permitting [a more competitive\n\nmarket].\" Id. at 773. We described such speculation concerning \"a\n\nbenefit   that   [plaintiffs]   might   gain   were   the   Rhode    Island\n\nlegislature to react in a certain way to a decision by this court\"\n\nas \"not merely speculative\" but \"positively chimerical.\"            Id.11\n\n           If a legislative body would be within its rights to\n\nignore the court's decision, and the plaintiff cannot convince the\n\ncourt that it is \"'likely,' as opposed to merely 'speculative,'\"\n\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 561, that the legislature will react in the way\n\nthat he hopes, the redressability requirement has not been met.\n\nCf. Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S.\n\n103, 113 (1948) (\"[I]f the President may completely disregard the\n\n     10\n      The statute permitted a Rhode Island bank to be acquired by\nan out-of-state bank, but only if the other bank was based in\nanother New England state. The plaintiffs were shareholders of a\nRhode Island bank that had agreed to merge with a Massachusetts\nbank, and they sought to block the merger.    See id. at 770-71.\nThey argued that the limitation to New England banks reduced\ncompetition and that, without that restriction, an out-of-state\nbank would have had to pay more for their stock. See id. at 771.\n     11\n      We analyzed this argument under the rubric of the \"injury\"\nrequirement, but our reasoning on that point applies to the\nredressability requirement.\n\n                                 -22-\n\fjudgment of the court, it would be only because it is one the\n\ncourts were not authorized to render. Judgments, within the powers\n\nvested in courts by the Judiciary Article of the Constitution, may\n\nnot lawfully be revised, overturned or refused faith and credit by\n\nanother    Department    of    Government.\").         The    cases        that    Judge\n\nTorruella cites for the contrary proposition (that Congress would\n\nbe \"substantially likely\" to redress Igartúa's grievance in light\n\nof a judicial declaration) are easily distinguishable and actually\n\nreveal why the redressability requirement prevents declaratory\n\nrelief here.\n\n            Judge Torruella relies on Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452\n\n(2002), a dispute ultimately stemming from the Census Bureau's\n\nmethod of calculating population in the 2000 census.                      The Bureau\n\nused a statistical method that calculated the population of Utah as\n\nsomewhat lower, relative to the population of North Carolina, than\n\nif the Bureau had not used that method.                     See id. at 457-58.\n\nPursuant   to   statute,      the   Bureau's      final    report    was    formally\n\ntransmitted     to   Congress,      and   the      Clerk    of      the    House     of\n\nRepresentatives      then   transmitted      to    each    state     governor       \"'a\n\ncertificate of the number of Representatives to which [that] State\n\n[was] entitled.'\"       Id. at 461 (quoting 2 U.S.C. § 2a(b)).                   Due to\n\nthe statistical method that the Bureau used, Utah received one less\n\nrepresentative, and North Carolina one more representative, than if\n\nthe Bureau had not used that method.            Id. at 458.      After receiving\n\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fthe results, Utah sued the government, arguing that the Bureau's\n\nstatistical method violated another census-related statute, and\n\nsought an injunction ordering the Bureau to reissue its report with\n\ndifferent results.   Id. at 459.\n\n          North Carolina intervened, arguing that the case was not\n\njusticiable because the relief sought would not redress Utah's\n\ngrievance. Although North Carolina \"[did] not deny that the courts\n\n[could] order the [Bureau] to recalculate the numbers and to\n\nrecertify the official census result,\" it reasoned that \"Utah\n\nsuffer[ed], not simply from the lack of a proper census 'report' (a\n\ndocument), but more importantly from the lack of the additional\n\ncongressional   Representative   to   which   North   Carolina   believes\n\nitself entitled as a consequence of the filing of that document.\"\n\nId. at 461.    In other words, although the court could order a new\n\ncensus report as Utah requested, a new report would not result in\n\nUtah gaining a Representative.     That outcome would depend entirely\n\non whether Congress, acting in its unbridled discretion, would\n\nchoose to reapportion, or just ignore the report.\n\n          The Court concluded that the injury cited by Utah was\n\nredressable:\n\n          [W]e believe it likely that Utah's victory\n          here would bring about the ultimate relief\n          that Utah seeks. Victory would mean a\n          declaration   leading,    or   an   injunction\n          requiring, the Secretary to substitute a new\n          \"report\" for the old one.      Should the new\n          report contain a different conclusion about\n          the relative populations of North Carolina and\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\f            Utah, the relevant calculations and consequent\n            apportionment-related steps would be purely\n            mechanical; and several months would remain\n            prior   to   the     first    post-2000   census\n            congressional      election.      Under    these\n            circumstances,    it    would   seem    .  .   .\n            \"substantially likely that the President and\n            other executive and congressional officials\n            would abide by an authoritative interpretation\n            of the census statute . . . .\"\n\nId. at 463-64 (quoting Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803\n\n(1992) (opinion of O'Connor, J.)).          Two points about Evans bear\n\nemphasis.     First,   compliance    with    the   actual   court   order   or\n\ndeclaration relating to the need for a new census report \"would be\n\npurely mechanical.\"      536 U.S. at 463.          Second, while ultimate\n\nredress of Utah's grievance would require discretionary action by\n\nelected officials, that action -- recertifying the total number of\n\nRepresentatives for two states -- was of a piece with a process so\n\nregular     and   commonplace   that       Congress   has,    in    ordinary\n\ncircumstances, delegated it by statute to the Clerk of the House.12\n\nHere, by contrast, the Congressional action envisioned (admitting\n\na state or initiating the process of Constitutional amendment) is\n\nexceptional, lengthy, complex, and highly uncertain. Consequently,\n\n\n\n\n     12\n      After Congress receives the statement listing the number of\nrepresentatives to which each state is entitled, \"[i]t shall be the\nduty of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, within fifteen\ncalendar days after the receipt of such statement, to send to the\nexecutive of each State a certificate of the number of\nRepresentatives to which such State is entitled.\"         2 U.S.C.\n§ 2a(b).\n\n                                    -25-\n\fhow Congress would react to a declaration is considerably more\n\nspeculative here than in Evans.13\n\n           A second case cited by Judge Torruella, Juda v. United\n\nStates,    13   Cl.   Ct.   667     (1987),   relates       more   directly    to\n\ninternational    agreements.        Juda    concerned   the    status    of   the\n\nMarshall Islands.      After World War II, the United States entered\n\ninto an agreement with the United Nations (UN) to administer the\n\nMarshall Islands as a UN trusteeship, in an arrangement designed to\n\nbe temporary. In the 1970s, the United States decided to terminate\n\nthe   trusteeship     and   offer   the    territory    a    compact    of    free\n\nassociation.    The compact agreement was submitted to a plebiscite,\n\nand was resoundingly approved.             Congress then enacted, and the\n\nPresident signed, legislation formally adopting the compact. After\n\nthe President issued an executive order implementing the compact,\n\nthe UN Trusteeship Council determined that the trusteeship had\n\nterminated.     See id. at 671-76.\n\n           Some years later, Marshall Islander plaintiffs filed a\n\nclaim against the United States under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1491,14 which had undisputedly applied to the Islands while they\n\nwere still under the trusteeship.              The United States argued,\n\n      13\n      Moreover, one of the two methods of redress contemplated --\nConstitutional amendment -- would require action not just by\nCongress, but also the legislatures of thirty-eight states. See\nU.S. Const. art. V.\n      14\n      The Tucker Act grants jurisdiction to the Court of Federal\nClaims (then known as the Claims Court) for claims against the\nUnited States, and provides the government's consent to such suits.\n\n                                     -26-\n\fhowever, that the compact agreement withdrew the government's\n\nwaiver of sovereign immunity.         See 13 Cl. Ct. at 677.              The\n\nplaintiffs   responded   that,    under   the   rules   applicable   to    UN\n\ntrusteeships, the trusteeship had not been validly terminated, and\n\ntherefore the compact -- which withdrew the government's consent to\n\nsuit -- never took effect.       See id. at 678.\n\n          The court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that failure\n\nto terminate the trusteeship properly meant that the compact (and\n\nwith it the withdrawal of consent to suit) had never taken effect.\n\nRather, the court found that whether \"the Trusteeship Agreement has\n\nnot been terminated de jure does not resolve the issue of whether\n\nthe Compact . . . is in effect.\"          Id. at 682.     Ultimately, the\n\ncourt concluded that the compact did take effect, and therefore\n\nthat the United States had withdrawn its consent to be sued.              See\n\nid. at 683, 690.   Thus, it dismissed the complaint.         Id. at 690.\n\n          Nevertheless, in a lengthy dictum, the court explained\n\nthat the trusteeship had in fact not been properly terminated. The\n\ncourt held that the trusteeship could not be formally terminated\n\nuntil the UN Security Council so voted.         See id. at 678-82.    Some\n\ntime after the Juda decision issued, the government took the\n\ncourt's advice and formally asked the Security Council to terminate\n\nthe trusteeship, which it did. See United Nations Security Council\n\nResolution 683 (Dec. 22, 1990).      That dictum, and the government's\n\n\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fdecision to take the court's advice, is the precedent upon which\n\nJudge Torruella relies.\n\n            Yet the Juda court did not \"declare\" anything -- it\n\ndismissed   the   plaintiffs'       complaint,   did   not    even   mention    a\n\ndeclaratory judgment, and is cited by Judge Torruella only for a\n\ndictum.    More importantly, in Juda there was no dispute that both\n\nCongress and the President intended to terminate the trusteeship;\n\nindeed, by enacting the compact and issuing an executive order\n\nimplementing it, the political branches thought they had done\n\nexactly that.     Juda noted that these actions did not have their\n\nintended    effect   due   to   a    technical    misunderstanding      of     UN\n\nprocedures, and explained how the elected branches could properly\n\nachieve what they had already sought to do.             The likelihood that\n\nCongress and the President would follow the court's advice was not\n\njust \"substantial,\" it was a near certainty.                 There is nothing\n\nremotely approaching such certainty here.15\n\n     15\n       A third case cited by Judge Torruella, Federal Election\nCommission v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), does not involve the\nlikelihood of action by Congress. Akins was a petition for review\nof an administrative agency's dismissal of an administrative\ncomplaint.    See id. at 18.      The agency's governing statute\nspecifically authorized judicial review of an agency's decision not\nto take certain action, see 2 U.S.C. § 437g(a)(8)(A), and provided\nthat the district court \"may declare that the dismissal of [a]\ncomplaint or the failure to act is contrary to law, and may direct\nthe Commission to conform with such declaration within 30 days,\"\nid. § 437g(a)(8)(C). Thus, Akins involved an administrative agency\nwhich Congress placed under unusually close judicial oversight,\neven extending to the agency's exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion, for which every declaration was potentially accompanied\nby a coercive order \"to conform with such declaration within 30\ndays.\"    We are not dealing in this case with a subordinate\n\n                                      -28-\n\f                                III.\n\n          There is no precedent for issuing a declaratory judgment\n\nin the circumstances of this case, and for good reason.          A\n\ndeclaratory judgment \"is a procedural device that provides a new,\n\nnoncoercive remedy . . . in cases involving an actual controversy\n\nthat has not reached the stage at which either party may seek a\n\ncoercive remedy . . . and in cases in which a party who could sue\n\nfor coercive relief has not yet done so.\"   B. Braun Med., Inc. v.\n\nAbbott Labs., 124 F.3d 1419, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (emphasis\n\nadded). Here, however, no coercive remedy would ever be available.\n\nCongress would be perfectly within its rights to ignore whatever a\n\nfederal court said.   The court's declaratory judgment would be, in\n\nessence, an advisory opinion.\n\n          As the Supreme Court explained in a different context:\n\n          In all civil litigation, the judicial decree\n          is not the end but the means. At the end of\n          the rainbow lies not a judgment, but some\n          action (or cessation of action) by the\n          defendant that the judgment produces -- the\n          payment   of   damages,  or   some   specific\n          performance, or the termination of some\n          conduct. Redress is sought through the court,\n          but from the defendant. This is no less true\n          of a declaratory judgment suit than of any\n\n\n\ngovernment agency, created by statute, with carefully crafted\nprovisions for substantive judicial review over the agency's\ndecision to do nothing. Rather, the party whose inaction Igartúa\ncomplains of is Congress itself, a coequal branch of government\nthat is Constitutionally free to ignore any potential declaration\nthat it should or must perform various actions entrusted to its\nsole discretion by the Constitution itself.    The redressability\nanalysis in Akins does not apply to this case.\n\n                                -29-\n\f          other action. The real value of the judicial\n          pronouncement -- what makes it a proper\n          judicial resolution of a \"case or controversy\"\n          rather than an advisory opinion -- is in the\n          settling of some dispute which affects the\n          behavior   of  the   defendant   towards   the\n          plaintiff.\n\nHewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 761 (1987) (describing test for\n\n\"prevailing party\" under 42 U.S.C. § 1988).    Here there is only\n\nhope and speculation that Congress, in response to a declaratory\n\njudgment about a violation of international law, would invoke\n\ncumbersome and contentious processes relating to Constitutional\n\namendments or the admission of a new state to eventually give\n\ncitizen residents of Puerto Rico the right to vote for President\n\nand Vice President. Such hope and speculation does not satisfy the\n\n\"case or controversy\" requirement of Article III.   On that basis\n\nalone, I would decline to exercise jurisdiction over Igartúa's\n\nrequest for declaratory relief.\n\n\n\n\n                              -30-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (dissenting).16      In its haste to\n\n\"put [plaintiffs-appellants'] constitutional claim fully at rest,\"17\n\nmaj. op. at 6, the majority has chosen to overlook the issues\n\nactually before this en banc court as framed by the order of the\n\nrehearing panel, see Igartúa de la Rosa v. United States, 404 F.3d\n\n1 (1st Cir. 2005) (order granting panel rehearing), which panel the\n\nen   banc   court   suppressed,   but    whose   order   was   adopted   as\n\nestablishing the    parameters of the issues to be decided by the en\n\nbanc court.   See Igartúa de la Rosa v. United States, 407 F.3d 30,\n\n31 (1st Cir. 2005) (converting to en banc review panel rehearing in\n\nwhich \"the parties [are] to address two issues:                first, the\n\nplaintiffs' claim that the United States was in default of its\n\ntreaty obligations and, second, the availability of declaratory\n\njudgment concerning the government's compliance with any such\n\n\n     16\n      I acknowledge the participation of amici, whose briefs\ncontributed to the clarification of various important issues. I\nregret that not all amici were granted the opportunity to express\nthemselves at oral argument.\n     17\n      Is this the constitutional equivalent of \"rest in peace\"?\nOf course, if Judge Lipez and Judge Campbell are correct that we\nlack jurisdiction to consider plaintiffs' claim, then the\nmajority's various conclusions on the merits would be mere dicta,\nlacking any precedential value. \"Without jurisdiction the court\ncannot proceed at all in any cause.     Jurisdiction is power to\ndeclare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function\nremaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and\ndismissing the cause.\" Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506, 514, 19\nL.Ed. 264 (1868) (quoted in Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 94-95 (1998)).      Furthermore, if the\nconcurring opinion is correct, the majority is issuing an advisory\nopinion of the same kind that Judge Lipez claims results from the\ndeclaratory judgment that I propose.\n\n                                  -31-\n\fobligations.\"). It is these issues that the parties were asked to\n\nbrief. Instead the majority has sidetracked this appeal into a dead\n\nend that is no longer before us:        Puerto Rico's lack of electoral\n\ncollege representation, see U.S. Const. art. II, § 1, cl. 2, and\n\nour lack of authority to order any constitutional change to such\n\nstatus by reason of that constitutional impediment.\n\n            In doing so, the majority fails to give any weight to the\n\nfundamental nature of the right to vote, and the legal consequences\n\nof this cardinal principal.       Under the combined guise of alleged\n\npolitical    question    doctrine,    its   admitted   desire   to   avoid\n\n\"embarrassment\" to the United States, and its pious lecturing on\n\nwhat it deems to be the nature of the judicial function, the\n\nmajority seeks to avoid what I believe is its paramount duty over\n\nand above these stated goals:     to do justice to the civil rights of\n\nthe four million United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe majority labels this duty with despect as \"rhetoric\" and\n\n\"intuitive values.\"       Maj. op. at 3.    I beg to differ, and so, I\n\nsuspect, do a considerable number of those four million U.S.\n\ncitizens who, lacking any political recourse, look to the courts of\n\nthe United States for succor because they are without any other\n\navenue of relief.       See United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304\n\nU.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938) (\"[P]rejudice against discrete and insular\n\nminorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to\n\ncurtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be\n\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\frelied    upon   to   protect   minorities   and   .   .   .   may   call   for\n\ncorrespondingly more searching judicial inquiry.\").18\n\n            Considering that justice and equity are the handmaidens\n\nof the law, I believe it is the duty of this court to exercise its\n\nequitable power under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2201(a),19 in its decision of the issues that are properly before\n\nthe en banc court, and to declare that the United States has failed\n\nto take any steps to meet obligations that are cognizable as the\n\nsupreme law of the land20 regarding plaintiffs-appellants' voting\n\nrights.    \"This is of the very essence of judicial duty.\"            Marbury\n\nv. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 178 (1803).\n\n            Because I believe that the majority fails to meet this\n\nduty, I respectfully dissent.\n\n     18\n       Reducing the majority and concurring opinions to their bare\nbones,    the   former  leaves    the  four   million    nationally\ndisenfranchised United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico to\nclaim their rights through a nonexistent political forum, while the\nlatter deny an existing judicial forum the authority to state the\nactuality of an undeniable fact. Both outcomes leave the citizens\nin question in an unjust legal limbo.\n     19\n      The Act states that \"[i]n a case of actual controversy within\nits jurisdiction, . . . any court of the United States, upon the\nfiling of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other\nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,\nwhether or not further relief is or could be sought.\" 28 U.S.C. §\n2201(a).\n     20\n       U.S. Const. art.

How did we come to this state of affairs?\n\n           On July 25, 1898, in the closing days of the Spanish-\n\nAmerican War, the United States invaded21 Puerto Rico.     At that\n\n\n      21\n       In what must be the height of euphemism, the majority refers\nto this turn of events as Puerto Rico's becoming \"associated\" with\nthe United States. Maj. op. at 4. A similar, but more pernicious,\nmischaracterization follows its description of the congressional\nenactments that authorized local self-government for Puerto Rico,\nwhich   the    majority  calls   an  \"agreement\"   for   a  \"unique\n'Commonwealth' status,\" id., and which the majority states resulted\nin the current \"negotiated relationship,\" id. at 9 (emphasis in\noriginal), between the U.S. and Puerto Rico.      Of course, these\nstatements are simply inaccurate and do not reflect the facts.\nThere is no room for doubt that Public Law 600, 64 Stat. 319 (1950)\n(codified at 48 U.S.C § 731b, et seq.) (authorizing Puerto Rico to\nenact a constitution for local self-government), and its sequel,\nPublic Law 447, 66 Stat. 327 (1952) (resolution approving Puerto\nRico's Constitution), did nothing to change the underlying\nconstitutional status of Puerto Rico as an unincorporated\nterritory, subordinated to Congress' plenary powers under the\nTerritorial Clause, U.S. Const., Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. See generally\nDavid M. Helfeld, The Historical Prelude to the Constitution of the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico, 21 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 135 (1952); David\nM. Helfeld, Congressional Intent and Attitude Toward Public Law 600\nand The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 21 Rev.\nJur. 255 (1952) (containing numerous citations to the Congressional\nrecord and reports indicating that these measures did not change\nPuerto Rico's basic status under the Constitution nor Congress'\npowers    over    this  unincorporated   territory);   Keith   Bea,\nCongressional Research Service, Political Status of Puerto Rico:\nBackground, Options, and Issues in the 109th Congress, at CRS-2\n(updated Jun. 6, 2005) (\"While the approval of the commonwealth\nconstitution marked a historic change in the civil government for\nthe islands, neither it, nor the public laws approved by Congress\nin 1950 and 1952, revoked statutory provisions concerning the legal\nrelationship of Puerto Rico to the United States.              This\nrelationship is based on the Territorial Clause of the U.S.\nConstitution.\"). It is not just the majority's inaccuracies in\ndescribing the colonial relationship between Puerto Rico and the\nUnited States to which I object. The majority's unfortunate choice\nof language obviously favors the colonial condition and this bias\nwill, without any question or doubt, be exploited politically.\n\n                               -34-\n\fpoint in time the inhabitants of Puerto Rico had full rights as\n\nSpanish       citizens.      This   included      the   right   to    elect   sixteen\n\ndeputies and three senators, with full voting rights, to the\n\nSpanish Cortes (Parliament).22             Fernando Bayrón Toro, Elecciones y\n\npartidos de Puerto Rico 108 (2003). Furthermore, Puerto Ricans had\n\nrecently been granted a high measure of self-government.                         See\n\ngenerally Autonomic Charter of 1897, reproduced at, Documents on\n\nthe Constitutional Relationship of Puerto Rico and the United\n\nStates 22-46 (Marcos Ramirez Lavandero, ed., 1948).\n\n                  All this came to naught with the signing of the Treaty of\n\nParis        on   December   10,   1898,    which   officially       concluded   this\n\n\"splendid little war\"23 and ended four hundred years of Spanish\n\n\n     The debate over what status Puerto Rico ought to have with\nrespect to the United States is, of course, hotly contested. What\nthat status should be is not the issue before us. The only issue\nis whether the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico should have the right\nto vote nationally.    The right to vote will benefit all U.S.\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico regardless of their position on\nstatus, since it will give them a meaningful political voice until\nthat issue is resolved, and on that issue itself.\n     22\n      In fact, Puerto Rico had been represented in the Spanish\nCortes as early as 1812, see Constitución politica de la Monarquía\nEspañola (promulgated in Cadiz on Mar. 18, 1812), as a result of\nwhich its one deputy, Ramón Powers, became Vice President of the\nCortes in 1812. Thereafter, depending on the vagaries of Spanish\npolitics, constitutions, and special laws enacted to apply to\nSpain's overseas provinces and colonies, Puerto Rico was variously\nrepresented in the Cortes.\n        23\n       John Hay, U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain in 1898, and a\nleading expansionist of the time, wrote to then Colonel Theodore\nRoosevelt, at the time of only Rough Rider fame, \"[i]t has been a\nsplendid little war; begun with the highest motives, carried on\nwith magnificent intelligence and spirit, favored by that fortune\nwhich loves the brave.\" Frank Freidel, The Splendid Little War 3\n\n                                           -35-\n\fcolonial rule.       See Treaty of Peace between the United States of\n\nAmerica and the Kingdom of Spain, Dec. 10, 1898, U.S.-Spain, 30\n\nStat. 1754.      Thus commenced, in its place, a new period of\n\ncolonialism which has so far lasted one hundred and seven years.24\n\nNotwithstanding Puerto Ricans' loss of these major political grants\n\nfrom Spain, the transition to United States sovereignty was largely\n\nseamless.25    This was at least partially due to the fact that\n\nSpanish rule had been less than kind,26 but more importantly,\n\nbecause   of   the   prospect   of   joining    a   democratic    nation   that\n\npromised the Puerto Rican people that it had come to \"bestow upon\n\n[Puerto Ricans] the immunities and blessings of [the] liberal\n\ninstitutions of our government.\"            Letter of Nelson Miles, Major-\n\nGeneral Commanding the U.S. Army to the Inhabitants of Porto Rico\n\n(Nov. 5, 1898) in Annual Reports of the War Department for the\n\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 1900 19-20 (1902).

Treaty of Peace, art. IX, para. 2, 30 Stat. 1754, 1759.\n\nThus, for the first time in American history, the United States\n\nacquired territory without ipso facto granting its inhabitants\n\ncitizenship,27 and therefore, also contrary to its founding history,\n\nthe United States became a colonial nation.       See Julius William\n\nPratt, America's Colonial Experiment 68 (1950).    Immediately after\n\nthe invasion, Puerto Rico settled into a military government that\n\nlasted until 1900, when Congress enacted the so-called Foraker Act.\n\nForaker Act, ch. 191, 31 Stat. 77 (1900) (codified as amended in\n\nscattered sections of 48 U.S.C.). This statute established a civil\n\ngovernment composed almost totally of officials appointed by the\n\nPresident.   A local legislature was provided, but only its lower\n\nhouse was elected by Puerto Rican residents.

This incorrect spelling was thereafter used in the Foraker\nAct in 1900, after which it took thirty-two years to persuade\nCongress that \"Porto\" is Portuguese and that the correct Spanish\nname should be restored.

He concluded that:\n\n          A false step at this time might be fatal to\n          what Chief Justice Marshall called the\n          American Empire . . . . If those possessions\n          are inhabited by alien races, differing from\n          us in religion, customs, laws, methods of\n          taxation,   and   modes    of   thought,   the\n          administration of government and justice,\n          according to Anglo-Saxon principles, may for a\n          time be impossible; and the question at once\n          arises whether large concessions ought not to\n          be made for a time, that ultimately our own\n          theories may be carried out . . . .         We\n          decline to hold that there is anything in the\n          Constitution to forbid such action.     We are\n          therefore of the opinion that the Island of\n          Porto Rico is a territory appurtenant and\n          belonging to the United States, but not a part\n          of the United States within the revenue\n          clauses of the Constitution . . . .\n\nId. at 286-87.\n\n\n\n\n                               -42-\n\f           Justice   White's   concurrence    in    Downes     provided   the\n\ncentral support for the seminal \"unincorporated territory\" doctrine\n\nfor which the Insular Cases have become known.                 This doctrine\n\nstates that in the case of unincorporated territories -- that is,\n\nthose for which, at the time of acquisition, the United States did\n\nnot express an intention of incorporating into the Union -- only\n\nthose parts of the Constitution dealing with \"fundamental\" rights\n\napply.     See   Coudert,   supra,   note    32,    at   832    (relating    a\n\nconversation with Justice White in which it was \"evident that he\n\nwas much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions\n\nof a very perplexing character and that he was quite as desirous as\n\nJustice Brown that Congress should have a very free hand in dealing\n\nwith the new subject populations\").\n\n           Chief Justice Fuller's dissent, which was joined by\n\nJustices Harlan, Brewer and Peckham, and thus gathered the most\n\nvotes, followed a strict construction of the Constitution.                  It\n\nrejected   the   plurality's   conclusion    as    inconsistent    with     the\n\nConstitution, because it\n\n           assumes that the Constitution created a\n           government empowered to acquire countries\n           throughout the world, to be governed by\n           different rules than those obtaining in the\n           original    states   and   territories,   and\n           substitutes   for   the  present   system  of\n           republican government a system of domination\n           over distant provinces in the exercise of\n           unrestricted power.\n\nDownes, 182 U.S. at 373 (Fuller, C.J., dissenting).\n\n\n\n                                  -43-\n\f            Justice Harlan's dissent was equally forceful in pointing\n\nout that:\n\n            Still less is it true that Congress can deal\n            with new territories just as other nations\n            have done or may do with their new territories\n            . . . . Monarchical and despotic governments,\n            unrestrained by written constitutions, may do\n            with newly acquired territories what this\n            government may not do consistently with our\n            fundamental law.     To say otherwise is to\n            concede that Congress may, by action taken\n            outside of the Constitution, engraft upon our\n            republican institutions a colonial system such\n            as exists under monarchical governments.\n            Surely such a result was never contemplated by\n            the fathers of the Constitution . . . . The\n            idea that this country may acquire territories\n            anywhere upon the earth, by conquest or\n            treaty, and hold them as mere colonies or\n            provinces,--the people inhabiting them to\n            enjoy only such rights as Congress chooses to\n            accord to them,-- is wholly inconsistent with\n            the spirit and genius, as well as with the\n            words, of the Constitution.\n\nId. at 380.    Justice Harlan went on to say, in part to answer the\n\nracial overtones of the plurality, that:\n\n            Whether a particular race will or will not\n            assimilate with our people, and whether they\n            can or cannot with safety to our institutions\n            be brought within the operation of the\n            Constitution, is a matter to be thought of\n            when it is proposed to acquire their territory\n            by treaty.    A mistake in the acquisition of\n            territory, although such acquisition seemed at\n            the time to be necessary, cannot be made the\n            ground for violating the Constitution or\n            refusing   to    give  full  effect   to   its\n            provisions.    The Constitution is not to be\n            obeyed or disobeyed as the circumstances of a\n            particular crisis in our history may suggest\n            the one or the other course to be pursued . .\n\n                                 -44-\n\f             . .   The Constitution is supreme over every\n             foot of territory, wherever situated, under\n             the jurisdiction of the United States, and its\n             full operation cannot be stayed by any branch\n             of the government in order to meet what some\n             may suppose to be extraordinary emergencies.\n             If the Constitution is in force in any\n             territory, it is in force there for every\n             purpose embraced by the objects for which the\n             government was ordained.\n\nId. at 384-85.\n\n             Although decided by an exiguous plurality of five votes\n\nto four, and based on dubious constitutional foundations, the\n\nInsular Cases became an article of faith in American constitutional\n\ndogma, with far-reaching consequences on the lives of the millions\n\nof persons whom they impacted in very fundamental ways.                 See\n\nTorruella, supra note 30, at 117-266.\n\nB.   United States citizenship for the residents of Puerto Rico\n\n             In the aftermath of the Insular Cases, the United States\n\nsettled into the business of governing its far-flung colonial\n\nempire and emerged from its isolationist cocoon into the world of\n\npower politics.       See generally Foster Dulles, America's Rise to\n\nWorld Power, 1898-1954 (1955).          In the meantime, between 1901 and\n\n1917, a total of twenty one bills were presented in Congress\n\nproposing     the   grant   of   U.S.    citizenship   to   Puerto   Rico's\n\ninhabitants.34      During this interregnum between the Insular Cases\n\nand the 1917 passage of the Jones Act, ch. 145, 39 Stat. 951 (1917)\n\n\n\n      34\n           For a full account see Cabranes, supra note 29.\n\n                                    -45-\n\f-- which granted U.S. citizenship to the residents of Puerto Rico,\n\nid. § 5 -- the Supreme Court decided Rassmussen v. United States,\n\n197 U.S. 516 (1905).   Rassmussen provides an important backdrop to\n\nthe grant of citizenship to Puerto Ricans because in it, the\n\nSupreme Court seemed to link the incorporation of a territory into\n\nthe United States (and thus full application of the Constitution)\n\nto the granting of citizenship to the inhabitants of a territory.\n\nSee id. at 522 (finding grant of citizenship to residents of newly\n\nacquired territory of Alaska served \"to express the purpose to\n\nincorporate acquired territory into the United States.\").\n\n          There was therefore great expectation in Puerto Rico when\n\nCongress passed the Jones Act in 1917, which, in addition to\n\nproviding Puerto Ricans with an elected bicameral legislature,\n\ngranted U.S. citizenship to the residents of Puerto Rico.35   These\n\nhopes were soon deflated by the Supreme Court in Balzac v. Porto\n\nRico, 258 U.S. 298 (1922), in which Chief Justice William Howard\n\nTaft,36 at this point writing for a unanimous court, held that no\n\n     35\n        For an in-depth account of the events leading up to the\npassage of the Jones Act, particularly the acrimonious debates that\npreceded its passage, see Cabranes, supra note 29, at 471-85.\n     36\n       Chief Justice Taft who, of course, had been President of the\nUnited States from 1909 to 1912, had a long and somewhat fractious\nexperience with the United States' newly acquired colonies. He did\nnot need to be influenced by academics on questions of expansionism\nor how to deal with the colonies. In 1900, he became the first\ncivilian governor of the Philippine Islands at a time when the\nAguinaldo Insurrection -- a war that led to thousands of U.S.\ncasualties and over 100,000 civilian deaths, many more than in the\nentire Spanish-American War -- was in full swing. See generally\nBrian McAllister Linn, The Philippine War, 1899-1902 (2000). In\n\n                                -46-\n\fright to trial by jury attached to Balzac's new status as a U.S.\n\ncitizen because, even after the Jones Act, Puerto Rico remained an\n\nunincorporated territory with only \"fundamental rights\" under the\n\nConstitution applying.     The right to trial by jury was not, the\n\nCourt reaffirmed, \"a fundamental right.\"          Id. at 309-10 (quoting\n\nDorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138, 148 (1904).

In   language    reminiscent   of     the   racially-tinged\n\nasseverations of Justice Brown in Downes, Chief Justice Taft went\n\non to say:\n\n\n\n1904, while Secretary of War under President Theodore Roosevelt,\nTaft oversaw not only the Philippines, but also Cuba and Puerto\nRico. In 1906, he was sent to Cuba as its provisional governor\nunder the Platt Amendment to the Cuban Constitution, which allowed\nthe United States to intervene in Cuban affairs during times of\n\"unrest.\" However, it was during his time as President that Taft\nbecame openly disenchanted with Puerto Rico and its inhabitants as\na result of the so-called Budget Crisis of 1909. See Truman R.\nClark, President Taft and the Puerto Rican Appropriations Crisis of\n1909, 26 The Americas 152-70 (1969).        President Taft accused\nPuerto Rico's elected leaders of irresponsibility and political\nimmaturity, and suggested that too much power had been given to\nPuerto Ricans \"for their own good.\" Message from President Taft to\nCongress, S.

This was one of the chief grounds\n              [for the holding in Rasmussen] . . . . But\n              Alaska was a very different case from that of\n              Porto Rico.

It was on the American\n              continent and within easy reach of the then\n              United States.

Unfortunately, it is one which has been repeated\n\nsince Balzac was decided. See Califano v. Gautier Torres, 435 U.S.\n\n\n                                     -48-\n\f1 (1978) (upholding Social Security Act provisions denying benefits\n\nto U.S. citizens who move to Puerto Rico); Harris v. Rosario, 446\n\nU.S. 651 (1980) (upholding statute providing less federal financial\n\nassistance to Puerto Rico than other states to aid families with\n\ndependent children).\n\n              The Court's rulings in Kinsella v. Krueger, 351 U.S. 470\n\n(1956), reh'd granted 352 U.S. 901 (1956), and Reid v. Covert, 351\n\nU.S. 487 (1956), reh'd granted, 352 U.S. 901 (1956), illustrate\n\nthis point even more clearly.           Although, in denying Puerto Ricans\n\nthe   right    to   trial   by   jury    in    Balzac,    Chief   Justice   Taft\n\nunequivocally stated that \"[i]t is locality that is determinative\n\nof the application of the Constitution in such matters as judicial\n\nprocedure, and not the status of the people who live in it,\" 258\n\nU.S. at 309, the Supreme Court nevertheless chose to overlook this\n\nrule when deciding Kinsella and Reid in the aftermath of the Second\n\nWorld War.\n\n              Both cases involved challenges to the application of the\n\nUniform Code of Military Justice to women who were tried, convicted\n\nand sentenced by court martial for murdering their serviceman\n\nhusbands, one in Japan (Kinsella), and the other in England (Reid).\n\nNeither had the benefit of indictment by grand jury or trial before\n\na petit jury. On the first round, the Court, relying on Balzac,\n\naffirmed the validity of both convictions.               Kinsella, 351 U.S. at\n\n\n\n\n                                        -49-\n\f474-80;   Reid,   351    U.S.   at   490-91       (relying    on    Kinsella    as\n\nestablishing validity of military jurisdiction).\n\n           This outcome was followed by much public stirring, an\n\nunsurprising   result,    considering       the   number     of    civilian   U.S.\n\ncitizens who were then attached to the military overseas.                      The\n\npublic outcry undoubtedly contributed to their being reheard almost\n\nimmediately, early in the Court's next term.\n\n           The plurality opinion, reversing the prior outcome, was\n\nwritten by Justice Black. He announced that the reliance placed on\n\nthe Insular Cases in the first Kinsella opinion was \"misplaced.\"\n\nReid v. Covert, 354 U.S. 1, 13 (1957).            In language reminiscent of\n\nJustice Harlan's dissents in the Insular Cases, Justice Black\n\nstated:\n\n           The 'Insular Cases' can be distinguished from\n           the present cases in that they involved the\n           power of Congress to provide rules and\n           regulations to govern temporarily territories\n           with   wholly   dissimilar    traditions   and\n           institutions whereas here the basis for\n           governmental power is American citizenship . .\n           . . The concept that the Bill of Rights and\n           other   constitutional   protections   against\n           arbitrary government are inoperative when they\n           become   inconvenient   or   when   expediency\n           dictates otherwise is a very dangerous\n           doctrine and if allowed to flourish would\n           destroy the benefit of a written Constitution\n           and undermine the basis of our government.\n\nId. at 14 (emphasis added).\n\n           The new outcome in Kinsella and Reid, as well as the\n\nreversal of Plessy by Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483\n\n\n\n                                     -50-\n\f(1954), accentuate the realpolitik of the civil and political\n\nrights of the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico, for\n\nit is because of the democratic deficit in the Puerto Rico-United\n\nStates relationship that Puerto Rico enters its second century of\n\nits    colonial   condition     with    the     United    States     without   any\n\nresolution of this conundrum in sight.37             Stagnation is inevitable,\n\nfor there is a political vacuum in the Puerto Rico-United States\n\nlinkage.     No effective political pressure can be exercised by the\n\nsubjects of this colonial relationship on the national political\n\ninstitutions with power to solve the problem.                   It is precisely\n\nbecause this discrete population of United States citizens is kept\n\nin a voteless state by the national political institutions that\n\nhave \"plenary powers\" over Puerto Rico that a \"political solution\"\n\nis not a realistic option.       The opinion of U.S. voters affected by\n\nKinsella and Reid could be heard and felt in Washington, as could\n\nthat    of   African-Americans    after       Plessy,    even   if   they   were   a\n\nnumerical     minority,    because     they    had   a   significant    political\n\npresence that was bound to be listened to sooner or later.                   There\n\ncan be little doubt that this political clout was transformed into\n\na judicial result.        Cf. supra note 31.         Not so with Puerto Rico's\n\nU.S. citizens.      They have no effective way of influencing the\n\n\n       37\n      The debate over what status Puerto Rico ought to have with\nrespect to the United States is, of course, hotly contested. The\nright to vote will benefit all U.S. citizens residing in Puerto\nRico, regardless of their position on status since it will give\nthem a meaningful political voice until that issue is resolved.\n\n                                       -51-\n\fpolitical branches of the national government.               Puerto Rico's lone\n\nnon-voting representative in Congress is a prime example of Puerto\n\nRico's political defenselessness.             The political pressure that can\n\nbe exercised by those who took Chief Justice Taft's advice, and\n\nmoved to the Mainland, is so diluted in the general population of\n\nthe United States as to make any political pressure by them\n\nexiguous.\n\n            This total lack of political power is a fact that is\n\nglossed over by the majority when it righteously dictates that\n\nPuerto    Ricans'    \"right      to    vote   in    presidential    elections   is\n\nfundamentally a political [issue] and must be [achieved] through\n\npolitical means.\"          Maj. op. at 13.         To what \"political means\" is\n\nthe majority referring?           Political means are precisely what the\n\nU.S. citizens of Puerto Rico lack, and cannot create out of thin\n\nair as if by alchemy.\n\n            Not     only    do   the    national      political    branches   lack\n\nincentive to act, but, as illustrated by the majority's views,38\n\n     38\n      Although I place Judge Lipez's concurrence in a separate\ncategory, I disagree with his conclusion that we lack jurisdiction\nto declare the Congress has failed to take any action to comply\nwith its international obligations.      This failure affects the\n\"rights and legal relations of an interested party,\" the U.S.\ncitizens in question, \"whether or not further relief is or could be\nsought.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a). There is nothing hypothetical about\nplaintiffs' national disenfranchisement. We have the authority to\nacknowledge that condition, and Congress' failure to take any\naction to correct it despite having committed, under binding\ninternational law, to do so. Judge Lipez misstates the issues as\nframed by my dissent when he focuses on Congress' failure \"to\neither admit[] Puerto Rico as a state or propose[] . . . [a\nconstitutional] amendment.\" Supra at 21 (Lipez, J., concurring).\n\n                                         -52-\n\fthis disincentive has also been manifested in the Third Branch,\n\nwhich, if the truth be told, laid the groundwork for this state of\n\naffairs with its decisions in the Insular Cases and Balzac, and\n\ncontinues to perpetuate the inherent inequalities thus created.\n\n              The    Supreme   Court    therefore       has   every    reason    to\n\nreconsider the Insular Cases and Balzac.                They are the product of\n\nan era which is a blot on our national and judicial history.                    The\n\nbasis upon which they were premised -- that the United States could\n\nhold territories and their inhabitants in a colonial status ad\n\ninfinitum      --     was    unprecedented       and    unauthorized     by     the\n\nConstitution.        The interpretation given by the Insular Cases and\n\nBalzac   to    the    Constitution     permits    the    perpetuation,    without\n\nlimitation, of a class of citizens unequal in rights to the rest of\n\nthe body politic, an anachronism that is unsupportable morally,\n\nlogically or legally.\n\n              Furthermore, the underpinnings to this doctrine have\n\nsince been eroded.          If there ever were a justification for their\n\noutcome based on the expediency of the historical epoch during\n\nwhich they were decided, this justification can no longer be\n\nsustained. Since the Insular Cases and Balzac were decided, Plessy\n\n\n\nAlthough those are among the remedial options available, it makes\nno difference whether it be these or other alternatives that\nCongress adopts. The only unavailable option is to do nothing,\nbecause that is a violation of an international pledge which has\nbecome United States law. Failure to act has legal consequences\nthat create a case and controversy legally cognizable by a\ndeclaratory judgment even if relief is not available.\n\n                                       -53-\n\fhas been reversed by Brown, making racial discrimination legally\n\nand   ethically    unacceptable.        Discrimination    on   the   basis    of\n\nlocality makes as much sense as such opprobrious conduct based on\n\nrace.   Moreover, the idea, expressed in Balzac, that the right to\n\ntrial by jury is not a fundamental constitutional right is no\n\nlonger the law of the land.       See Duncan, 391 U.S. at 154.       Balzac's\n\nruling has therefore ceased to be the law of the land.\n\n           Puerto Rico is part of the First Circuit. An Article III\n\nDistrict Court sits there, providing nearly one-third of the\n\nappeals filed before this court, which sits in Puerto Rico at least\n\ntwice a year, also in the exercise of Article III power.                     One\n\nactive judge of this court resides in Puerto Rico and participates\n\nin cases that are often of national importance, but is nonetheless\n\ndisenfranchised from voting for national offices.                How can the\n\nConstitution      be   applied   in   such   a   Balkanized,   arbitrary     and\n\nirrational manner?        See Downes, 182 U.S. at 374 (Fuller, C.J.,\n\ndissenting) (\"[T]he language of the Constitution is too plain and\n\nunambiguous to permit its meaning to be thus influenced.\").\n\n           The proposition that Puerto Rico \"belong[s] to . . . but\n\n[is] not a part of the United States,\" Downes, 181 U.S. at 287,\n\nlike the \"separate but equal\" concept endorsed in Plessy, belongs\n\nto the Dark Ages of American constitutional law and should be\n\nrelegated to a period in our history best forgotten.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\f                                II.\n\nA.   The right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right\n\n           The right to vote is a fundamental right, which our\n\nConstitution guarantees to all citizens.   See, e.g., Bush v. Gore,\n\n531 U.S. 98, 104 (2000); Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 198\n\n(1992); Tashjian v. Republican Party, 479 U.S. 208 (1986); Buckley\n\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 49 n.55 (1976); Lubin v. Panish, 415 U.S.\n\n709, 721 (1974); Bullock v. Carter, 405 U.S. 134 (1972); Phoenix v.\n\nKolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204 (1970); Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of\n\nElections, 383 U.S. 663, 667 (1966); Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S.\n\n533, 561-562 (1964); Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1, 7 (1964).\n\n           No right is more precious in a free country\n           than that of having a voice in the election of\n           those who make the laws under which, as good\n           citizens, we must live.    Other rights, even\n           the most basic, are illusory if the right to\n           vote is undermined. Our Constitution leaves no\n           room for classification of people in a way\n           that unnecessarily abridges this right.\n\nWesberry, 376 U.S. at 17-18. \"[H]istory has seen a continuing\n\nexpansion of the scope of the right of suffrage in this country.\n\nThe right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of\n\nthe essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that\n\nright strike at the heart of representative government.\"    Reynolds\n\nv. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964) (footnote omitted).\n\n           Fundamental voting rights protections should apply fully\n\nto U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico. Even under the notorious\n\nInsular Cases, it has been held that the Constitution extends\n\n                               -55-\n\ffundamental rights to Puerto Rico. See Balzac, 258 U.S. at 312-13.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment is fully applicable to the actions of the U.S.\n\ngovernment in Puerto Rico.               Cf. Examining Bd. of Engineers v.\n\nFlores de Otero, 426 U.S. 572 (1976).               Although not identical to\n\nthat of the Fourteenth Amendment, an equal protection component is\n\npart of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and serves\n\nto constrain the United States.             See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S.\n\n497, 498-99 (1954) (holding that despite lack of explicit equal\n\nprotection clause, \"discrimination may be so unjustifiable as to be\n\nviolative of due process\"). The utter failure of the government of\n\nthe United States to take any action to protect its citizens in\n\nPuerto   Rico    from    continued       national   disenfranchisement          is    a\n\nviolation of due process and equal protection under the Fifth\n\nAmendment of the Constitution.\n\nB.   International law\n\n            In   addition    to    the    right   to   vote      enshrined     in    its\n\nConstitution, the United States is also bound, both domestically\n\nand internationally, by guarantees of voting rights found in\n\ninternational     law.      Historically        referred    to    as   \"the    law   of\n\nnations,\"   international         law    incorporates      both   treaty      law    and\n\ncustomary   international         law.     Restatement      (Third)     of    Foreign\n\nRelations Law of the United States § 102 (2004) (\"Restatement\").\n\nThus conceived, international law has been an integral part of our\n\nconstitutional and legal system since the founding of our Nation.\n\n\n                                         -56-\n\fSee Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 2764 (2004) (\"For two\n\ncenturies we have affirmed that the domestic law of the United\n\nStates recognizes the law of nations.\"); The Paquete Habana, 175\n\nU.S. 677, 700 (1900) (\"International law is part of our law, and\n\nmust be ascertained and administered by the courts of justice of\n\nappropriate jurisdiction, as often as questions of right depending\n\nupon it are duly presented for their determination.\"); The Nereide,\n\n13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815) (\"[T]he Court is bound by the\n\nlaw of nations which is part of the law of the land.\").         The\n\nimportance placed on international law, from the founding of the\n\nUnited States, as a component of the nation's legal system is\n\nevident in its Constitution, which authorized Congress \"[t]o define\n\nand punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and\n\nOffenses against the Law of Nations,\" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl.\n\n10, granted the President the power, \"by and with the Advice and\n\nConsent of the Senate, to make Treaties,\" id. art. II, § 2, cl. 2,\n\nand extended the Article III authority of the federal judiciary to\n\n\"all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the\n\nLaws of the United States,39 and Treaties made, or which shall be\n\nmade,\" id. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.      It also provided that \"[t]his\n\nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made\n\n     39\n      Customary international law is part of the \"Law[] of the\nUnited States\" within the meaning of Article III.

VI, cl. 2.     In light of\n\nthe historical significance of international law, the Supreme Court\n\nhas recently recognized that \"[i]t would take some explaining to\n\nsay now that federal courts must avert their gaze entirely from any\n\ninternational norm intended to protect individuals.\" Sosa, 124\n\nS.Ct. at 2764-65.\n\n           We look to the treaties and conventions to which the\n\nUnited States is a party, both to determine whether they impose a\n\ndirect   obligation   on   the   United     States   that   is   relevant   to\n\nplaintiffs-appellants' claims, and, in combination with widely-\n\nobserved legal norms and practices among the nations of the world\n\ntoday, as evidence of binding customary international law that\n\nwould support plaintiffs-appellants' claims. See Restatement § 102\n\n(identifying sources of customary international law); see also id.\n\n§ 103 (identifying secondary evidence of international law).\n\n           The   United     States     has    participated       in   several\n\ninternational instruments relevant to the issue before us: (1) the\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (\"UDHR\") G.A.

Coincidentally,\n\nthis occurred at a Special General Assembly of the Organization of\n\nthe American States meeting in Lima, Peru on the fateful day of\n\nSeptember 11, 2001. The importance of this agreement to the United\n\nStates can be gauged by what took place there and by the actions of\n\nSecretary of State Collin Powell, who headed the U.S. delegation at\n\nthat meeting. After thanking the gathered delegates for their\n\nexpressions of solidarity and condolences for the terrorist attacks\n\nthat had occurred that day against the United States homeland, the\n\nSecretary stated:\n\n          It is important that I remain here for a bit\n          longer in order to be part of the consensus of\n          this new charter on democracy.

I hope we can\n          move the order of business to the adoption of\n          the Charter because I very much want to\n          express the United States' commitment to\n          democracy in this hemisphere . . . .

Thereafter,\n\nthe Special Assembly adopted the IADC, which among other relevant\n\nprovisions states:\n\n\n\n\n                               -61-\n\f           Article 2\n\n           The effective exercise of representative\n           democracy is the basis for the rule of law and\n           constitutional regimes of the member states\n\n           . . . .\n\n           Article 3\n\n           Essential elements of representative democracy\n           include, inter alia . . . the holding of\n           periodic, and fair elections based on secret\n           balloting and universal suffrage as an\n           expression of the sovereignty of the people\n\n           . . . .\n\n           Article 6\n\n           It is the right    and responsibility of all\n           citizens to participate in decisions relating\n           to their own development. This is also a\n           necessary condition for the full and effective\n           exercise of democracy . . . .\n\n           Prior to the approval of the IADC, however, the United\n\nStates had already entered into another international agreement\n\nwhose provisions are of singular importance to the issue before us.\n\nBy virtue of the ICCPR, which came into force on March 23, 1976,\n\nand was ratified by the Senate on April 12, 1992, see 138 Cong.\n\nRec. S4781, S4783, the United States committed, in clear and\n\nunambiguous terms, that \"[e]very citizen shall have the right and\n\nthe opportunity . . . [t]o vote . . . at genuine periodic elections\n\nwhich shall be by universal and equal suffrage . . . .\" ICCPR art.\n\n25.   Furthermore, in ratifying Article 2, Paragraph 1, the United\n\nStates agreed that it would \"undertake[] to respect and to ensure\n\n\n\n                               -62-\n\fto   all   individuals   within   its   territory   and   subject   to   its\n\njurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant . . .\n\nwithout distinction of any kind . . . .\"            Most important, and\n\ncentral to the issue before us, the signatory nations committed\n\nthemselves that:\n\n            [W]here not already provided for by existing\n            legislati[on] . . . each State Party . . .\n            undertakes to take necessary steps, in\n            accordance with its constitutional processes\n            and with the provisions of the present\n            Covenant, to adopt such legislation or other\n            measures as may be necessary to give effect to\n            the rights recognized in the present Covenant.\n\nId. art. 2, para. 2 (emphasis added).41\n\n            We turn now to an examination of the United States'\n\nobligations under these international instruments and the customary\n\ninternational law to which they contribute.\n\n            1.   Treaty obligations\n\n            By 1992, 103 nations had become parties to the ICCPR,\n\nwith another five, including the United States, having signed.            On\n\nApril, 12, 1992, as required by the Constitution, two-thirds of the\n\nUnited States Senate voted in favor of ratifying the ICCPR.              138\n\n\n\n      41\n      The United States further agreed to an enforcement mechanism\nfor the realization and security of the rights established in the\nICCPR. Each State Party undertook \"[t]o ensure that any person\nwhose [ICCPR] rights or freedoms . . . are violated shall have an\neffective remedy,\" to ensure that these rights would be \"determined\nby competent judicial, administrative or legislative authorities,\nor by any competent authority provided for by the legal system of\nthe State,\" and that \"the possibilities of judicial remedy\" would\nbe developed. Id. art. 2, para. 3 (emphasis added).\n\n                                   -63-\n\fCong. Rec. S4781, S4783.       Under Article VI, Clause 2 of the\n\nConstitution, a treaty thus ratified has equal status to an act of\n\nCongress.    That is, a treaty is law of the United States.         See,\n\ne.g., Jordan J. Paust, International Law as Law of the United\n\nStates 99-105, 120 (2d ed. 2002).   As with statutes, a later treaty\n\nsupercedes   inconsistent   earlier-enacted   statute,   provided    the\n\ntreaty provision on the subject is self-executing.         Whitney v.\n\nRobertson, 124 U.S. 190, 194 (1888).\n\n            When it ratified the ICCPR, however, the Senate also\n\nissued a declaration to the effect that the substantive provisions\n\nof the ICCPR would not be self-executing.42       138 Cong. Rec. at\n\n     42\n        The Senate also made actual reservations under which its\nobligations to comply with various provisions of the ICCPR were\nlimited. See 138 Cong. Rec. S4781, S4783 (stating, inter alia,\nthat the United States will not take any steps to comply with ICCPR\nArticle 20 that would infringe on the right of free speech and\nassociation; reiterating the applicability of capital punishment\nfor adults and minors; deeming ICCPR Article 7 prohibitions on\n\"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" to apply only\nto   treatment   deemed   \"cruel   and  unusual\"   under   domestic\nconstitutional law; declining to adhere to ICCPR Article 15,\nParagraph 1; and reserving the right to treat juveniles, under\ncertain circumstances, as adults, notwithstanding the provisions\nof ICCPR Article 10, Paragraphs 2(b) and 3, and Article 14,\nParagraph 4).\n     In contrast, no reservations or other limitations to the\nspecific obligations contained in Article 25 were made, aside from\nthe declaration of non-self-execution applicable to all substantive\narticles of the ICCPR. Id.     This is indicative of the Senate's\nintent to accept the obligation of full compliance with that\nprovision of the ICCPR.      See also id. at S4784 (adding the\nUnderstanding \"[t]hat the United States understands that this\nCovenant shall be implemented by the Federal Government to the\nextent that it exercises legislative and judicial jurisdiction over\nthe matters covered therein, and otherwise by the state and local\ngovernments,\" and that \"the Federal Government shall take measures\nappropriate to the Federal system\" to ensure that \"state or local\n\n                                -64-\n\fS4784.     I wholeheartedly agree with Judge Howard's conclusion that\n\nthis declaration is not binding on this court, and that further\n\ninquiry to determine whether the ICCPR is indeed non-self-executing\n\nis required.     See infra at 89 (Howard, J., dissenting).        I will not\n\nattempt to restate his sound reasoning here. However, even if this\n\napproach is not accepted, this court is not, as explained below,\n\nentirely without power to act.\n\n             If the ICCPR were not self-executing, the treaty, qua\n\ntreaty, could not be invoked by a private citizen as the basis for\n\na   court   of   the   United   States   to   order   that   citizen's   full\n\nparticipation in the electoral processes of the United States. See\n\nSosa, 124 S. Ct. at 2767 (recognizing the internationally-binding\n\nnature of the ICCPR, but observing that \"the United States ratified\n\nthe Covenant on the express understanding that it was not self-\n\nexecuting and so did not itself create obligations enforceable in\n\nthe federal courts\").43 That is, a court of the United States could\n\nnot use the requirement, established in Article 25 of the ICCPR,\n\n\n\ngovernments may take appropriate measures for the fulfillment of\nthe Covenant\" for matters under their jurisdiction) (emphasis\nadded); Exec. Order No. 13,107, 63 Fed. Reg. 68,991 (Dec. 10, 1998)\n(\"It shall be the policy and practice of the Government of the\nUnited States, being committed to the protection and promotion of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, fully to respect and\nimplement its obligations under international human rights treaties\nto which it is a party, including the ICCPR . . . .\").\n      43\n      As Judge Howard notes, this statement from Sosa is not at\nodds with the conclusion that the non-self-execution declaration is\nnot, itself, binding on the courts.       See infra at 105, n.63\n(Howard, J., dissenting).\n\n                                    -65-\n\fthat \"[e]very citizen shall have the right and opportunity . . . to\n\nvote,\"   as    the    basis     for   enforcing        an    individual's         right    to\n\nparticipate in the electoral processes of the United States, until\n\nsuch time as there has been municipal implementation of Article 25\n\nby the enactment of intra-national legislation or constitutional\n\nprovision.         Neither could the courts of the United States order\n\nthat   the     legislative      branch      of    government         live    up    to     the\n\nobligations        undertaken    by   the     United        States    to     \"adopt      such\n\nlegislation or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to\n\n[the right to vote established in Article 25 of the ICCPR].\"                            ICCPR\n\nart.   2,     para.    2.     Such    an    intromission           would     violate      the\n\nconstitutional principle of separation of powers. See Smith & Lee\n\nAssocs., Inc. v. City of Taylor, Mich., 102 F.3d 781, 797 (6th Cir.\n\n1996) (\"Federal Courts do have jurisdiction and power to pass upon\n\nthe constitutionality of Acts of Congress, but we are not aware of\n\nany decision extending this power in Federal Courts to order\n\nCongress      to    enact   legislation.          To    do    so     would    constitute\n\nencroachment upon the functions of a legislative body and would\n\nviolate the time-honored principle of separation of powers of the\n\nthree great departments of our Government.\").                          The majority's\n\ncontentions regarding the trumping of treaty provisions by the\n\nConstitution, maj. op. at 7, are thus inapposite, as I recognize\n\nthe validity of this hierarchy and am not in any way proposing its\n\nviolation.\n\n\n\n                                           -66-\n\f             That said, however, it is an undisputed fact that,\n\ncontrary to the requirements of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the\n\nICCPR, the United States has taken no steps, to date, to implement\n\nthe obligations undertaken therein.               More directly on point, the\n\nUnited     States     has   not    enacted      any    legislation,    passed    any\n\nconstitutional        provision,    or   even     put    in   motion   any   process\n\ndirected at nationally enfranchising the nearly four million United\n\nStates     citizens    residing     in   Puerto       Rico,   notwithstanding    its\n\nratification of the ICCPR and the Senate's acknowledgment \"[t]hat\n\nthe   United      States    understands      that      this   Covenant   shall   be\n\nimplemented by the Federal Government.\"                   138 Cong. Rec. S4781,\n\nS4784 (emphasis added).           Accordingly, the United States is not in\n\ncompliance with the binding obligations it undertook by signing and\n\nratifying the ICCPR.        The majority does not and cannot refute this\n\nundeniable fact, and, as explained below, the potentially non-self-\n\nexecuting nature of the ICCPR does not preclude our ability to make\n\na declaration to that effect, see infra Part III.C.\n\n             2.    Customary international law\n\n             Customary international law constitutes \"those clear and\n\nunambiguous rules by which States universally44 abide, or to which\n\n\n      44\n      The universality requirement does not imply that compliance\nwith customary international law norms be perfect. \"States need\nnot be universally successful in implementing the principle in\norder for a rule of customary international law to arise. If that\nwere the case, there would be no need for customary international\nlaw. But the principle must be more than merely professed or\naspirational.\" Flores, 406 F.3d at 80; see also Restatement § 102,\n\n                                         -67-\n\fthey accede, out of a sense of legal obligation and mutual concern\n\n. . . .\"   Flores v.

The norm in question must be \"specific, universal and\n\nobligatory,\" In re Estate of Ferdinand Marcos, Human Rights Litig.,\n\n25 F.3d 1467, 1475 (9th Cir. 1994), and must be a matter of\n\n\"mutual, and not merely several concern . . . .\"        Flores, 406 F.3d\n\nat 81 (quoting Filartiga v. Peña-Irala, 630 F.2d 876, 888 (2d Cir.\n\n1980)).\n\n            Although the test is demanding, the content of customary\n\ninternational law is not fixed and immutable.      See Sosa, 124 S. Ct.\n\nat 2761-62 (\"[W]e think courts should require any claim based on\n\nthe present-day law of nations to rest on a norm of international\n\ncharacter accepted by the civilized world and defined with a\n\nspecificity    comparable   to   the   features   of   the   18th-century\n\nparadigms we have recognized.\"); Filartiga, 630 F.2d at 881 (\"[I]t\n\nis clear that courts must interpret international law not as it was\n\nin 1789, but as it has evolved and exists among the nations of the\n\nworld today.\") (citing Ware v Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796)\n\n(distinguishing \"ancient\" from \"modern\" law of nations)).

The right\n\nto equal political participation required by these instruments, as\n\noutlined above, is clear and unambiguous.                      The ICCPR, for example,\n\nadmits of no doubt when it states that \"[e]very citizen shall have\n\nthe right and the opportunity . . . [t]o vote . . . at genuine\n\nperiodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage\n\n. . . .\"    ICCPR art. 25.          The universal acceptance of this right to\n\nequal political participation is demonstrated by the prevalence of\n\nthe right in a variety of multinational and regional agreements,\n\nand by the broad acceptance of those agreements by the countries of\n\nthe world.       Currently, for example, 163 nations of the 191-member\n\nUnited Nations are parties to the ICCPR, with an additional seven\n\nsignatories that have not yet ratified the treaty.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -69-\n\f             The right to equal political participation, as evidenced\n\nby these international treaties, covenants, and declarations, is\n\nreinforced by what has become the overwhelming practice worldwide.\n\nSee,    e.g.,   Enrique     Lagos    &   Timothy      D.

Furthermore, the right to vote is directly\n\nprotected   by   Federal    statute,       which     provides    both   civil   and\n\ncriminal penalties for interference therewith, see Voting Rights\n\nAct § 12, 42 U.S.C. § 1973, by several constitutional amendments,\n\nsee U.S. Const., amend. XV (prohibiting discrimination in voting\n\nrights   because   of    race);      id.   amend.    XIX   (prohibiting       voting\n\ndiscrimination by reason of gender); id. amend. XXIII (granting the\n\nresidents of the District of Columbia the right to vote for the\n\nPresident of the United States); id. amend. XXIV (prohibiting poll\n\ntax); id. amend.

See Sosa, 124 S.Ct. at 2764-65 (recognizing a class of\n\ninternational law claims as judicially enforceable federal common\n\nlaw); Kadic v. Karadzic, 70 F.3d 232, 246 (2d Cir. 1995)(terming it\n\na   \"settled    proposition    that   federal   common   law   incorporates\n\ninternational law\"); 13B Charles Alan Wright, et al., Federal\n\nPractice & Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d, § 3585, at 329 (2d ed.,\n\n1984) (\"[T]oday it is not difficult to conclude that customary\n\ninternational law is part of federal common law . . . .\").\n\n             The Supreme Court in Sosa recognized that certain claims\n\nbased on customary international law, as a result of their status\n\nas federal common law, can be enforced in the federal courts under\n\n\n\n                                      -73-\n\fthe Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350.              See Sosa, 124 S.Ct.\n\n2764-65.   Although the Alien Tort Statute grants jurisdiction only\n\nover \"causes where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of\n\nthe law of nations or a treaty of the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1350, the Sosa court did not foreclose the possibility of directly\n\nenforcing some customary international law claims through the\n\nfederal common law when federal jurisdiction is based on other\n\ngrounds.   See Sosa, 124 S.Ct. at 2765, n.19 (expressing doubt, but\n\nleaving open possibility of common law claims for violation of\n\ncustomary international law when jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1331); cf. id. at 2761 (noting that, at least under Alien Tort\n\nStatute, no legal development \"has categorically precluded federal\n\ncourts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an\n\nelement of common law\").       In light of legislative history that\n\nindicates Congress's intent to extend federal jurisdiction over\n\ncases   \"arising   under\"   federal   law   to   the   fullest   extent   the\n\nConstitution would allow, see 2 Cong. Rec. 4986-87 (1874) (\"The\n\n[Judiciary] [A]ct of 1789 did not confer the whole [judicial] power\n\nwhich the Constitution conferred . . . .          This bill does.     . . .\n\nThis bill gives precisely the power which the Constitution confers\n\n-- nothing more, nothing less.\"), we should conclude that the\n\njurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 1331 can encompass claims\n\narising under customary international law as incorporated into the\n\nfederal common law.\n\n\n\n                                  -74-\n\f                The Supreme Court limited recognizable claims, however,\n\nto \"a narrow class of international norms.\"                  Sosa, 124 S. Ct. at\n\n2764.        Specifically, \"courts should require any claim based on the\n\npresent-day law of nations to rest on a norm [1] of international\n\ncharacter [2] accepted by the civilized world and [3] defined with\n\na specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century\n\nparadigms\"          that   were   recognized     at   that   time    as   actionable\n\nviolations of the law of nations.                 Id. at 2761-62.         These were\n\nviolations of international law that \"admitt[ed] of a judicial\n\nremedy and at the same time threaten[ed] serious consequences in\n\ninternational affairs,\" such as the 18th-century prohibitions on\n\nviolation        of    safe   conducts,    infringement      of     the   rights   of\n\nambassadors, and piracy.            Id. at 2756.\n\n                As established above, the first two requirements --\n\ninternational character and broad acceptance -- have been met in\n\nthe case of the customary international law requirement that\n\ncitizens       be     permitted   full   and     equal   participation     in   their\n\ngovernment.          Furthermore, this norm is defined with a specificity\n\ncomparable to the international law norms recognized as actionable\n\nat the founding of our nation.                 Its requirements are clear and\n\ndefinite,47 and the failure to fulfill it can indeed threaten\n\n        47\n        Compare the language of the international instruments\ndescribed above with the extended discussion of the definition of\n\"piracy\" in United States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 153, 160-63\n(1820) and the comment in the dissent that the reason such lengthy\ndiscussion and definition was the \"uncertainty which it was known\nexisted on the subject in the law of nations . . . .\" Id. at 170-71\n\n                                          -75-\n\fserious consequences in international affairs, as evidenced by the\n\npressure exerted by the United States and other governments on non-\n\ndemocratic regimes abroad.   Cf. Case 11.204, Inter-Am.

See Sosa,\n\n124 S.Ct. at 2764-65.   Moreover, it is clear that the United States\n\nis in violation of that norm with respect to the residents of\n\nPuerto Rico.   Were we to avoid this conclusion, we would not just\n\nbe \"avert[ing] [our] gaze entirely from [an] international norm\n\nintended to protect individuals,\" id., but would be placing our\n\nheads into the sand to avoid seeing the obvious.\n\n          In my view, the majority's refusal to incorporate the\n\nclear and specific customary international law norm requiring equal\n\npolitical participation into federal common law contravenes both\n\n\n\n(Livingston, J., dissenting).\n\n                                -76-\n\fthe specific language of the Constitution, see U.S. Const. art. VI,\n\ncl. 2, and relevant Supreme Court doctrine, see Sosa, 124 S.Ct. at\n\n2761-62.\n\n            The majority's concern that customary international law\n\nis a \"diffuse and often highly uncertain body of norms,\" maj. op.\n\nat 13, if true regarding other areas of customary international\n\nlaw, is certainly not true of the right to vote, as demonstrated\n\nabove. Moreover, the majority's contention that \"[i]f there exists\n\nan international norm of democratic government, it is at a level of\n\ngenerality   so   high   as   to   be    unsuitable    for   importation   into\n\ndomestic law,\" maj. op. at 14, misses the point. The international\n\nnorm at issue here is not \"democratic government\" generally, but\n\nthe right to vote in equality with all other citizens of one's\n\nnation.    The majority studiously fails to           provide any example, in\n\nany democratic country, in which citizens are classified into\n\nvoting and non-voting categories.              Its reference to Great Britain\n\nas an example of diversity in democratic governments in which\n\ncitizens neither vote for the head of state nor directly for the\n\ngoverning party, hardly proves the point or even stands for the\n\nproposition that customary international law tolerates unequal\n\nvoting rights among citizens of the same country.                    In Great\n\nBritain, the monarch is only symbolically the head of state.\n\nFurthermore, I was under the impression that in 1776 we rejected\n\nGreat Britain's views regarding colonial government.\n\n\n\n                                        -77-\n\fC.    Remedy\n\n             We commence with the premise that plaintiffs-appellants\n\nhave the right to equal political participation as citizens of the\n\nUnited States, pursuant to customary international law and the\n\nICCPR, both of which are binding on the United States.                                    As\n\nobserved, the United States is currently in violation of these\n\nrequirements. Given the failure by the United States to take steps\n\nto    rectify      this       clear     violation        of       international         law,\n\nnotwithstanding its agreement to do so, see, e.g., Exec. Order No.\n\n13,107, 63 Fed. Reg. 68, 991 (Dec. 10, 1998), this court ought to\n\ntake such measures as are necessary to protect a discrete group of\n\ncitizens that is completely under the sovereignty of the United\n\nStates.      See United States v. Carolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144,\n\n152    n.4     (1938)     (\"[P]rejudice     against           discrete     and    insular\n\nminorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to\n\ncurtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be\n\nrelied    upon    to    protect    minorities,      and       .   .   .   may    call    for\n\ncorrespondingly more searching judicial inquiry.\").\n\n             Although, assuming the ICCPR is not self-executing, we\n\ncannot order legislative action to bring the United States into\n\ncompliance with its international obligations, a stop-gap measure\n\nis    available         and   is      justified     by        plaintiffs-appellants'\n\npredicament.      The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a),\n\nprovides that:\n\n\n                                         -78-\n\f          In a case of actual controversy within its\n          jurisdiction . . . any court of the United\n          States, upon the filing of an appropriate\n          pleading, may declare the rights and other\n          legal relations of any interested party\n          seeking such declaration, whether or not\n          further relief is or could be sought.\n\n          Under this Act, this court may declare the rights, under\n\nthe ICCPR and customary international law, of the United States\n\ncitizens residing in Puerto Rico. \"It is emphatically the province\n\nand duty of the judicial branch to say what the law is.\"         Marbury\n\nv. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803).          The Act provides\n\nthe courts with the option of \"declar[ing] the rights and other\n\nlegal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration,\n\nwhether or not further relief is or could be sought.\" 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2201(a) (emphasis added), particularly when a declaratory judgment\n\n\"will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal\n\nrelations in issue . . . .\" Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Quarles, 92\n\nF.3d 321, 325 (4th Cir. 1937) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          The power to provide declaratory relief extends to the\n\npower to clarify and settle the legal relations between the United\n\nStates   and   the   inhabitants     of   territories    under   Federal\n\nadministration. See United States v. Sanchez, 992 F.2d 1143, 1150-\n\n53 (11th Cir. 1993), rev'd in part on other grounds, 3 F.3d 366\n\n(11th Cir. 1993) (determining that Puerto Rico is not a separate\n\nsovereign for purposes of the double jeopardy clause); see also\n\nUnited States v. Lopez-Andino, 831 F.2d 1164, 1167-68 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n                                   -79-\n\f1987) (holding that Puerto Rico is a separate sovereign for double\n\njeopardy purposes).     \"Courts of the United States have final\n\nauthority to interpret an international agreement for purposes of\n\napplying it as law of the United States.\"   Juda v. United States,\n\n13 Cl. Ct. 667, 678 (Cl. Ct. 1987).\n\n          1.   Redressability\n\n          This type of declaratory relief in the present case is\n\nfully consistent with the Declaratory Judgment Act, because it is\n\nsubstantially likely that a declaration by this Court that the\n\nUnited States is in violation of international law will result in\n\nsome form of relief to the United States citizens who reside in\n\nPuerto Rico.   See Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 463-464 (2002).   In\n\nEvans the Court held that the \"redressability\" element of standing\n\nunder Article III and the Declaratory Judgment Act48 was met in a\n\nsituation in which it was \"'substantially likely'\" that a non-\n\nparty, co-equal branch of government would abide by a federal\n\ncourt's interpretation of the law \"'even though they would not be\n\ndirectly bound by such a determination.'\" Id. at 460 (quoting\n\nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992)). Standing was\n\nestablished because \"the practical consequence of [a court order\n\ndeclaring a census-taking method unlawful] would amount to a\n\nsignificant increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff would\n\n\n     48\n       The \"case-or-controversy\" requirements of Article III and\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act are co-extensive. See Teva Pharm.\nUSA, Inc. v. Pfizer, Inc., 395 F. 3d 1324, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2005).\n\n                                -80-\n\fobtain relief [from the President] that directly redresses the\n\ninjury suffered.\"         Id. at 464 (collecting cases in which standing\n\nhas been found under similar circumstances).\n\n            Similarly, in Juda, one can find an example of the\n\nlegislative branch following the judiciary's interpretation of\n\ninternational law.         In that case, the inhabitants of the Marshall\n\nIslands -- which the United States held under trusteeship from the\n\nUnited   Nations     --    challenged        the    United    States'       attempt     to\n\nunilaterally      terminate        the    Trusteeship       Agreement       by   way    of\n\nPresidential      proclamation,          which     would    have     contravened       the\n\ninternational agreement with the United Nations.                     The Claims Court\n\ndeclared that the Trusteeship remained in effect de jure as a\n\nmatter of international law, and set forth the procedure to be\n\nfollowed by the United States to end it under international law.\n\nId. at 678-82.        Although not bound by that judicial roadmap,\n\nCongress did in fact follow it.               See Joint Resolution to Approve\n\nthe \"Compact of Free Association\" between the United States and the\n\nGovernment of Palau, Pub. L. No. 99-658, § 101, 100 Stat. 3672\n\n(1986); U.N. Security Counsel Res. 683 (Dec. 22, 1990) (terminating\n\nTrusteeship Agreement).\n\n            The    parallel        between    these     cases       and   the    present\n\nsituation is self-evident.               Judge Lipez's attempt to distinguish\n\nthem on the basis that \"the likelihood that Congress and the\n\nPresident    would        follow     the     court's       advice     was    not       just\n\n\n\n                                           -81-\n\f'substantial,' [in those cases], it was a near certainty . . . .\n\n[but] [t]here is nothing approaching such certainty here,\" supra at\n\n28 (Lipez, J., concurring), is unconvincing.        With due respect, it\n\nis the concurrence that engages in speculation.           It seems to me\n\nthat the prediction that Congress would ignore a declaratory\n\njudgment of this court that the United States is not in compliance\n\nwith     its    international   obligations    is   simply   contrary   to\n\nexperience.      Juda, whether dicta or not, see supra at 27 (Lipez,\n\nJ., concurring), bears this out.         We live in a country of laws in\n\nwhich the norm is for all branches of government to respect and\n\ncomply with the decisions of the courts, irrespective of how\n\ndisputed they may be.      See, e.g., Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000).\n\nI cannot countenance that Congress -- nor, for that matter, the\n\nExecutive, which negotiated the ICCPR and is thus intimately\n\ninvolved and committed -- would ignore a judgment of this court\n\ndeclaring that the government has taken no action to comply with an\n\ninternational obligation of the United States, negotiated and\n\nagreed to by the Executive Branch with the advice and consent of\n\nthe Senate.\n\n               The difficulty, complexity, or length of the process\n\nrequired for the United States to comply with the law of the land\n\nis irrelevant, as it has never been a test for redressability of a\n\nwrong.     Cf. Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 301 (1955)\n\n(ordering       racial   desegregation   of   schools   occur   \"with   all\n\n\n\n                                    -82-\n\fdeliberate speed\").   The U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have waited\n\nover one hundred years to regain the voting rights they lost when\n\nthe U.S. invaded in 1898.   A declaratory judgment would be of some\n\nhelp in speeding up the process of recovering these rights.\n\n          Regardless,   however,    of   the    inappropriateness   and\n\nunlikelihood of Congressional inaction in response to a judicial\n\ndeclaration of the rights at issue, it cannot be denied that we\n\nlack authority to order Congress to act.       Even if Congress chooses\n\nto continue on its course of inaction, however, our declaration of\n\nthe plaintiffs' rights under the ICCPR and customary international\n\nlaw would, itself, provide a form of redress.           On this point,\n\nFederal Election Commission v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11 (1998), is\n\ninstructive.   In Akins, a group of voters filed an administrative\n\ncomplaint with the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\") asking it to\n\nforce a certain political organization to comply with the reporting\n\nrequirements for political action committees (\"PACs\").       See id. at\n\n17.   The FEC dismissed the complaint on the ground that the\n\norganization did not fit the definition of a PAC under federal law.\n\nSee id. The voters appealed the FEC's dismissal of their complaint\n\nand the FEC defended on the ground that the voters' claim was not\n\nredressable.    See id. at 19.     The FEC argued that, even if it\n\nmisinterpreted the definition of a PAC, it maintained the option\n\nnot to act on the voters' complaint as a matter of prosecutorial\n\ndiscretion.    See id. at 25.    The Court disagreed that the FEC's\n\n\n\n                                 -83-\n\fdiscretionary authority deprived the voters of standing.               See id.\n\nThe Court explained that, even though the FEC might ultimately\n\ndecline to act on the voters' complaint, the voters' injury was\n\nredressed by assuring that the FEC's discretionary decision was\n\nbased on a correct understanding of the relevant law.\n\n           This    case    presents   an     analogous   circumstance.     The\n\nplaintiffs have alleged that Congress has an obligation under the\n\nICCPR and customary international law to further their right to\n\nvote for President and that since the ICCPR was ratified, Congress\n\nhas taken no action in this regard.            It is possible that Congress\n\nhas not acted in accord with its obligations because it is unaware\n\nof them.   By issuing a declaration stating the plaintiffs' rights\n\nunder the ICCPR and customary international law, the court can\n\ncorrect this potential misunderstanding.              To be sure, an Article\n\nIII court cannot order Congress to pass a law, just as it cannot\n\norder the executive to prosecute a particular case.               But, as in\n\nAkins, a declaration can ensure that the government actor in\n\nquestion   (here   Congress)    exercises       its   responsibility   with   a\n\ncorrect understanding of the relevant legal principles. This is no\n\nguarantee that the Congress will exercise its discretion favorably\n\nto the plaintiff.         But, as Akins makes clear, there is no such\n\nrequirement.   See id. at 25; Evans, 536 U.S. at 464 (stating that\n\nredressability is established where court action \"would amount to\n\n\n\n\n                                      -84-\n\fa significant increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff would\n\nobtain the relief that directly redresses the injury suffered\").\n\n          Ultimately, I simply do not agree with Judge Lipez's\n\nreading of the Utah and Juda cases, nor with his conclusions\n\nregarding redressability.   Obviously, the ideal remedy would be if\n\nwe could order that plaintiffs be allowed to vote.       Barring a\n\nfinding that the ICCPR is self-executing, that remedy is not\n\navailable.   Continued non-compliance, however, is a circumstance\n\nthat cannot be ignored any longer.    The honor and credibility of\n\nthe United States are at stake.\n\n          Plaintiffs-appellants, citizens of the United States, are\n\ndenied the right to vote for the offices of President and Vice\n\nPresident of our nation in violation of the ICCPR and customary\n\ninternational law.   Further, it is an unquestionable fact that the\n\nUnited States has not met its obligation under the ICCPR to take\n\nsteps toward allowing these citizens to exercise this fundamental\n\nright.   See ICCPR art. 2, para. 2.   It must be assumed that the\n\nUnited States will give effect to a judicial declaration stating\n\nits failure to meet its obligations in this respect, and, at a\n\nminimum, we must ensure that any future inaction by the government\n\nis not based on an inaccurate understanding of its obligations\n\nunder international law.\n\n\n\n\n                               -85-\n\f            2.    \"Embarrassment\" v. Equality\n\n            If    the   majority      were   to   conclude    that    plaintiffs-\n\nappellants' allegations are not supported by the law, although I\n\nobviously disagree with this conclusion, I would accept it as part\n\nof the judicial process in which diversity of opinion is a fact of\n\njudicial review. However, I cannot accept, and am highly disturbed\n\nby, the proposition espoused by the majority that the outcome of\n\nthis appeal should in any way be dictated by its perception that a\n\ndeclaration by this court that the United States has failed to\n\ncomply with its treaty obligations might \"embarrass\" the United\n\nStates and \"could be trumpeted as propaganda in international\n\nbodies and elsewhere.\"           Maj. op. at 12.        These statements are\n\nworrisome because they demonstrate a misperception of the role of\n\nfederal courts vis-à-vis treaties and other international law. The\n\ninterpretation of treaties and international law, as an integral\n\npart of the law of the land, is a nondelegable judicial duty and\n\nfunction that cannot be avoided by this court.                  Indeed, federal\n\ncourts are the final interpreters of treaties.               Juda, 13 Cl. Ct. at\n\n678.   The United States is just another party in this case, as it\n\nis in the thousands that are heard before the federal courts\n\nthroughout the nation.       It has no higher standing than any other\n\nparty,   and     is   entitled   to    no    higher   privilege      than   private\n\ncitizens.      It is precisely because the courts of the United States\n\nare perceived by the world at large as upholding these high\n\n\n                                       -86-\n\fstandards       of   impartiality     that     a   declaration   exposing         the\n\ngovernment's failure to comply with its treaty obligations, rather\n\nthan \"embarrassing\" the U.S., as the majority suggests, would have\n\na highly salutary effect by showing the world that we practice what\n\nwe preach:      the rule of law.\n\n            Embarrassment indeed!          The U.S. should be embarrassed at\n\nits denying equal rights to four million of its citizens in this\n\nday and age.         That fact itself -- particularly in light of the\n\ngovernment's intense encouragement of democratic reform in other\n\nnations and purported commitment to international instruments that\n\nguarantee equal political participation by all citizens -- could be\n\n\"trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere.\"\n\nMaj. op. at 12.           Was it \"embarrassment\" that finally reversed\n\nPlessy?    If embarrassment is what it takes to give equal rights to\n\nthe    United    States    citizens   of     Puerto   Rico,   maybe    a   dose   is\n\nappropriate.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            There comes a point when the courts must intervene to\n\ncorrect a great wrong, particularly one of their own creation,\n\nbecause the political branches of government cannot or will not\n\nact.    See, e.g., Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483.               This case is\n\nsuch a crossroads in history. This court cannot further \"avert its\n\ngaze,\" Sosa, 124 S.Ct. at 2764-65, without becoming an accomplice\n\n\n\n\n                                       -87-\n\fto   this   monumental   injustice   to   Puerto   Rico's   nationally\n\ndisenfranchised United States citizens.\n\n            Shortly before the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said:    \"As\n\nI would not be a slave, so I would not be a master.    This expresses\n\nmy idea of democracy.    Whatever differs from this, to the extent of\n\nthe difference, is no democracy.\"         President Abraham Lincoln,\n\nAddress to Indiana Regiment (Aug. 1, 19858) in II The Collected\n\nWorks of Abraham Lincoln 532 (Roy P. Basler ed., 1953) (emphasis\n\nremoved from original).    Substitute \"colonized\" for \"a slave\" and\n\n\"colonizer\" for \"master\" in this quote, and we are where the United\n\nStates citizens of Puerto Rico find themselves today in their\n\nsubservient political condition within the United States' political\n\nhegemony.\n\n            The opinion of the district court should therefore be\n\nreversed, and the case remanded for the entry of a declaratory\n\njudgment to the effect that the United States has taken no steps to\n\nmeet its obligations under the ICCPR and customary international\n\nlaw to grant equal voting rights to all citizens in the election of\n\nthe President and Vice President of the United States.\n\n            E pluribus unum.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -88-\n\f                HOWARD, Circuit Judge, (dissenting).            The inability of\n\nAmerican citizens residing in the territories to participate in the\n\nelection         of    our   nation's   leaders     is     antithetical   to   our\n\nfoundational democratic values.           Like Judge Torruella, Judge Leval\n\nof the Second Circuit49 has observed that excluding these United\n\nStates citizens from voting for President of the United States\n\nposes        serious   “problems   of   fairness,    resentment     and   impaired\n\nreputation in the community of nations.”                 Romeu v. Cohen, 265 F.3d\n\n118, 128 (2nd Cir. 2001)(Leval, J., writing separately).\n\n                Constructively, Judge Leval has explained in some detail\n\nhow legislation could constitutionally provide for participation by\n\nPuerto Ricans in Presidential elections.                  See id. at 128-30; but\n\nsee id. at 131-36 (Walker, C.J., disputing that Congress has such\n\npower, while sharing the concern \"that the U.S. citizens residing\n\nin the territories are not being afforded a meaningful voice in\n\nnational governance.\").            There is every reason to expect that\n\npeople of good will serving in our legislative and executive\n\nbranches would seriously consider Judge Leval’s proposal among\n\nother options, were the plaintiffs to successfully prosecute this\n\naction.        But this is not to endorse any particular implementation\n\nof voting rights – the preferences of the people of Puerto Rico are\n\nof paramount consideration.             It is instead to acknowledge that\n\nthere could be approaches beyond what many have assumed.\n\n\n        49\n             Now Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n                                        -89-\n\f           More generally, while it may be that the Constitution\n\ndoes not itself confer voting rights upon citizens, generations of\n\nAmericans have rightly taken as an article of faith their ability\n\nto participate in the selection of our national leaders through the\n\nfranchise.50     In   seeking     to   participate   in    the   Presidential\n\nelection, the plaintiffs attempt to assert a right long held by\n\nlaw abiding United States citizens of age, whether at home or\n\nabroad,   so   long   as   they   are    not   residents    of   one   of   the\n\nterritories.    Because the interest represented by the plaintiffs'\n\nclaim is of paramount importance to our democratic structure, we\n\nought to approach their claim searchingly rather than skeptically,51\n\nwith the understanding that the court’s declaratory authority\n\nshould be exercised to its outermost limits if the claim is\n\n\n     50\n      \"[T]he right to vote, as the citizen's link to his laws and\ngovernment, is protective of all fundamental rights and\nprivileges.\" Evans v. Cornman, 398 U.S. 419, 422 (1970). \"[M]ost\nU.S. citizens have a limited, constitutionally enforceable right to\nvote in presidential elections as those elections are currently\nconfigured. The States have uniformly exercised their Article II\nauthority by delegating the power to appoint presidential (and\nvice-presidential) electors to U.S. citizens residing in the State\nto be exercised in democratic elections.\" Romeu, 265 F.3d at 123.\n     51\n      \"Since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and\nunimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and\npolitical rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens\nto vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.\" Reynolds\nv.

Union Free\nSchool District, 395 U.S. 621, 626 (1969) (\"[C]areful examination\nis necessary because statutes distributing the franchise constitute\nthe foundation of our representative society.

We should take care that the claims of American\n\ncitizens who assert a basic right to participate in the democratic\n\nprocess do not suffer stillbirth through exacting application of\n\nredressability doctrines that, as Judge Torruella has pointed out,\n\nhave significant flexibility.\n\n          Turning directly to the plaintiffs' treaty claim, even if\n\nthere were a persuasive argument not to accept Judge Torruella's\n\nreasoning, the case still should not end at this stage.    This is\n\nbecause plaintiffs' claim under the ICCPR should not be resolved on\n\na motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) without an opportunity for\n\nrecord development.52\n\n           The United States signed the ICCPR in 1977.    Among its\n\nprovisions, Article 25 provides:\n\n          Every citizen shall have the right and\n          opportunity    and    without    unreasonable\n          restrictions to take part in the conduct of\n          public affairs, directly or through freely\n          chosen representatives and to vote and to be\n          elected at genuine periodic elections which\n          shall be by universal and equal suffrage and\n          shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing\n          the free expression of the will of the\n          electors.\n\n999 U.N.T.S. 171 (opened for signature Dec. 19, 1966).   The Senate\n\ndid not provide its advice and consent for the ICCPR until 1992. In\n\nconsenting to the Treaty, the Senate added a declaration stating\n\n\n     52\n      Beyond my own views expressed here, I agree with much of\nJudge Torruella's dissent. In particular, I agree substantially\nwith his reasoning in Parts I., II. B. 1., and II. C. 1. and join\nhim in those respects.\n\n                                -91-\n\fthat the ICCPR will be \"non-self-executing,\"53 as requested by the\n\nexecutive.   S. Exec. Rep. No. 102-23 at 23 (1992) (\"[T]he United\n\nStates declares that the provisions of Articles 1 through 27 of the\n\nCovenant are not self-executing.\").54    From this declaration, one\n\nmight conclude that the plaintiffs do not have enforceable rights\n\nunder Article 25 of the Treaty.55     But in my view, separation of\n\npowers considerations prevent a court from relying exclusively on\n\nthe Senate's declaration to determine that a treaty is non-self-\n\nexecuting. The Supremacy Clause and Article III require a court to\n\nexamine independently the intentions of the treatymakers to decide\n\nif a treaty, by its own force, creates individually enforceable\n\n\n\n     53\n      Courts and commentators have used the term \"non-self-\nexecuting\" to mean many things.    See D. Cinotti, Note, The New\nIsolationism: Non-Self-Execution Declarations and Treaties as the\nSupreme Law of the Land, 91 Geo. L. Rev. 1277, 1279 (2003). For\npurposes of this opinion, I understand the term to mean that a\ntreaty does not create individually enforceable rights without the\npassage of implementing legislation. See Columbia Marine Servs.,\nInc. v. Reffet Ltd., 861 F.2d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 1988) (stating that\nin order for an action to arise under a treaty for purposes of 28\nU.S.C. § 1331, \"the treaty must be self-executing, i.e., it must\nprescribe rules by which private rights may be determined\"); J.\nPaust, Avoiding \"Fraudulent\" Executive Policy: Analysis of the\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, 42 De Paul L. Rev. 1257,\n1258 n.4 (1992) (explaining that the purpose of the non-self-\nexecution declaration in the ICCPR was intended to assure that the\nTreaty would not create a private cause of action in U.S. courts).\n     54\n      Articles 1 through 27 are the rights-granting provisions of\nthe ICCPR.\n     55\n      It might also be said that as a prudential matter the\nSenate's declaration precludes relief under the Declaratory\nJudgment Act. For the reasons expressed herein, I would not decide\nthis prudential question at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\n                               -92-\n\frights.   While the Senate's preratification view on the matter is\n\nentitled to some weight, other facts, including extrinsic evidence\n\nconcerning     the   Treaty's   negotiation    history   and   international\n\npractice under the Treaty, are relevant.           Because the procedural\n\nposture   of   this   case   has   precluded   introduction     of   evidence\n\nregarding the ICCPR's negotiation and enforcement history, it is\n\npremature to dismiss on the ground that the Treaty does not provide\n\nthe plaintiffs with enforceable rights.\n\n           The Senate's practice of declaring certain treaties to be\n\nnon-self-executing is of relatively recent origin.56 See L. Henkin,\n\nForeign Affairs and the United States Constitution, 201-02 (2d ed.\n\n1996).    This practice has become commonplace especially, although\n\nnot exclusively, for human rights treaties, see L. Damrosch, The\n\nRole of the United States Senate Concerning \"Self-Executing\" and\n\n\"Non-Self-Executing\" Treaties, 67 Chi-Kent L. Rev. 515, 519-26\n\n(1991), and has been accepted in some quarters, see Restatement\n\n(Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States § 303, cmt.\n\n\n\n     56\n      This practice appears to be, at least in part, a response to\nthe proposed Bricker Amendment, which would have amended the\nConstitution to require implementing legislation before a treaty\ncould have domestic effect. See S.J. Res. 130, printed at 98 Cong.\nRec. 907-08 (1952). Some scholars have concluded that the Senate\nviewed non-self-executing declarations as a way to achieve the\nobjectives of the Bricker Amendment without having to amend the\nConstitution. See L. Henkin, U.S. Ratification of Human Rights\nConventions: The Ghost of Senator Bricker, 89 Am. J. Int'l L. 341,\n348-50 (1995). See also D. Sloss, The Domestication of Int'l Human\nRights: Non-Self-Executing Declarations and Human Rights Treaties,\n24 Yale J.

Rev. 1082, 1111 (1992) (describing the rule under British law\n\nthat a treaty does not have domestic effect until Parliament passes\n\nimplementing         legislation).          This    is     a    direct   result   of        the\n\nSupremacy Clause, which makes treaties part of the \"supreme law of\n\nthe land\" along with federal statutes, federal common law, and the\n\nConstitution         itself.         U.S.   Const.       art.     VI.,   cl.   2.57         The\n\nConstitution's          grant   of    power    to    the       federal   judiciary         also\n\nrecognizes that treaties constitute domestic law.                         Under article\n\nIII, § 2, cl. 1, the federal judicial power \"extend[s] to all\n\nCases, in Law and Equity arising under . . . Treaties.\"                                    The\n\n\n     57\n          The Supremacy Clause states:\n\n                This Constitution, and the Laws of the\n                United States made in Pursuance Thereof;\n                and all which shall be made in Pursuance\n                Thereof; and all Treaties made, or which\n                shall be made, under the Authority of the\n                United States, shall be the supreme law\n                of the land; and the judges in every\n                State shall be bound thereby, any Thing\n                in the Constitution of Laws of any State\n                to    the    Contrary    notwithstanding.\n                (Emphasis supplied).\n\n                                            -94-\n\fexpress language of the Constitution thus provides that a treaty\n\nratified by the President, after the Senate's advice and consent,\n\nsee U.S. Const. art. II, § 2, cl. 2, is part of our domestic law\n\nand may be enforced in a domestic court.\n\n           This is not a historical accident, for incorporating\n\ntreaties into the domestic law was one of the purposes for drafting\n\nthe Constitution.    Under the Articles of Confederation, the States\n\nwere reluctant to enforce treaties entered into by the national\n\ngovernment.     In proposing the Virginia Plan as the working draft\n\nfor the new Constitution, Edmund Randolph complained about the\n\nArticles' powerlessness to \"cause infractions of treaties . . . to\n\nbe punished.\"    1 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention\n\nof 1787 19 (rev. ed. 1996).     James Madison shared this view.    He\n\nclaimed that \"experience [under the Articles] had evidenced a\n\nconstant tendency in the States to . . . violate national Treaties\n\n. . . .\"      Id. at 164.   The Constitution sought to remedy this\n\ntendency by making treaties \"the supreme law of the land.\"\n\n           The Framers' intention to establish treaties as law,\n\nwithout further legislative action, is demonstrated by several of\n\nthe proposals that the Constitutional Convention rejected.        One\n\nsuch proposal would have required that treaties be sanctioned by\n\nlegislation if they were to have \"the operation of laws.\"          J.\n\nMadison, Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 520\n\n(1966 ed.).    Another would have established two types of treaties:\n\n\n                                 -95-\n\fone requiring only action by the President and the Senate, and a\n\nsecond requiring additional action by the House of Representatives.\n\nSee 2 Farrand, supra at 394.          The rejection of these proposals\n\nillustrates the Framers' intention that all treaties constitute law\n\nunder the Supremacy Clause.58          As James    Wilson stated: \"[The\n\nSupremacy Clause] will show the world that we make the faith of\n\ntreaties a constitutional part of the character of the United\n\nStates; that we secure [their] performance no longer nominally, for\n\nthe judges of the United States will be enabled to carry [them]\n\ninto effect.\"         2 J. Elliot, The Debates in the Several State\n\nConventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed.\n\n1881).\n\n            The expectation that treaties would become operative as\n\ndomestic law upon ratification is also expressed in the Federalist\n\nPapers    and   the   ratification   debates   within   the   States.   For\n\nexample, in Federalist No. 22, Alexander Hamilton explained that\n\n\"the treaties of the United States, to have any force at all, must\n\nbe considered as part of the law of the land.           Their true import,\n\nas far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws, be\n\nascertained by judicial determinations.\"         The Federalist No.22 at\n\n\n\n     58\n      In a similar vein, the Committee on Style removed from the\nfinal version of the Supremacy Clause language that would have\ngiven the national government the power to \"enforce treaties.\" The\nCommittee removed this language because it was redundant; the\nSupremacy Clause already declared that treaties were law.\nSee Farrand, supra, at 389-90.\n\n                                     -96-\n\f150 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).            Similarly, at the North Carolina\n\nratifying    convention,   one     of    the   Constitution's   supporters\n\nexplained:\n\n            It was necessary that treaties should operate\n            as laws on individuals.      They ought to be\n            binding upon us the moment they are made. They\n            involve in their nature not only our own\n            rights, but those of foreigners and should be\n            protected by the federal judiciary.\n\n4 Elliot, supra at 158.         Even those opposing ratification shared\n\nin this view.     \"Brutus,\" in criticizing Article III, stated that\n\nhe could \"readily comprehend what is meant by deciding a case\n\nunder a treaty.      For as treaties will be the law of the land,\n\nevery person who has rights or privileges secured by a treaty,\n\nwill have the aid of courts in recovering them.\"            16 J. Kaminski\n\nand G. Saladino, The Documentary History of the Ratification of\n\nthe Constitution 172 (1984).\n\n            One   commentator    has    summarized   the   founding   period\n\nevidence as follows:\n\n            [The] historic patterns of expectation\n            demonstrate that most Framers intended all\n            treaties immediately to become binding on\n            the whole nation, superadded to the laws of\n            the land; to be observed by every member of\n            the nation, to be applied by the courts\n            whenever a cause of action arose from or\n            touched upon them; and to prevail over and\n            preemept any existing state action.      In\n            these ways, at least, all treaties (to the\n            extent of their grants, guarantees, or\n            obligations) were to be self-executing.\n\nSee J. Paust, Self-Executing Treaties, 82 Am. J. Int'l L.\n\n\n                                       -97-\n\f760, 764 (1988).59\n\n           This understanding quickly found its way into the United\n\nStates Reports.     See Ware v. Hylton, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796).\n\nWare concerned the 1783 Peace Treaty with Great Britain.                  The\n\nplaintiff, a British citizen, claimed that he was owed a debt by a\n\nVirginia citizen.    See id. at 199-201.      The defendant claimed that\n\nthe debt had been extinguished by a 1777 Virginia statute.           See id.\n\nThe treaty provided, however, that \"creditors, on either side, shall\n\nmeet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of full value of all\n\nbona fide debts heretofore contracted.\"        Id. at 277.     The British\n\nplaintiff argued that this treaty provision overrode the Virginia\n\nstatute and reinstated the debt.       See id. at 209.\n\n           Justice Iredell, sitting as a circuit judge, considered\n\nwhether   the   treaty   was   operative   without   the   passage   of   any\n\nadditional domestic legislation.      He recognized that, under the law\n\nof Great Britain, a treaty would not be operative domestically\n\nwithout implementing legislation, but that the purpose of the\n\nSupremacy Clause was to differentiate the effect of treaties under\n\nAmerican law:\n\n\n\n\n     59\n      For a fuller discussion, see Paust, supra; Vázquez, supra;\nand M. Flaherty, History Right?: Historical Scholarship, Original\nUnderstanding, and Treaties as \"Supreme Law of the Land\", 99 Colum.\nL. Rev. 2095 (1999).     For an alternate interpretation of the\nFounding period, see J. Yoo, Globalism and the Constitution:\nTreaties, Non-Self-Execution, and the Original Understanding, 99\nColum. L. Rev. 1955 (1999).\n\n                                   -98-\n\f           Under this constitution, therefore, so far as\n           a treaty constitutionally is binding, upon\n           principles of moral obligation, it is also, by\n           the vigor of its own authority, to be executed\n           in fact.     It would not otherwise be the\n           supreme law, in the new sense provided for,\n           and it was so before, in a moral sense. . . .\n           [W]hen the constitution was ratified, the case\n           as to the treaty in question stood upon the\n           same footing, as if every act constituting an\n           impediment to a creditor's recovery had been\n           expressly repealed, and any further act\n           passed, which the public obligation had before\n           required, if a repeal alone would not have\n           been sufficient.\n\nId.\n\n           The case went to the Supreme Court, where each Justice\n\nwrote his own opinion.   No Justice disagreed with Justice Iredell's\n\nexplanation of the domestic effect of the treaty.     See id. at 237\n\n(\"[E]very treaty made by authority of the United States, shall be\n\nsuperior to the constitution and laws of any individual state. . .\n\n.\") (Chase, J.).   Ware thus supports the view that, when a treaty\n\ncreates obligations favoring an individual, the individual may\n\nenforce the obligation directly in a United States court, even\n\nthough there is no implementing legislation.60      In other words,\n\nunder American law, treaties can be self-executing.   See Head Money\n\nCases, 112 U.S. 580, 598-99 (1884) (\"A treaty . . . is a law of the\n\nland as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions prescribe a\n\n\n\n      60\n      In another early case, Chief Justice Marshall echoed this\nsentiment. Owings v. Norwood Lessee, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 344, 348-49\n(1809) (\"Whenever a right grows out of, or is protected by a\ntreaty, it is to be protected.\").\n\n                                -99-\n\frule by which the rights of the private citizen . . . may be\n\ndetermined.   And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in\n\na court of justice, that court resorts to the treaty for a rule of\n\ndecision for the case before it as it would to a statute.\").\n\n          The suggestion that some treaties are not self-executing\n\nfirst appeared in Foster v. Nielson, 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253 (1829),\n\noverruled in part by United States v. Percheman, 32 U.S. 51 (1833)\n\n(reinterpreting treaty in light of new evidence regarding meaning\n\nof ambiguous term). There, a treaty with Spain, designed to protect\n\nprivate land grants, provided that \"grants shall be ratified and\n\nconfirmed.\"   Id. at 309.    Writing for the Court, Chief Justice\n\nMarshall concluded that the treaty was not self-executing because,\n\nby its terms, it did not establish a right in an individual but\n\nrather placed an obligation on the legislative branch to act.\n\nSee id. at 314.   As Chief Justice Marshall explained:\n\n          Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law\n          of the land. It is consequently to be regarded\n          in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of\n          the legislature, whenever it operates of itself,\n          without the aid of any legislative provision.\n          But when the terms of the stipulation import a\n          contract, where either of the parties engages to\n          perform a particular act, the treaty addresses\n          itself to the political, not the judicial\n          department; and the legislature must execute the\n          contract before it can be become a rule for the\n          court.\n\nId.\n\n          The Foster rule -- that certain treaties are non-self-\n\nexecuting -- is a judicially-created doctrine.     See Henkin, The\n\n                               -100-\n\fGhost of Senator Bricker, supra at 347.          Under this doctrine, a\n\ncourt must ascertain whether the instrument was intended by its\n\nmakers to establish directly enforceable rights, or only to impose\n\nan obligation on one of the political branches.            See Frolova v.\n\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, 761 F.2d 30, 373 (7th Cir.\n\n1985) (\"Whether a treaty is self-executing is an issue for judicial\n\ninterpretation.\"); Restatement supra at § 111, cmt. h (\"Whether an\n\nagreement is to be given effect without further legislation is an\n\nissue that a court must decide when a party seeks to invoke the\n\nagreement as law.\").      Such an intent is to be gleaned from the\n\ntreaty's terms and history. See Diggs v. Richardson, 555 F.2d 841,\n\n851 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (stating that, \"[i]n determining whether a\n\ntreaty is self-executing courts look to the intent of the signatory\n\nparties as manifested by the language of the instrument, and if the\n\ninstrument is uncertain, recourse must be had to the circumstances\n\nsurrounding its execution\").\n\n           Given this constitutional and judicial history, a court\n\nought not quickly conclude that treaties are non-self-executing.\n\nCf. United States v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir. 2000) (en banc)\n\n(stating   that   there   is   a   presumption   against   self-executing\n\ntreaties under American law).61       Rather, a court must conduct an\n\nindependent and searching inquiry into the treaty's purpose.          And\n\n\n\n     61\n      Judge Torruella took a similar view in his dissent in Li.\nSee 206 F.3d at 70-71.\n\n                                   -101-\n\fon this point a declaration by the Senate that a treaty is non-\n\nself-executing should not be dispositive.\n\n               Those holding a contrary view tend to regard the Senate's\n\npower to declare a treaty non-self-executing to be an adjunct of\n\nits general power to consent to ratification.                 See Restatement\n\nsupra at § 303, cmt. d.             There is no doubt that the Senate may\n\nhinge its consent to ratify a treaty on a reservation.                See Haver\n\nv. Yaker, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 32, 35 (1869).            But a reservation is a\n\n\"unilateral statement . . . whereby [one party] purports to exclude\n\nor to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty\n\nin the application to that State.\"            Vienna Convention on the Law of\n\nTreaties, art. 2(1)(d) (1969).              A reservation thus has an actual\n\neffect    on    the    terms   of    the    treaty.   See   M.     Glennon,   The\n\nConstitutional Power of the United States Senate to Condition Its\n\nConsent to Treaties, 67 Chi.-Kent. L. Rev. 533, 542 n. 63 (1991)\n\n(citing authority).       And the reservation will vitiate the Senate's\n\nconsent   if     its   terms   are    not    incorporated   into    the   treaty.\n\nSee Henkin, Foreign Affairs, supra at 180-81.\n\n               A non-self-execution declaration differs materially from\n\na reservation.         See Restatement, supra at § 314, cmt. d.               The\n\ndeclaration is not presented to the other international signatories\n\nas a request for a modification of the treaty's terms.               Rather, it\n\nis directed primarily toward United States courts to express \"the\n\nsense of the Senate\" that the treaty should not be interpreted to\n\n\n                                       -102-\n\festablish    individually   enforceable   rights.   As   two   leading\n\ncommentators have explained, the Senate does not have the power to\n\nbind a court to such declarations:\n\n            [T]he Senate lacks the constitutional authority\n            to declare the non-self-executing character of\n            a treaty with binding effect on U.S. courts.\n            The Senate has the unicameral power only to\n            consent to ratification of treaties, not to\n            pass domestic legislation.    A declaration is\n            not part of a treaty in the sense of modifying\n            the legal obligations created by it.          A\n            declaration is merely an expression of an\n            interpretation or of a policy or position.\n            U.S. courts are bound by the Constitution to\n            apply treaties as the law of the land. They\n            are not bound to apply expressions of opinion\n            adopted by the Senate (and concurred in by the\n            President).   The courts must undertake their\n            own examination of the terms and context of\n            each provision in a treaty to which the United\n            States is a party and decide whether it is\n            self-executing.    The treaty is law.       The\n            Senate's declaration is not law. The Senate\n            does not have the power to make law outside the\n            treaty instrument.\n\nS. Riesenfeld & F. Abbott, Foreword: Symposium of Parliamentary\n\nParticipation in the Making and Operation of Treaties, 67 Chi.-\n\nKent L. Rev. 293, 296-97 (1991).62\n\n\n     62\n      Other commentators, including Professor Henkin, share this\nview. See Henkin, Foreign Affairs, supra at 202 (describing the\nSenate's practice of declaring treaties as non-self executing to be\n\"anti-Constitutional in spirit and highly problematic as a matter\nof law\"); Henkin, The Ghost of Senator Bricker, supra at 346\n(stating that non-self-execution declarations by the Senate \"may be\nunconstitutional\"). See also D. Cinnoti, supra; J. Quigley, The\nRule of Non-Inquiry and Human Rights Treaties, 45 Cath. L. Rev.\n1213 (1995); J. Quigley, The Int'l Covenant on Civil and Political\nRights and the Supremacy Clause, 42 De Paul L. Rev. 1287 (1993);\nPaust, Avoiding Fraudulent Executive Policy, supra; C. Dearborn,\nNote, The Domestic Legal Effect of Declarations that Treaty\n\n                                -103-\n\f           Stated differently, the Senate's power under Article II\n\nextends only to the making of reservations that require changes\n\nto a treaty before the Senate's consent will be efficacious.         A\n\ndeclaration that only has domestic effect is, in reality, an\n\nattempt to legislate concerning the internal implementation of a\n\ntreaty.   But the power to legislate is not granted to the Senate\n\nunder Article   II.    Legislation may only be enacted through\n\nbicameral adoption and presentation to the President as set forth\n\nin Article I.   See INS v. Chada, 462 U.S. 919 (1983).\n\n           The only case that I am aware of that addresses a similar\n\nquestion supports this view.     In Power Authority of New York v.\n\nFederal Power Commission, 247 F.2d 538 (D.C. Cir.), vacated and\n\nremanded with instructions to dismiss as moot 355 U.S. 64 (1957),\n\nthe United States entered a bilateral treaty with Canada concerning\n\nthe use of the Niagara River to produce power along the United\n\nStates/Canada   border.    See   id.   at   539.   In   its   resolution\n\nconsenting to the treaty, the Senate included a reservation whereby\n\nthe United States reserved the right to redevelop its portion of\n\nthe power generated on the river only through an act of Congress.\n\nSee id.   The United States and Canada agreed that the reservation\n\nonly concerned American domestic law and did not require any\n\nchanges to the treaty.    See id. at 540-41.\n\n\n\nProvisions Are Not-Self-Executing, 57 Tex. L. Rev. 233 (1979).\n\n\n                                 -104-\n\f            The Power Authority of the State of New York sought a\n\nlicense from the Federal Power Commission to use the Niagara River\n\nfor the state's anticipated power project.          See id. at 539.    The\n\nCommission    dismissed     the     authority's    license   application,\n\ncontending that the Senate's reservation precluded it from granting\n\nsuch a license because federal legislation was required.          See id.\n\nat 539-40.\n\n            The    D.C.   Circuit    held   that   the   reservation   was\n\nineffective because it involved only United States domestic law.\n\nFor the reservation to be binding on the judiciary, the court\n\nreasoned, it had to constitute an actual part of the treaty:\n\n            A true reservation which becomes a part of a\n            treaty is one which alters the effect of the\n            treaty insofar as it may apply in the relations\n            of the State with the other State or States\n            which may be parties to the treaty. It creates\n            a different relationship between the parties\n            and varies the obligations of the parties\n            proposing it.\n\nId. at 541.       Because the reservation was merely an expression of\n\nthe Senate's view of domestic policy it had no domestic effect.\n\nSee id.63\n\n\n     63\n      Sosa v. Alvarez-Machian, 124 S. Ct. 2739 (2004) is not to the\ncontrary. That case involved whether the right to be free from\narbitrary abduction and detention was protected under customary\ninternational law.   The plaintiff in Sosa did not sue directly\nunder the ICCPR but rather argued that the Treaty's terms helped\nestablish the relevant principle of customary international law for\npurposes of his Alien Tort Act claim.     The Court relied on the\nSenate's non-self-execution declaration in the ICCPR as one factor\nto support its conclusion that the ICCPR could not, by itself,\nestablish a rule of customary international law. See id. at 2763\n\n                                    -105-\n\f            The non-self-execution declaration in the ICCPR is a\n\nsimilar expression of the Senate's desire concerning a purely\n\ndomestic issue.          Like the reservation in Power Authority, the\n\ndeclaration was not intended to modify the Treaty terms in any way.\n\nThus, it lacks binding force. Cf. Fourteen Diamond Rings v. United\n\nStates, 183 U.S. 176, 178-80 (holding that a Senate resolution\n\npurporting to interpret a treaty adopted after ratification was not\n\nbinding).    Of course, the Senate's view is relevant.           Cf. United\n\nStates v. Stuart, 489 U.S. 353, 366-67 (1989) (stating that Senate\n\npreratification debate is relevant to determining the meaning of\n\na treaty).       But, in the end, whether there is a private right of\n\naction under the ICCPR should be decided on the basis of the\n\ntotality    of    available     evidence.     See   Volkswagenwerk    A.G.   v.\n\nSchlunk, 486 U.S. 694, 700 (1988) (\"Treaties are construed more\n\nliberally than private agreements, and to ascertain their meaning\n\nwe may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty\n\nnegotiations,      and    the   practical    construction   adopted   by     the\n\nparties.\"); see also Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v.\n\n\n\n& 2767. But the Court was not faced with (and did not decide)\nwhether the Senate's declaration ipso facto prevents a plaintiff\nfrom suing directly under the Treaty. Because the question in Sosa\nwas not the binding effect of the Senate's non-self-execution\ndeclaration in determining whether the ICCPR establishes a private\ncause of action, the parties did not present the Court with (and it\ndid not address) the separation of powers arguments questioning the\nSenate's authority to issue such declarations. See, e.g., Reply\nBrief of United States at 8, Sosa, supra.\n\n\n                                     -106-\n\fU.S. Dist. Ct. for the S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 534 (1987)\n\n(stating that treaty interpretation begins with the text of the\n\ntreaty, but that the treaty's history and practical construction\n\nadopted by the parties are relevant); Air France v. Saks, 470 U.S.\n\n392, 400 (1985) (stating that \"in interpreting a treaty it is\n\nproper    .   .     .    to   refer   to    the   records     of   its   drafting      and\n\nnegotiation\"); Islamic Rep. of Iran v. Boeing Co., 771 F.2d 1279,\n\n1283 (9th Cir. 1985) (explaining that the most important factor in\n\ndetermining whether a treaty is self-executing is the language,\n\npurpose, and intent behind the treaty).\n\n              Given the broad judicial inquiry required to determine if\n\na treaty establishes individually enforceable rights and the non-\n\nbinding nature of the Senate's non-self-execution declaration, I do\n\nnot think it proper to affirm the dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(6). See Paust, Avoiding \"Fraudulent\" Executive Policy, supra\n\nat 1259-62 (suggesting that text of ICCPR indicates that it was\n\nintended      to    be    self-executing).          We   do   not   have      before    us\n\nsufficient information concerning the negotiation history of the\n\nICCPR or the way in which the other signatories have enforced it.\n\nWithout such information, we lack the full spectrum of sources\n\nnecessary      to       evaluate   the     extent   to   which,     if   at    all,    the\n\nplaintiffs may possess one or more enforceable rights under the\n\nTreaty.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -107-\n\f            A \"court should be especially reluctant to dismiss on the\n\nbasis of the pleadings when the asserted theory of liability is\n\nnovel or extreme, since it is important that new legal theories be\n\nexplored and assayed in the light of the actual facts rather than\n\na pleader's suppositions.\"    5A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice &\n\nProcedure, § 1357; see also Doe v. Walker, 193 F.3d 42, 46 (1st\n\nCir. 1999)(\"Our preference for a better record is well supported\n\nand . . .    is one which we are entitled to require for reasons of\n\nprudence.\").    When looked at the way I see it, this suit presents\n\na novel claim concerning the right to vote – a right which, as I\n\nhave said, has special significance.    See Wesberry v. Sanders, 376\n\nU.S. 1, 17 (1964) (stating that \"no right is more precious in a\n\nfree country than that of having a voice in the election of those\n\nwho make the laws, under which, as good citizens, we must live\").\n\nGiven the sensitive nature of the dispute and its implications, I\n\nwould permit the parties to develop a record concerning the ICCPR.64\n\n\n     64\n       I am less sanguine about whether plaintiffs may successfully\npress a claim under customary international law.          The most\npromising avenue for challenging Puerto Rico's status as violative\nof a customary international norm -- a claim arguing that customary\ninternational law recognizes a right of peoples to self-\ndetermination and imposes on nations an obligation to decolonize --\nmore properly belongs not to an individual Puerto Rican, but to the\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico itself, the political leadership of\nwhich is elected by individual Puerto Ricans and, presumably, would\nbe responsive to the electorate.     See, e.g., Duke Power Co. v.\nCarolina Env. Study Group, Inc., 438 U.S. 59, 80 (1978); Laurence\nH. Tribe, American Constitutional Law, § 3-19 (3d ed. 2000); Erwin\nChemerinsky, Constitutional Law Principles and Policies, § 2.5.4\n(2d ed. 2002). In such a lawsuit, there would be less reason for\nconcern that the plaintiffs might be seeking a fundamental change\n\n                                -108-\n\fin the relationship between the Commonwealth and the United States\nthat many of their fellow Puerto Ricans may not desire.\n\n                              -109-\n\f",

Panels of this court have rejected such claims on all three occasions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We now do so again, this time <i>en banc,</i> rejecting as well an adjacent claim: that the failure of the Constitution to grant this vote should be declared a violation of U.S. treaty obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional claim is readily answered. Voting for President and Vice President of the United States is governed neither by rhetoric nor intuitive values but by a provision of the Constitution. This provision does not confer the franchise on \"U.S. citizens\" but on \"Electors\" who are to be \"appoint[ed]\" by each \"State,\" in \"such Manner\" as the state legislature may direct, equal to the number of Senators and Representatives to whom the state is entitled. U.S. Const. art. II, &#167; 1, cl. 2; <i>see also id.</i> amend. XII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At one time state legislatures chose the electors themselves, <i>see McPherson v. Blacker,</i> 146 U.S. 1, 28-35, 13 S.Ct. 3, 36 L.Ed. 869 (1892); in the modern manner, customarily a U.S. state provides that its own citizens&#8212;citizens of that state&#8212;vote for the electors to represent that state. Modern ballots may omit the names of the electors and list only the candidates, so in form it appears that citizens are voting for President and Vice President directly. But they are not: they are voting for electors and, more pertinent here, the electors are electors of <i>the states.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico&#8212;like the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam&#8212;is not a \"state\" within the meaning of the Constitution. <i>Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez,</i> 977 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.1992). Puerto Rico was not one of the original 13 states who ratified the Constitution; nor has it been made a state, like the other 37 states added thereafter, pursuant to the process laid down in the Constitution. U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 3, cl. 1. Nor has it been given electors of its own, as was the District of Columbia in the Twenty-Third Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico became associated with the United States as an unincorporated territory under Article IV of the Constitution following the 1898 war between this country and Spain. U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 3, cl. 2; <i>see Insular Cases,</i> 182 U.S. 1, 21 S.Ct. 743, 45 L.Ed. 1041 (1901). Its status has altered over the ensuing period, culminating in an agreement in 1952, approved by the citizens of Puerto Rico, that Puerto Rico should have a unique \"Commonwealth\" status; but the unique status is not statehood within the meaning of the Constitution. <i>see Trailer Marine,</i> 977 F.2d at 7; <i>Igart&#250;a II,</i> 229 F.3d at 87-88 &amp; nn. 15-16 (Torruella, J., concurring). And, in recent elections, Puerto Ricans themselves have been substantially divided as to whether to seek statehood, status. <i>Cf. Rossello-Gonzalez v. Calderon-Serra,</i> 398 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As Puerto Rico has no electors, its citizens do not participate in the presidential voting, although they may do so if they take up residence in one of the 50 states and, of course, they elect the Governor of Puerto Rico, its legislature, and a non-voting delegate to Congress. Like each state's entitlement to two Senators regardless of population, the make-up of the electoral college is a direct consequence of how the framers of the Constitution chose to structure our government&#8212;a choice itself based on political compromise rather than conceptual perfection. Note, <i>Rethinking the Electoral College Debate: The Framers,</i> <i>Federalism, and One Person, One Vote,</i> 114 Harv. L.Rev. 2526, 2526-31 (2001) (discussing historical commentary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the franchise for choosing electors is confined to \"states\" cannot be \"unconstitutional\" because it is what the Constitution itself provides. Hence it does no good to stress how important is \"the right to vote\" for President. Although we recognize the loyalty, contributions, and sacrifices of those who are in common citizens of Puerto Rico and the United States, much the same could have been said about the citizens of the District of Columbia, who were voteless over a much longer period. The path to changing the Constitution lies not through the courts but through the constitutional amending process, U.S. Const. art. V; and the road to statehood&#8212;if that is what Puerto Rico's citizens want&#8212;runs through Congress. U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 3, cl. 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has thrice rejected the constitutional claim now advanced by Igart&#250;a. The Ninth Circuit reached the same result in a similar suit concerning Guam. <i>Attorney General of the Territory of Guam v. United States,</i> 738 F.2d 1017 (9th Cir.1984). The Supreme Court denied certiorari in both <i>Igart&#250;a I,</i> 514 U.S. 1049, 115 S.Ct. 1426, 131 L.Ed.2d 308 (1995), and in the Ninth Circuit case, 469 U.S. 1209, 105 S.Ct. 1174, 84 L.Ed.2d 323 (1985). Igart&#250;a has offered nothing new in this third case to support his constitutional claim. In this <i>en banc</i> decision, we now put the constitutional claim fully at rest: it not only is unsupported by the Constitution but is contrary to its provisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Igart&#250;a's complaint also relied upon U.S. treaties&#8212;technically, two of the three are not treaties&#8212;as a premise for the suffrage right claimed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This theory had been advanced and rejected by this court in <i>Igart&#250;a I,</i> 32 F.3d at 10 n. 1, which was binding on the panel and could not be altered by it. <i>Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds to Go, Inc.,</i> 370 F.3d 151, 160 &amp; n. 4 (1st Cir.2004). After the panel granted rehearing in this case to examine a more elaborate version of the treaty argument, the <i>en banc</i> court determined that the matter should be heard by the full court. Two of the three panel members said that they were content with this course. Only one judge dissented from the proposal to hear the case <i>en banc. See Igart&#250;a de la Rosa,</i> 407 F.3d 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No treaty claim, even if entertained, would permit a court to order that the electoral college be enlarged or reapportioned. Treaties&#8212;sometimes&#8212;have the force of domestic law, just like legislation; but the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and neither a statute nor a treaty can override the Constitution. <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 16-18, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957) (plurality opinion); <i>Matter of Burt,</i> 737 F.2d 1477, 1484 (7th Cir.1984); <i>Plaster v. United States,</i> 720 F.2d 340, 348 (4th Cir.1983) (collecting case law). <i>See also Marbury v. Madison,</i> 5 U.S. (1 Cranch.) 137, 180, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803) (\"a law repugnant to the constitution is void\"). So the treaty claim, originally made in support of injunctive relief, is now recast by proponents as a demand for \"a declaration\" that the United States is in violation of its treaty obligations for failing to \"take steps\" to give a presidential vote to citizens of Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are a host of problems with the treaty claim, including personal standing, redressability, the existence of a cause of action, and the merits of the treaty interpretations offered. Treaties are made between states (in the international usage of that term) and citizens do not automatically have a right to sue upon them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The present claim is also probably not justiciable in the sense that any effective relief could be provided;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it is enough to let common sense play upon the conjecture that the Constitution would be amended if only a federal court declared that a treaty's generalities so required. <i>See Simon,</i> 426 U.S. at 44, 96 S.Ct. 1917 (\"unadorned speculation [as to redress] will not suffice to invoke the federal judicial power\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor are the merits of Igart&#250;a's reading of the treaties at all straightforward. The language of each of the treaties invoked is general. Nothing in them says anything about just who should be entitled to vote for whom, or that an entity with the <i>negotiated</i> relationship that the United States has with Puerto Rico is nevertheless required to adopt some different arrangement as to governance or suffrage. In 1951, Puerto Ricans themselves acceded to their present Commonwealth status,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and they are today divided as to what relationship they would prefer on the spectrum from statehood to Commonwealth status to independence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it unnecessary to plumb these questions, whether of preconditions to suit or the meaning of the treaties, because none of these treaties comprises domestic law of the United States and so their <i>status</i> furnishes the clearest ground for denying declaratory relief. It is well settled that declaratory relief is discretionary, <i>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co.,</i> 515 U.S. 277, 287, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995), but discretion does not mean anything that a judge feels like doing. Rather,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">the discretion to grant declaratory relief is to be exercised with great circumspection when matters of public moment are involved, . . . or when a request for relief threatens to drag a federal court prematurely into constitutional issues that are freighted with uncertainty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Economic Protection Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would not be \"circumspection\" but patent imprudence to \"declare\" purported rights under the treaties at issue in this case. The United States has signed numerous treaties over the years, many containing highly general and ramifying statements. Some as negotiated by the President are merely aspirational and not law in any sense. Others may comprise international commitments, but they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \"self-executing\" and is ratified on these terms. The law to this effect is longstanding. <i>See Whitney v. Robertson,</i> 124 U.S. 190, 194, 8 S.Ct. 456, 31 L.Ed. 386 (1888); <i>Foster v. Neilson,</i> 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 314, 7 L.Ed. 415 (1829) (Marshall, C.J.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The treaties in question here do not adopt any legal obligations binding as a matter of domestic law. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is precatory: that is, it creates aspirational goals but not legal obligations, even as between states. <i>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,</i> 542 U.S. 692, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 2767, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004). This is also true of the Inter-American Democratic Charter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The final instrument, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is a ratified treaty but was submitted and ratified on the express condition that it would be \"not self-executing.\" 138 Cong. Rec. S4781, S4784 (daily ed. Apr. 2, 1992). Indeed, <i>Sosa</i> used it as an example of such a treaty, saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several times, indeed, the Senate has expressly declined to give the federal courts the task of interpreting and applying international human rights law, as when its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights declared that the substantive provisions of the document were not self-executing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">124 S.Ct. at 2763.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever limited room there may be for courts to second-guess the joint position of the President and the Senate that a treaty is not self-executing&#8212;and we are pretty skeptical of such a suggestion in light of \"the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs,\" <i>id.</i>&#8212;it is certainly not present in a case in which the Supreme Court has expressed its own understanding of a specific treaty in the terms block quoted above. Indeed, only a few pages later <i>Sosa</i> repeated: \"[T]he United States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding that it was not self-executing and so did not itself create obligations enforceable in the federal courts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2767.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the President negotiates a precatory agreement or a non-self-executing treaty, and when Congress refuses to adopt implementing legislation for a non-self-executing treaty, both are performing functions entrusted to them by the Constitution. U.S. Const. art. I, &#167;&#167; 1, 8-10; art. II, &#167;&#167; 2-3. It would ignore, and undermine, this constitutional allocation of functions for a federal court to declare that the United States was nevertheless \"violating\" such a treaty. In substance, such an exercise would attempt to do what the President and Congress have declined to do, namely, to deploy the treaty provision in an attempt to order domestic arrangements within the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This intrusive course could also embarrass the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, which is \"committed by the Constitution to the executive and legislative&#8212;`the political'&#8212;departments of the government.\" <i>Oetjen v. Central Leather Co.,</i> 246 U.S. 297, 302, 38 S.Ct. 309, 62 L.Ed. 726 (1918). Whatever the State Department might later say, such a declaration by a federal court of a supposed \"treaty obligation\" could be trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere. This is a legitimate concern in considering whether \"discretion\" should be exercised to grant declaratory relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Of course, no such declaration would confer a presidential vote on Igart&#250;a: it would merely reinforce the disturbing view that judges have no proper notion of where their own authority ends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for giving Puerto Ricans the right to vote in presidential elections is fundamentally a political one and must be made through political means. But the right claimed cannot be implemented by courts unless Puerto Rico becomes a state or until the Constitution is changed (as it has been, at least five times, to broaden the franchise). U.S. Const. amend. XV (race, color, previous servitude); <i>id.</i> amend. XIX (sex); <i>id.</i> amend. XXIII (District of Columbia); <i>id.</i> amend. XXIV (payment of poll or other tax); <i>id.</i> amend. XXVI (age eighteen and older). It certainly should not be \"declared\" by a federal court on the basis of treaties none of which was designed to alter domestic law&#8212;and none of which could override the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little need be said of Igart&#250;a's related claim that customary international law, by itself and independent of treaties, requires that he be allowed to vote for President. Although sometimes said by enthusiasts to be law like other law, customary international law is a diffuse and often highly uncertain body of norms whose force and enforceability vary greatly even in the international sphere; and its status in our domestic courts is even more qualified. <i>See Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2762-63, 2768-69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only recently, in <i>Sosa,</i> the Supreme Court enjoined great caution in importing such norms into domestic law, even in the context of a federal statute governing alien tort actions that arguably authorized some degree of importation by federal courts. <i>Sosa</i> refused to recognize as a norm of customary international law the notion of protection against arbitrary arrest. 124 S.Ct. at 2769. Yet the claim rejected in <i>Sosa</i> was a model of precision compared to Igart&#250;a's present claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No serious argument exists that customary international law, independent of the treaties now invoked, requires a particular form of representative government. Practice among leading democratic nations shows a diversity as to how governments organize and structure the franchise; in Great Britain, for example, neither the head of state nor of government is directly elected by the public at large. If there exists an international norm of democratic government, it is at a level of generality so high as to be unsuitable for importation into domestic law. <i>Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2768 n. 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, other supporters of Igart&#250;a's claim suggest that the United States need not \"amend the Constitution\" to resolve the asserted infirmity of having Puerto Ricans classed as citizens of the United States but unable to vote for President. For example, Puerto Rico could be made a state or, alternatively, could be recognized as an independent nation. Granting the declaration, it is claimed, would encourage the United States to \"take steps\" toward a resolution even if it did not immediately secure a vote for Igart&#250;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is, of course, nothing but speculation, but it further underscores the impropriety of the judicial declaration sought. The main impact of such an abstract declaration, if any, would be to serve partisans in a political campaign as to the choice between statehood, independence, Commonwealth status, or other altered arrangements between Puerto Rico and the United States. Changes to the Constitution and the present status of Puerto Rico are not the province of federal judges, nor are they dictated by international law; those changes can only be adopted as set forth in the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Igartua De La Rosa v.

The two are not in conflict. The majority's opinion recognizes the possible validity of Judge Lipez's belief that the court here lacks jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief. I happen to think Judge Lipez is right, and, if so, that of course ends the matter. But even apart from the correctness of his approach, I agree with Chief Judge Boudin's alternative analysis which leads to the same outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree with the majority's denial of relief to Igart&#250;a.

The dissenting judges present their legal positions in support of those aspirations powerfully and eloquently. Nevertheless, \"[f]ederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction,\" <i>Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.,</i> 511 U.S. 375, 377, 114 S.Ct. 1673, 128 L.Ed.2d 391 (1994), and that limited jurisdiction does not permit us to decide the issues raised by Igart&#250;a's request for declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may seem odd to some that a federal court might not have the power to answer important legal questions involving the interaction between the Constitution, international law, and the rights of American citizens. But, as I will explain below, one cannot simply go to federal court and get an answer to a legal question. Before a federal court can resolve the issues before it, the court must first satisfy itself that, if the plaintiff ultimately won, the decision would probably result in a redress of the plaintiff's grievance. If a judicial victory would probably not produce such a result, the federal court has no power to address the merits of the issues underlying the dispute. In most cases redressability is not a problem. In this case, however, redressability is an insuperable problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the majority ably explains, there are only two methods under our Constitution by which a territory can receive electoral votes: through admission as a state, <i>see</i> U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 3, cl. 1, or by special amendment, <i>see id.</i> amend. XXIII. For all practical purposes, only Congress can perform either of these actions, and whether to do so is in Congress's sole discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, the critical jurisdictional question reduces to whether a court can declare Congress's failure to initiate either of these processes to be a violation of international law&#8212;or, as Judge Torruella puts it, whether a court can issue a declaratory judgment that \"the United States has taken no steps to meet its obligations under the ICCPR and customary international law to grant equal voting rights to all citizens in the election of the President and Vice President of the United States.\" <i>Post</i> at 183-84 (Torruella, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the answer to this jurisdictional question does not turn on the precise contents of the particular agreements at issue; whether the agreements are binding or merely \"precatory\"; whether they have been ratified by the Senate; whether they are self-executing; or even whether the relevant international legal norms derive from agreements at all, as opposed to customary law. Nor does the answer turn on the discretionary nature of a declaratory judgment. Even if those factors were removed, Igart&#250;a's request for declaratory relief would still face an insuperable obstacle: we lack jurisdiction to decide his international law claim because his grievance is not judicially redressable. <i>See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 101, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (court must address Article III jurisdictional questions before addressing merits, because \"[h]ypothetical jurisdiction produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgment&#8212;which comes to the same thing as an advisory opinion\"). Unavoidably, Igart&#250;a's request for a declaratory judgment requires unsupportable speculation about the possibility of a Constitutional amendment or the admission of Puerto Rico as a state. For this reason alone, I conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over his request for declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Article III of the Constitution, \"[t]he judicial Power shall extend\" to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" U.S. Const. art. III, &#167; 2, cl. 1. The Supreme Court has interpreted this \"case or controversy\" requirement to mean, among other things, that federal courts do not issue advisory opinions. In particular, a federal court may only exercise jurisdiction over an action if it is \"`likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,' that the injury will be `redressed by a favorable decision.'\" <i>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,</i> 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (quoting <i>Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org.,</i> 426 U.S. 26, 38, 43, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). If the plaintiff cannot show that his injury \"is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision,\" the federal court's \"exercise of its power . . . would be gratuitous and thus inconsistent with the Art. III limitation.\" <i>Simon,</i> 426 U.S. at 38, 96, S.Ct. 1917. This limitation applies with undiminished force to actions for declaratory judgment. <i>See Calderon v. Ashmus,</i> 523 U.S. 740, 745, 118 S.Ct. 1694, 140 L.Ed.2d 970 (1998) (\"[W]e must first address whether this action for a declaratory judgment is the sort of `Article III' `case or controversy' to which federal courts are limited.\"); <i>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth,</i> 300 U.S. 227, 240, 57 S.Ct. 461, 81 L.Ed. 617 (1937) (The Declaratory Judgment Act \"is operative only in respect to controversies which are such in the constitutional sense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case where a plaintiff claims injury from an allegedly unconstitutional act of Congress. Rather, Igart&#250;a claims injury from Congress's <i>inaction</i> in the face of certain international agreements: its failure to either admit Puerto Rico as a state or to propose a Constitutional amendment allocating electors to Puerto Rico.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Since it is beyond dispute that we could not order Congress to do either of those things, Judge Torruella says that we should issue a declaratory judgment that Congress has not fulfilled its duties under international agreements. Judge Torruella then says that Congress, chastened by this declaration, would voluntarily choose to act&#8212;presumably either by admitting Puerto Rico as a state or proposing an amendment similar to the Twenty-third. In Judge Torruella's view, \"it is substantially likely that a, declaration by this Court that the United States is in violation of international law will result in some form of relief to the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Post</i> at 180 (Torruella, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respectfully, the basis for this speculation about Congress initiating the process of Constitutional amendment or invoking the Constitutional process for the admission of a new state is unexplained. We have already warned about the hazards of such speculation when only statutory changes by a state legislature were at stake. In <i>Biszko v. RIHT Financial Corp.,</i> 758 F.2d 769 (1st Cir.1985), plaintiffs challenged a Rhode Island statute that arguably created market conditions under which plaintiffs could not receive full market value for their shares in a Rhode Island bank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> They argued that their suit was redressable because if the federal court invalidated the statute, \"the Rhode Island legislature would soon be moved, <i>sua sponte</i> or by the persuasive efforts of non-New England banks, to pass a statute permitting [a more competitive market].\" <i>Id.</i> at 773. We described such speculation concerning \"a benefit that [plaintiffs] might gain were the Rhode Island legislature to react in a certain way to a decision by this court\" as \"not merely speculative\" but \"positively chimerical.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a legislative body would be within its rights to ignore the court's decision, and the plaintiff cannot convince the court that it is \"`likely,' as opposed to merely `speculative,'\" <i>Lujan,</i> 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, that the legislature will react in the way that he hopes, the redressability requirement has not been met. <i>Cf. Chicago &amp; S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp.,</i> 333 U.S. 103, 113, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948) (\"[I]f the President may completely disregard the judgment of the court, it would be only because it is one the courts were not authorized to render. Judgments, within the powers vested in courts by the Judiciary Article of the Constitution, may not lawfully be revised, overturned or refused faith and credit by another Department of Government.\"). The cases that Judge Torruella cites for the contrary proposition (that Congress would be \"substantially likely\" to redress Igart&#250;'s grievance in light of a judicial declaration) are easily distinguishable and actually reveal why the redressability requirement prevents declaratory relief here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Torruella relies on <i>Utah v. Evans,</i> 536 U.S. 452, 122 S.Ct. 2191, 153 L.Ed.2d 453 (2002), a dispute ultimately stemming from the Census Bureau's method of calculating population in the 2000 census. The Bureau used a statistical method that calculated the population of Utah as somewhat lower, relative to the population of North Carolina, than if the Bureau had not used that method. <i>See id.</i> at 457-58, 122 S.Ct. 2191. Pursuant to statute, the Bureau's final report was formally transmitted to Congress, and the Clerk of the House of Representatives then transmitted to each state governor \"`a certificate of the number of Representatives to which [that] State [was] entitled.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 461, 122 S.Ct. 2191 (quoting 2 U.S.C. &#167; 2a(b)). Due to the statistical method that the Bureau used, Utah received one less representative, and North Carolina one more representative, than if the Bureau had not used that method. <i>Id.</i> at 458, 122 S.Ct. 2191. After receiving the results, Utah sued the government, arguing that the Bureau's statistical method violated another census-related statute, and sought an injunction ordering the Bureau to reissue its report with different results. <i>Id.</i> at 459, 122 S.Ct. 2191.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">North Carolina intervened, arguing that the case was not justiciable because the relief sought would not redress Utah's grievance. Although North Carolina \"[did] not deny that the courts [could] order the [Bureau] to recalculate the numbers and to recertify the official census result,\" it reasoned that \"Utah suffer[ed], not simply from the lack of a proper census `report' (a document), but more importantly from the lack of the additional congressional Representative to which North Carolina believes itself entitled as a consequence of the filing of that document.\" <i>Id.</i> at 461, 122 S.Ct. 2191. In other words, although the court could order a new census report as Utah requested, a new report would not result in Utah gaining a Representative. That outcome would depend entirely on whether Congress, acting in its unbridled discretion, would choose to reapportion, or just ignore the report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court concluded that the injury cited by Utah was redressable:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]e believe it likely that Utah's victory here would bring about the ultimate relief that Utah seeks. Victory would mean a declaration leading, or an injunction requiring, the Secretary to substitute a new \"report\" for the old one. Should the new report contain a different conclusion about the relative populations of North Carolina and Utah, the relevant calculations and consequent apportionment-related steps would be purely mechanical; and several months would remain prior to the first post-2000 census congressional election. Under these circumstances, it would seem. . . \"substantially likely that the President and other executive and congressional officials would abide by an authoritative interpretation of the census statute. . . .\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 463-64, 122 S.Ct. 2191 (quoting <i>Franklin v.

First, compliance with the actual court order or declaration relating to the need for a new census report \"would be purely mechanical.\" 536 U.S. at 463, 122 S.Ct. 2191. Second, while ultimate redress of Utah's grievance would require discretionary action by elected officials, that action&#8212;recertifying the total number of Representatives for two states&#8212;was of a piece with a process so regular and commonplace that Congress has, in ordinary circumstances, delegated it by statute to the Clerk of the House.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Here, by contrast, the Congressional action envisioned (admitting a state or initiating the process of Constitutional amendment) is exceptional, lengthy, complex, and highly uncertain. Consequently, how Congress would react to a declaration is considerably more speculative here than in <i>Evans.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A second case cited by Judge Torruella, <i>Juda v. United States,</i> 13 Cl.Ct. 667 (1987), relates more directly to international agreements. <i>Juda</i> concerned the status of the Marshall Islands. After World War II, the United States entered into an agreement with the United Nations (UN) to administer the Marshall Islands as a UN trusteeship, in an arrangement designed to be temporary. In the 1970s, the United States decided to terminate the trusteeship and offer the territory a compact of free association. The compact agreement was submitted to a plebiscite, and was resoundingly approved. Congress then enacted, and the President signed, legislation formally adopting the compact. After the President issued an executive order implementing the compact, the UN Trusteeship Council determined that the trusteeship had terminated. <i>See id.</i> at 671-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some years later, Marshall Islander plaintiffs filed a claim against the United States under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1491,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> which had undisputedly applied to the Islands while they were still under the trusteeship. The United States argued, however, that the compact agreement withdrew the government's waiver of sovereign immunity. <i>See</i> 13 Cl.Ct. at 677. The plaintiffs responded that, under the rules applicable to UN trusteeships, the trusteeship had not been validly terminated, and therefore the compact&#8212;which withdrew the government's consent to suit&#8212;never took effect. <i>See id.</i> at 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that failure to terminate the trusteeship properly meant that the compact (and with it the withdrawal of consent to suit) had never taken effect. Rather, the court found that whether \"the Trusteeship Agreement has not been terminated de jure does not resolve the issue of whether the Compact . . . is in effect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 682. Ultimately, the court concluded that the compact <i>did</i> take effect, and therefore that the United States had withdrawn its consent to be sued. <i>See id.</i> at 683, 690. Thus, it dismissed the complaint. <i>Id.</i> at 690.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in a lengthy dictum, the court explained that the trusteeship had in fact <i>not</i> been properly terminated. The court held that the trusteeship could not be formally terminated until the UN Security Council so voted. <i>See id.</i> at 678-82. Some time after the <i>Juda</i> decision issued, the government took the court's advice and formally asked the Security Council to terminate the trusteeship, which it did. <i>See</i> United Nations Security Council Resolution 683 (Dec. 22, 1990). That dictum, and the government's decision to take the court's advice, is the precedent upon which Judge Torruella relies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the <i>Juda</i> court did not \"declare\" anything&#8212;it dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint, did not even mention a declaratory judgment, and is cited by Judge Torruella only for a dictum. More importantly, in <i>Juda</i> there was no dispute that both Congress and the President intended to terminate the trusteeship; indeed, by enacting the compact and issuing an executive order implementing it, the political branches thought they had done exactly that. <i>Juda</i> noted that these actions did not have their intended effect due to a technical misunderstanding of UN procedures, and explained how the elected branches could properly achieve what they had already sought to do. The likelihood that Congress and the President would follow the court's advice was not just \"substantial,\" it was a near certainty. There is nothing remotely approaching such certainty here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no precedent for issuing a declaratory judgment in the circumstances of this case, and for good reason. A declaratory judgment \"is a procedural device that provides a new, noncoercive remedy . . . in cases involving an actual controversy that has not reached the stage at which either party may seek a coercive remedy ... and in cases in which a party <i>who could sue for coercive relief</i> has not yet done so.\" <i>B. Braun Med., Inc. v. Abbott Labs.,</i> 124 F.3d 1419, 1428 (Fed.Cir.1997) (emphasis added). Here, however, no coercive remedy would <i>ever</i> be available. Congress would be perfectly within its rights to ignore whatever a federal court said. The court's declaratory judgment would be, in essence, an advisory opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court explained in a different context:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all civil litigation, the judicial decree is not the end but the means. At the end of the rainbow lies not a judgment, but some action (or cessation of action) by the defendant that the judgment produces&#8212;the payment of damages, or some specific performance, or the termination of some conduct. Redress is sought <i>through</i> the court, but <i>from</i> the defendant. This is no less true of a declaratory judgment suit than of any other action. The real value of the judicial pronouncement&#8212;what makes it a proper judicial resolution of a \"case or controversy\" rather than an advisory opinion&#8212;is in the settling of some dispute <i>which affects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Hewitt v.

Here there is only hope and speculation that Congress, in response to a declaratory judgment about a violation of international law, would invoke cumbersome and contentious processes relating to Constitutional amendments or the admission of a new state to eventually give citizen residents of Puerto Rico the right to vote for President and Vice President. Such hope and speculation does not satisfy the \"case or controversy\" requirement of Article III. On that basis alone, I would decline to exercise jurisdiction over Igart&#250;a's request for declaratory relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> There is an exception, in theory: if two-thirds of state legislatures so request, Congress must convene a Constitutional convention<i>See</i> U.S. Const. art.

The agency's governing statute specifically authorized judicial review of an agency's decision <i>not</i> to take certain action, <i>see</i> 2 U.S.C. &#167; 437g(a)(8)(A), and provided that the district court \"may declare that the dismissal of [a] complaint or the failure to act is contrary to law, and may direct the Commission to conform with such declaration within 30 days,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 437g(a)(8)(C). Thus, <i>Akins</i> involved an administrative agency which Congress placed under unusually close judicial oversight, even extending to the agency's exercise of prosecutorial discretion, for which every declaration was potentially accompanied by a coercive order \"to conform with such declaration within 30 days.\" We are not dealing in this case with a subordinate government agency, created by statute, with carefully crafted provisions for substantive judicial review over the agency's decision to do nothing. Rather, the party whose inaction Igart&#250;a complains of is Congress itself, a coequal branch of government that is Constitutionally free to ignore any potential declaration that it should or must perform various actions entrusted to its sole discretion by the Constitution itself.

This was one of the chief grounds [for the holding in <i>Rassmussen</i>]. . . . But Alaska was a very different case from that of Porto Rico. It was an enormous territory, very sparsely settled, and offering opportunity for immigration and settlement by American citizens. It was on the American continent and within easy reach of the then United States. It involved none of the difficulties which incorporation of the Philippines and Porto Rico presents. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 309, 42 S.Ct. 343 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a prime example of the double standard that has been used by the Court, and concomitantly by Congress, in determining the rights to which the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico are entitled. Unfortunately, it is one which has been repeated since <i>Balzac</i> was decided. <i>See Califano v. Gautier Torres,</i> 435 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 906, 55 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978) (upholding Social Security Act provisions denying benefits to U.S. citizens who move to Puerto Rico); <i>Harris v.

Although, in denying Puerto Ricans the right to trial by jury in <i>Balzac,</i> Chief Justice Taft unequivocally stated that \"[i]t is locality that is determinative of the application of the Constitution in such matters as judicial procedure, and not the status of the people who live in it,\" 258 U.S. at 309, 42 S.Ct. 343, the Supreme Court nevertheless chose to overlook this rule when deciding <i>Kinsella</i> and <i>Reid</i> in the aftermath of the Second World War.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both cases involved challenges to the application of the Uniform Code of Military Justice to women who were tried, convicted and sentenced by court martial for murdering their serviceman husbands, one in Japan (Kinsella), and the other in England (Reid). Neither had the benefit of indictment by grand jury or trial before a petit jury. On the first round, the Court, relying on <i>Balzac,</i> affirmed the validity of both convictions. <i>Kinsella,</i> 351 U.S. at 474-80, 76 S.Ct. 886; <i>Reid,</i> 351 U.S. at 490-91, 76 S.Ct. 880 (relying on <i>Kinsella</i> as establishing validity of military jurisdiction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This outcome was followed by much public stirring, an unsurprising result, considering the number of civilian U.S. citizens who were then attached to the military overseas. The public outcry undoubtedly contributed to their being reheard almost immediately, early in the Court's next term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plurality opinion, reversing the prior outcome, was written by Justice Black. He announced that the reliance placed on the <i>Insular Cases</i> in the first <i>Kinsella</i> opinion was \"misplaced.\" <i>Reid v. Covert,</i> 354 U.S. 1, 13, 77 S.Ct. 1222, 1 L.Ed.2d 1148 (1957). In language reminiscent of Justice Harlan's dissents in the <i>Insular Cases,</i> Justice Black stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The `Insular Cases' can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern <i>temporarily</i> territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship. . . . The concept that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 14, 21 S.Ct. 743 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new outcome in <i>Kinsella</i> and <i>Reid,</i> as well as the reversal of <i>Plessy</i> by <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), accentuate the realpolitik of the civil and political rights of the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico, for it is because of the democratic deficit in the Puerto Rico-United States relationship that Puerto Rico enters its <i>second century</i> of its colonial condition with the United States without any resolution of this conundrum in sight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> Stagnation is inevitable, for there is a political vacuum in the Puerto Rico-United States linkage. No effective political pressure can be exercised by the subjects of this colonial relationship on the national political institutions with power to solve the problem. It is precisely because this discrete population of United States citizens is kept in a voteless state by the national political institutions that have \"plenary powers\" over Puerto Rico that a \"political solution\" is not a realistic option. The opinion of U.S. voters affected by <i>Kinsella</i> and <i>Reid</i> could be heard and felt in Washington, as could that of African-Americans after <i>Plessy,</i> even if they were a numerical minority, because they had a significant political presence that was bound to be listened to sooner or later. There can be little doubt that this political clout was transformed into a judicial result. <i>Cf. supra</i> note 31. Not so with Puerto Rico's U.S. citizens. They have no effective way of influencing the political branches of the national government. Puerto Rico's lone non-voting representative in Congress is a prime example of Puerto Rico's political defenselessness. The political pressure that can be exercised by those who took Chief Justice Taft's advice, and moved to the Mainland, is so diluted in the general population of the United States as to make any political pressure by them exiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This total lack of political power is a fact that is glossed over by the majority when it righteously dictates that Puerto Ricans' \"right to vote in presidential elections is fundamentally a political [issue] and must be [achieved] through political means.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 151. To what \"political means\" is the majority referring? Political means are precisely what the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico lack, and cannot create out of thin air as if by alchemy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only do the national political branches lack incentive to act, but, as illustrated by the majority's views,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> this disincentive has also been manifested in the Third Branch, which, if the truth be told, laid the groundwork for this state of affairs with its decisions in the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac,</i> and continues to perpetuate the inherent inequalities thus created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court therefore has every reason to reconsider the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac.</i> They are the product of an era which is a blot on our national and judicial history. The basis upon which they were premised &#8212; that the United States could hold territories and their inhabitants in a colonial status <i>ad infinitum</i> &#8212; was unprecedented and unauthorized by the Constitution. The interpretation given by the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac</i> to the Constitution permits the perpetuation, without limitation, of a class of citizens unequal in rights to the rest of the body politic, an anachronism that is unsupportable morally, logically or legally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the underpinnings to this doctrine have since been eroded. If there ever were a justification for their outcome based on the expediency of the historical epoch during which they were decided, this justification can no longer be sustained. Since the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac</i> were decided, <i>Plessy</i> has been reversed by <i>Brown,</i> making racial discrimination legally and ethically unacceptable. Discrimination on the basis of locality makes as much sense as such opprobrious conduct based on race. Moreover, the idea, expressed in <i>Balzac,</i> that the right to trial by jury is not a fundamental constitutional right is no longer the law of the land. <i>See Duncan,</i> 391 U.S. at 154, 88 S.Ct. 1444. <i>Balzac's</i> ruling has therefore ceased to be the law of the land.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico is part of the First Circuit. An Article III District Court sits there, providing nearly one-third of the appeals filed before this court, which sits in Puerto Rico at least twice a year, also in the exercise of Article III power. One active judge of this court resides in Puerto Rico and participates in cases that are often of national importance, but is nonetheless disenfranchised from voting for national offices. How can the Constitution be applied in such a Balkanized, arbitrary and irrational manner? <i>See Downes,</i> 182 U.S. at 374, 21 S.Ct. 770 (Fuller, C.J., dissenting) (\"[T]he language of the Constitution is too plain and unambiguous to permit its meaning to be thus influenced.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proposition that Puerto Rico \"belong[s] to . . . but [is] not a part of the United States,\" <i>Downes,</i> 182 U.S. at 287, 21 S.Ct. 770, like the \"separate but equal\" concept endorsed in <i>Plessy,</i> belongs to the Dark Ages of American constitutional law and should be relegated to a period in our history best forgotten.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to vote is a fundamental right, which our Constitution guarantees to all citizens. <i>See, e.g., Bush v.

The Fifth Amendment is fully applicable to the actions of the U.S. government in Puerto Rico. <i>Cf. Examining Bd. of Engineers v. Flores de Otero,</i> 426 U.S. 572, 96 S.Ct. 2264, 49 L.Ed.2d 65 (1976). Although not identical to that of the Fourteenth Amendment, an equal protection component is part of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, and serves to constrain the United States. <i>See Bolling v.

Thus conceived, international law has been an integral part of our constitutional and legal system since the founding of our Nation. <i>See Sosa v.

The importance placed on international law, from the founding of the United States, as a component of the nation's legal system is evident in its Constitution, which authorized Congress \"[t]o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offenses against the Law of Nations,\" U.S. Const. art.

After thanking the gathered delegates for their expressions of solidarity and condolences for the terrorist attacks that had occurred that day against the United States homeland, the Secretary stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important that I remain here for a bit longer in order to be part of the consensus of this new charter on democracy.

Furthermore, in ratifying Article 2, Paragraph 1, the United States agreed that it would \"undertake[ ] to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant . . . without distinction of any kind. . . .\" Most important, and central to the issue before us, the signatory nations committed themselves that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]here not already provided for by existing legislati[on] . . . each State Party. . . <i>undertakes to take necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional processes</i> and with the provisions of the present Covenant, <i>to adopt such legislation or other measures</i> as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the present Covenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> art. 2, para. 2 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to an examination of the United States' obligations under these international instruments and the customary international law to which they contribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

On April, 12, 1992, as required by the Constitution, two-thirds of the United States Senate voted in favor of ratifying the ICCPR. 138 Cong. Rec. S4781, S4783. Under Article VI, Clause 2 of the Constitution, a treaty thus ratified has equal status to an act of Congress. That is, a treaty <i>is</i> law of the United States. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Jordan J. Paust, <i>International Law as Law of the United States</i> 99-105, 120 (2d ed.2002). As with statutes, a later treaty supercedes inconsistent earlier-enacted statute, provided the treaty provision on the subject is self-executing. <i>Whitney v. Robertson,</i> 124 U.S. 190, 194, 8 S.Ct. 456, 31 L.Ed. 386 (1888).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When it ratified the ICCPR, however, the Senate also issued a declaration to the effect that the substantive provisions of the ICCPR would not be self-executing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> 138 Cong. Rec. at S4784. I wholeheartedly agree with Judge Howard's conclusion that this declaration is not binding on this court, and that further inquiry to determine whether the ICCPR is indeed non-self-executing is required. <i>See infra</i> at 184 (Howard, J., dissenting). I will not attempt to restate his sound reasoning here. However, even if this approach is not accepted, this court is not, as explained below, entirely without power to act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the ICCPR were not self-executing, the treaty, <i>qua</i> treaty, could not be invoked by a private citizen as the basis for a court of the United States to order that citizen's full participation in the electoral processes of the United States. <i>See Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2767 (recognizing the internationally-binding nature of the ICCPR, but observing that \"the United States ratified the Covenant on the express understanding that it was not self-executing and so did not itself create obligations enforceable in the federal courts\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a> That is, a court of the United States could not use the requirement, established in Article 25 of the ICCPR, that \"[e]very citizen shall have the right and opportunity . . . to vote,\" as the basis for enforcing an individual's right to participate in the electoral processes of the United States, until such time as there has been municipal implementation of Article 25 by the enactment of intra-national legislation or constitutional provision. Neither could the courts of the United States order that the legislative branch of government live up to the obligations undertaken by the United States to \"adopt such legislation or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to [the right to vote established in Article 25 of the ICCPR].\" ICCPR art. 2, para. 2. Such an intromission would violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers. <i>See Smith &amp; Lee Assocs., Inc. v. City of Taylor,</i> <i>Mich.,</i> 102 F.3d 781, 797 (6th Cir.1996) (\"Federal Courts do have jurisdiction and power to pass upon the constitutionality of Acts of Congress, but we are not aware of any decision extending this power in Federal Courts to order Congress to enact legislation. To do so would constitute encroachment upon the functions of a legislative body and would violate the time-honored principle of separation of powers of the three great departments of our Government.\"). The majority's contentions regarding the trumping of treaty provisions by the Constitution, <i>maj. op.</i> at 148, are thus inapposite, as I recognize the validity of this hierarchy and am not in any way proposing its violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, however, it is an undisputed fact that, contrary to the requirements of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the ICCPR, the United States has taken no steps, to date, to implement the obligations undertaken therein. More directly on point, the United States has not enacted any legislation, passed any constitutional provision, or even put in motion any process directed at nationally enfranchising the nearly four million United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico, notwithstanding its ratification of the ICCPR and the Senate's acknowledgment \"[t]hat the United States understands that this Covenant <i>shall be implemented</i> by the Federal Government.\" 138 Cong. Rec. S4781, S4784 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the United States is not in compliance with the binding obligations it undertook by signing and ratifying the ICCPR. The majority does not and cannot refute this undeniable fact, and, as explained below, the potentially non-self-executing nature of the ICCPR does not preclude our ability to make a declaration to that effect, <i>see infra</i> Part III.C.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

We look to international instruments setting forth \"clear and unambiguous rules,\" <i>Flores,</i> 406 F.3d at 84, and to other indications of widespread compliance motivated by a sense of legal obligation, by the nations of the world to establish the content of customary international law. <i>See id.</i> at 82-84; <i>Restatement</i> &#167; 102(2) (\"Customary international law results from a general and consistent practice of states followed by them from a sense of legal obligation.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ICCPR, the UDHR, the American Declaration, the ACHR and the IADC are all evidence of the emergence of a norm of customary international law with an independent and binding juridical status. <i>See Restatement</i> &#167; 102(3) (\"International agreements . . . may lead to the creation of customary international law when such agreements are intended for adherence by states generally and are in fact widely accepted.\"). The right to equal political participation required by these instruments, as outlined above, is clear and unambiguous. The ICCPR, for example, admits of no doubt when it states that \"[e]very citizen shall have the right and the opportunity . . . [t]o vote . . . at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage . . . .\" ICCPR art. 25. The universal acceptance of this right to equal political participation is demonstrated by the prevalence of the right in a variety of multinational and regional agreements, and by the broad acceptance of those agreements by the countries of the world. Currently, for example, 163 nations of the 191-member United Nations are parties to the ICCPR, with an additional seven signatories that have not yet ratified the treaty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to equal political participation, as evidenced by these international treaties, covenants, and declarations, is reinforced by what has become the overwhelming practice worldwide. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Enrique Lagos &amp; Timothy D.

The international norm at issue here is not \"democratic government\" generally, but the right to vote in equality with all other citizens of one's nation. The majority studiously fails to provide any example, in any democratic country, in which citizens are classified into voting and non-voting categories. Its reference to Great Britain as an example of diversity in democratic governments in which citizens neither vote for the head of state nor directly for the governing party, hardly proves the point or even stands for the proposition that customary international law tolerates unequal voting rights among citizens of the same country. In Great Britain, the monarch is only symbolically the head of state.

The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201(a), provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction . . . any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this Act, this court may declare the rights, under the ICCPR and customary international law, of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico. \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial branch to say what the law is.\" <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803). The Act provides the courts with the option of \"declar[ing] the <i>rights and other legal relations of any interested party</i> seeking such declaration, <i>whether or not further relief</i> is or <i>could be sought.</i>\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201(a) (emphasis added), particularly when a declaratory judgment \"will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling the legal relations in issue. . . .\" <i>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

Redressability</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This type of declaratory relief in the present case is fully consistent with the Declaratory Judgment Act, because it is substantially likely that a declaration by this Court that the United States is in violation of international law will result in some form of relief to the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico. <i>See Utah v. Evans,</i> 536 U.S. 452, 463-464, 122 S.Ct. 2191, 153 L.Ed.2d 453 (2002). In <i>Evans</i> the Court held that the \"redressability\" element of standing under Article III and the Declaratory Judgment Act<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> was met in a situation in which it was \"`substantially likely'\" that a non-party, co-equal branch of government would abide by a federal court's interpretation of the law \"`even though they would not be directly bound by such a determination.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 460, 122 S.Ct. 2191 (quoting <i>Franklin v. Massachusetts,</i> 505 U.S. 788, 803, 112 S.Ct. 2767, 120 L.Ed.2d 636 (1992)). Standing was established because \"the practical consequence of [a court order declaring a census-taking method unlawful] would amount to a significant increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff would obtain relief [from the President] that directly redresses the injury suffered.\" <i>Id.</i> at 464, 122 S.Ct. 2191 (collecting cases in which standing has been found under similar circumstances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in <i>Juda,</i> one can find an example of the legislative branch following the judiciary's interpretation of international law. In that case, the inhabitants of the Marshall Islands &#8212; which the United States held under trusteeship from the United Nations &#8212; challenged the United States' attempt to unilaterally terminate the Trusteeship Agreement by way of Presidential proclamation, which would have contravened the international agreement with the United Nations. The Claims Court declared that the Trusteeship remained in effect <i>de jure</i> as a matter of international law, and set forth the procedure to be followed by the United States to end it under international law. <i>Id.</i> at 678-82. Although not bound by that judicial roadmap, Congress did in fact follow it. <i>See</i> Joint Resolution to Approve the \"Compact of Free Association\" between the United States and the Government of Palau, Pub.L. No. 99-658, &#167; 101, 100 Stat. 3672 (1986); U.N. Security Counsel Res. 683 (Dec. 22, 1990) (terminating Trusteeship Agreement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parallel between these cases and the present situation is self-evident. Judge Lipez's attempt to distinguish them on the basis that \"the likelihood that Congress and the President would follow the court's advice was not just `substantial,' [in those cases], it was a near certainty . . . . [but] [t]here is nothing approaching such certainty here,\" <i>supra</i> at 157 (Lipez, J., concurring), is unconvincing. With due respect, it is the concurrence that engages in speculation. It seems to me that the prediction that Congress would ignore a declaratory judgment of this court that the United States is not in compliance with its international obligations is simply contrary to experience. <i>Juda,</i> whether <i>dicta</i> or not, <i>see supra</i> at 157 (Lipez, J., concurring), bears this out. We live in a country of laws in which the norm is for all branches of government to respect and comply with the decisions of the courts, irrespective of how disputed they may be. <i>See, e.g., Bush v. Gore,</i> 531 U.S. 98, 121 S.Ct. 525, 148 L.Ed.2d 388 (2000). I cannot countenance that Congress &#8212; nor, for that matter, the Executive, which negotiated the ICCPR and is thus intimately involved and committed &#8212; would ignore a judgment of this court declaring that the government has taken no action to comply with an international obligation of the United States, negotiated and agreed to by the Executive Branch with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty, complexity, or length of the process required for the United States to comply with the law of the land is irrelevant, as it has never been a test for redressability of a wrong. <i>Cf. Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) (ordering racial desegregation of schools occur \"with all deliberate speed\"). The U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have waited over one hundred years to regain the voting rights they lost when the U.S. invaded in 1898. A declaratory judgment would be of some help in speeding up the process of recovering these rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless, however, of the inappropriateness and unlikelihood of Congressional inaction in response to a judicial declaration of the rights at issue, it cannot be denied that we lack authority to order Congress to act. Even if Congress chooses to continue on its course of inaction, however, our declaration of the plaintiffs' rights under the ICCPR and customary international law would, itself, provide a form of redress. On this point, <i>Federal Election Commission v. Akins,</i> 524 U.S. 11, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998), is instructive. In <i>Akins,</i> a group of voters filed an administrative complaint with the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\") asking it to force a certain political organization to comply with the reporting requirements for political action committees (\"PACs\"). <i>See id.</i> at 17, 118 S.Ct. 1777. The FEC dismissed the complaint on the ground that the organization did not fit the definition of a PAC under federal law. <i>See id.</i> The voters appealed the FEC's dismissal of their complaint and the FEC defended on the ground that the voters' claim was not redressable. <i>See id.</i> at 19. The FEC argued that, even if it misinterpreted the definition of a PAC, it maintained the option not to act on the voters' complaint as a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <i>See id.</i> at 25, 118 S.Ct. 1777. The Court disagreed that the FEC's discretionary authority deprived the voters of standing. <i>See id.</i> The Court explained that, even though the FEC might ultimately decline to act on the voters' complaint, the voters' injury was redressed by assuring that the FEC's discretionary decision was based on a correct understanding of the relevant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an analogous circumstance. The plaintiffs have alleged that Congress has an obligation under the ICCPR and customary international law to further their right to vote for President and that since the ICCPR was ratified, Congress has taken no action in this regard. It is possible that Congress has not acted in accord with its obligations because it is unaware of them. By issuing a declaration stating the plaintiffs' rights under the ICCPR and customary international law, the court can correct this potential misunderstanding. To be sure, an Article III court cannot order Congress to pass a law, just as it cannot order the executive to prosecute a particular case. But, as in <i>Akins,</i> a declaration can ensure that the government actor in question (here Congress) exercises its responsibility with a correct understanding of the relevant legal principles. This is no guarantee that the Congress will exercise its discretion favorably to the plaintiff. But, as <i>Akins</i> makes clear, there is no such requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 25, 118 S.Ct. 1777; <i>Evans,</i> 536 U.S. at 464, 122 S.Ct. 2191 (stating that redressability is established where court action \"would amount to a significant increase in the likelihood that the plaintiff would obtain the relief that directly redresses the injury suffered\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, I simply do not agree with Judge Lipez's reading of the <i>Utah</i> and <i>Juda</i> cases, nor with his conclusions regarding redressability. Obviously, the ideal remedy would be if we could order that plaintiffs be allowed to vote. Barring a finding that the ICCPR is self-executing, that remedy is not available. Continued non-compliance, however, is a circumstance that cannot be ignored any longer. The honor and credibility of the United States are at stake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-appellants, citizens of the United States, are denied the right to vote for the offices of President and Vice President of our nation in violation of the ICCPR and customary international law. Further, it is an unquestionable fact that the United States has not met its obligation under the ICCPR to take steps toward allowing these citizens to exercise this fundamental right. <i>See</i> ICCPR art. 2, para. 2. It must be assumed that the United States will give effect to a judicial declaration stating its failure to meet its obligations in this respect, and, at a minimum, we must ensure that any future inaction by the government is not based on an inaccurate understanding of its obligations under international law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. \"Embarrassment\" v. Equality</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the majority were to conclude that plaintiffs-appellants' allegations are not supported by the law, although I obviously disagree with this conclusion, I would accept it as part of the judicial process in which diversity of opinion is a fact of judicial review. However, I cannot accept, and am highly disturbed by, the proposition espoused by the majority that the outcome of this appeal should in any way be dictated by its perception that a declaration by this court that the United States has failed to comply with its treaty obligations might \"embarrass\" the United States and \"could be trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 150-51. These statements are worrisome because they demonstrate a misperception of the role of federal courts vis-&#224;-vis treaties and other international law. The interpretation of treaties and international law, as an integral part of the law of the land, is a non-delegable judicial duty and function that cannot be avoided by this court. Indeed, federal courts are the final interpreters of treaties. <i>Juda,</i> 13 Cl.Ct. at 678. The United States is just another party in this case, as it is in the thousands that are heard before the federal courts throughout the nation. It has no higher standing than any other party, and is entitled to no higher privilege than private citizens. It is precisely because the courts of the United States are perceived by the world at large as upholding these high standards of impartiality that a declaration exposing the government's failure to comply with its treaty obligations, rather than \"embarrassing\" the U.S., as the majority suggests, would have a highly salutary effect by showing the world that we practice what we preach: the rule of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Embarrassment indeed! The U.S. <i>should</i> be embarrassed at its denying equal rights to four million of its citizens in this day and age. That fact itself &#8212; particularly in light of the government's intense encouragement of democratic reform in other nations and purported commitment to international instruments that guarantee equal political participation by all citizens &#8212; could be \"trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 150-51. Was it \"embarrassment\" that finally reversed <i>Plessy</i>? If embarrassment is what it takes to give equal rights to the United States citizens of Puerto Rico, maybe a dose is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There comes a point when the courts must intervene to correct a great wrong, particularly one of their own creation, because the political branches of government cannot or will not act. <i>See, e.g., Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873. This case is such a crossroads in history. This court cannot further \"avert its gaze,\" <i>Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2764-65, without becoming an accomplice to this monumental injustice to Puerto Rico's nationally disenfranchised United States citizens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly before the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said: \"As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master.

(authorizing Puerto Rico to enact a constitution for local self-government), and its sequel, Public Law 447, 66 Stat. 327 (1952) (resolution approving Puerto Rico's Constitution), did nothing to change the underlying constitutional status of Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory, subordinated to Congress' plenary powers under the Territorial Clause, U.S. Const., Art. IV, &#167; 3, c. 2. <i>See generally</i> David M. Helfeld, <i>The Historical Prelude to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> 21 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 135 (1952); David M.

The Supremacy Clause and Article III require a court to examine independently the intentions of the treatymakers to decide if a treaty, by its own force, creates individually enforceable rights. While the Senate's preratification view on the matter is entitled to some weight, other facts, including extrinsic evidence concerning the Treaty's negotiation history and international practice under the Treaty, are relevant.

This is a direct result of the Supremacy Clause, which makes treaties part of the \"supreme law of the land\" along with federal statutes, federal common law, and the Constitution itself. U.S. Const. art.

Another would have established two types of treaties: one requiring only action by the President and the Senate, and a second requiring additional action by the House of Representatives. <i>See</i> 2 Farrand, <i>supra</i> at 394. The rejection of these proposals illustrates the Framers' intention that all treaties constitute law under the Supremacy Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a> As James Wilson stated: \"[The Supremacy Clause] will show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure [their] performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry [them] into effect.\" 2 J. Elliot, <i>The Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution</i> 490 (2d ed. 1881).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p183\">\n      <span class=\"num\">183</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expectation that treaties would become operative as domestic law upon ratification is also expressed in the <i>Federalist Papers</i> and the ratification debates within the States. For example, in Federalist No. 22, Alexander Hamilton explained that \"the treaties of the United States, to have any force at all, must be considered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws, be ascertained by judicial determinations.\" <i>The Federalist No.22</i> at 150 (C. Rossiter ed.1961). Similarly, at the North Carolina ratifying convention, one of the Constitution's supporters explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was necessary that treaties should operate as laws on individuals. They ought to be binding upon us the moment they are made. They involve in their nature not only our own rights, but those of foreigners and should be protected by the federal judiciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p185\">\n      <span class=\"num\">185</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4 Elliot, <i>supra</i> at 158. Even those opposing ratification shared in this view. \"Brutus,\" in criticizing Article III, stated that he could \"readily comprehend what is meant by deciding a case under a treaty. For as treaties will be the law of the land, every person who has rights or privileges secured by a treaty, will have the aid of courts in recovering them.\" 16 J. Kaminski and G. Saladino, <i>The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution</i> 172 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p186\">\n      <span class=\"num\">186</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One commentator has summarized the founding period evidence as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p187\">\n      <span class=\"num\">187</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The] historic patterns of expectation demonstrate that most Framers intended all treaties immediately to become binding on the whole nation, superadded to the laws of the land; to be observed by every member of the nation, to be applied by the courts whenever a cause of action arose from or touched upon them; and to prevail over and preemept any existing state action. In these ways, at least, all treaties (to the extent of their grants, guarantees, or obligations) were to be self-executing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p188\">\n      <span class=\"num\">188</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>See</i> J.

Hylton,</i> 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199, 1 L.Ed. 568 (1796). <i>Ware</i> concerned the 1783 Peace Treaty with Great Britain. The plaintiff, a British citizen, claimed that he was owed a debt by a Virginia citizen. <i>See id.</i> at 199-201. The defendant claimed that the debt had been extinguished by a 1777 Virginia statute. <i>See id.</i> The treaty provided, however, that \"creditors, on either side, shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of full value of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 277. The British plaintiff argued that this treaty provision overrode the Virginia statute and reinstated the debt. <i>See id.</i> at 209.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p190\">\n      <span class=\"num\">190</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Justice Iredell, sitting as a circuit judge, considered whether the treaty was operative without the passage of any additional domestic legislation. He recognized that, under the law of Great Britain, a treaty would not be operative domestically without implementing legislation, but that the purpose of the Supremacy Clause was to differentiate the effect of treaties under American law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p191\">\n      <span class=\"num\">191</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this constitution, therefore, so far as a treaty constitutionally is binding, upon principles of moral obligation, it is also, by the vigor of its own authority, to be executed in fact. It would not otherwise be the supreme law, in the new sense provided for, and it was so before, in a moral sense. . . . [W]hen the constitution was ratified, the case as to the treaty in question stood upon the same footing, as if every act constituting an impediment to a creditor's recovery had been expressly repealed, and any further act passed, which the public obligation had before required, if a repeal alone would not have been sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to the Supreme Court, where each Justice wrote his own opinion. No Justice disagreed with Justice Iredell's explanation of the domestic effect of the treaty. <i>See id.</i> at 237 (\"[E]very treaty made by authority of the United States, shall be superior to the constitution and laws of any individual state. . . .\") (Chase, J.). <i>Ware</i> thus supports the view that, when a treaty creates obligations favoring an individual, the individual may enforce the obligation directly in a United States court, even though there is no implementing legislation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> In other words, under American law, treaties can be self-executing. <i>See Head Money Cases,</i> 112 U.S. 580, 598-99, 5 S.Ct. 247, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884) (\"A treaty . . . is a law of the land as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen . . . may be determined. And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice, that court resorts to the treaty for a rule of decision for the case before it as it would to a statute.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion that some treaties are not self-executing first appeared in <i>Foster v. Neilson,</i> 27 U.S. (2 Pet.) 253, 7 L.Ed. 415 (1829), <i>overruled in part by United States v. Percheman,</i> 32 U.S. 51, 7 Pet. 51, 8 L.Ed. 604 (1833) (reinterpreting treaty in light of new evidence regarding meaning of ambiguous term). There, a treaty with Spain, designed to protect private land grants, provided that \"grants shall be ratified and confirmed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 309. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the treaty was not self-executing because, by its terms, it did not establish a right in an individual but rather placed an obligation on the legislative branch to act. <i>See id.</i> at 314. As Chief Justice Marshall explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is consequently to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself, without the aid of any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation import a contract, where either of the parties engages to perform a particular act, the treaty addresses itself to the political, not the judicial department; and the legislature must execute the contract before it can be become a rule for the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Foster</i> rule &#8212; that certain treaties are non-self-executing &#8212; is a judicially-created doctrine. <i>See</i> Henkin, <i>The Ghost of Senator Bricker, supra</i> at 347. Under this doctrine, a court must ascertain whether the instrument was intended by its makers to establish directly enforceable rights, or only to impose an obligation on one of the political branches. <i>See Frolova v. Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,</i> 761 F.2d 370, 373 (7th Cir.1985) (\"Whether a treaty is self-executing is an issue for judicial interpretation.\"); <i>Restatement supra</i> at &#167; 111, cmt. h (\"Whether an agreement is to be given effect without further legislation is an issue that a court must decide when a party seeks to invoke the agreement as law.\"). Such an intent is to be gleaned from the treaty's terms and history. <i>See Diggs v. Richardson,</i> 555 F.2d 848, 851 (D.C.Cir.1976) (stating that, \"[i]n determining whether a treaty is self-executing courts look to the intent of the signatory parties as manifested by the language of the instrument, and if the instrument is uncertain, recourse must be had to the circumstances surrounding its execution\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this constitutional and judicial history, a court ought not quickly conclude that treaties are non-self-executing. <i>Cf. United States v. Li,</i> 206 F.3d 56, 61 (1st Cir.2000) (en banc) (stating that there is a presumption against self-executing treaties under American law).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a> Rather, a court must conduct an independent and searching inquiry into the treaty's purpose. And on this point a declaration by the Senate that a treaty is non-self-executing should not be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those holding a contrary view tend to regard the Senate's power to declare a treaty non-self-executing to be an adjunct of its general power to consent to ratification. <i>See Restatement supra</i> at &#167; 303, cmt. d. There is no doubt that the Senate may hinge its consent to ratify a treaty on a reservation. <i>See Haver v. Yaker,</i> 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 32, 35, 19 L.Ed. 571 (1869). But a reservation is a \"unilateral statement. . . whereby [one party] purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in the application to that State.\" <i>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,</i> art. 2(1)(d) (1969). A reservation thus has an actual effect on the terms of the treaty. <i>See</i> M. Glennon, <i>The Constitutional Power of the United States Senate to Condition Its Consent to Treaties,</i> 67 Chi.-Kent. L.Rev. 533, 542 n. 63 (1991) (citing authority). And the reservation will vitiate the Senate's consent if its terms are not incorporated into the treaty. <i>See</i> Henkin, <i>Foreign Affairs, supra,</i> at 180-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A non-self-execution declaration differs materially from a reservation. <i>See Restatement, supra</i> at &#167; 314, cmt. d. The declaration is not presented to the other international signatories as a request for a modification of the treaty's terms. Rather, it is directed primarily toward United States courts to express \"the sense of the Senate\" that the treaty should not be interpreted to establish individually enforceable rights. As two leading commentators have explained, the Senate does not have the power to bind a court to such declarations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Senate lacks the constitutional authority to declare the non-self-executing character of a treaty with binding effect on U.S. courts. The Senate has the unicameral power only to consent to ratification of treaties, not to pass domestic legislation. A declaration is not part of a treaty in the sense of modifying the legal obligations created by it. A declaration is merely an expression of an interpretation or of a policy or position. U.S. courts are bound by the Constitution to apply treaties as the law of the land. They are not bound to apply expressions of opinion adopted by the Senate (and concurred in by the President). The courts must undertake their own examination of the terms and context of each provision in a treaty to which the United States is a party and decide whether it is self-executing. The treaty is law. The Senate's declaration is not law. The Senate does not have the power to make law outside the treaty instrument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S. Riesenfeld &amp; F. Abbott, <i>Foreword: Symposium of Parliamentary Participation in the Making and Operation of Treaties,</i> 67 Chi.-Kent L.Rev. 293, 296-97 (1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stated differently, the Senate's power under Article II extends only to the making of reservations that require changes to a treaty before the Senate's consent will be efficacious. A declaration that only has domestic effect is, in reality, an attempt to legislate concerning the internal implementation of a treaty. But the power to legislate is not granted to the Senate under Article II. Legislation may only be enacted through bicameral adoption and presentation to the President as set forth in Article I. <i>See INS v. Chadha,</i> 462 U.S. 919, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 77 L.Ed.2d 317 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only case that I am aware of that addresses a similar question supports this view. In <i>Power Authority of New York v. Federal Power Commission,</i> 247 F.2d 538 (D.C.Cir.), <i>vacated and remanded with instructions to dismiss as moot</i> 355 U.S. 64, 78 S.Ct. 141, 2 L.Ed.2d 107 (1957), the United States entered a bilateral treaty with Canada concerning the use of the Niagara River to produce power along the United States/Canada border. <i>See id.</i> at 539. In its resolution consenting to the treaty, the Senate included a reservation whereby the United States reserved the right to redevelop its portion of the power generated on the river only through an act of Congress. <i>See id.</i> The United States and Canada agreed that the reservation only concerned American domestic law and did not require any changes to the treaty. <i>See id.</i> at 540-41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Power Authority of the State of New York sought a license from the Federal Power Commission to use the Niagara River for the state's anticipated power project. <i>See id.</i> at 539. The Commission dismissed the authority's license application, contending that the Senate's reservation precluded it from granting such a license because federal legislation was required. <i>See id.</i> at 539-40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The D.C. Circuit held that the reservation was ineffective because it involved only United States domestic law. For the reservation to be binding on the judiciary, the court reasoned, it had to constitute an actual part of the treaty:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A true reservation which becomes a part of a treaty is one which alters the effect of the treaty insofar as it may apply in the relations of the State with the other State or States which may be parties to the treaty. It creates a different relationship between the parties and varies the obligations of the parties proposing it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 541. Because the reservation was merely an expression of the Senate's view of domestic policy it had no domestic effect. <i>See id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The non-self-execution declaration in the ICCPR is a similar expression of the Senate's desire concerning a purely domestic issue. Like the reservation in <i>Power Authority,</i> the declaration was not intended to modify the Treaty terms in any way. Thus, it lacks binding force. <i>Cf. Fourteen Diamond Rings v. United States,</i> 183 U.S. 176, 178-80, 22 S.Ct. 59, 46 L.Ed. 138 (holding that a Senate resolution purporting to interpret a treaty adopted after ratification was not binding). Of course, the Senate's view is relevant. <i>Cf. United States v. Stuart,</i> 489 U.S. 353, 366-67, 109 S.Ct. 1183, 103 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989) (stating that Senate preratification debate is relevant to determining the meaning of a treaty). But, in the end, whether there is a private right of action under the ICCPR should be decided on the basis of the <i>totality</i> of available evidence. <i>See Volkswagenwerk v. Schlunk,</i> 486 U.S. 694, 700, 108 S.Ct. 2104, 100 L.Ed.2d 722 (1988) (\"Treaties are construed more liberally than private agreements, and to ascertain their meaning we may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.\"); <i>see also Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v.

Saks,</i> 470 U.S. 392, 400, 105 S.Ct. 1338, 84 L.Ed.2d 289 (1985) (stating that \"in interpreting a treaty it is proper. . . to refer to the records of its drafting and negotiation\"); <i>Islamic Rep. of Iran v. Boeing Co.,</i> 771 F.2d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir. 1985) (explaining that the most important factor in determining whether a treaty is self-executing is the language, purpose, and intent behind the treaty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the broad judicial inquiry required to determine if a treaty establishes individually enforceable rights and the non-binding nature of the Senate's non-self-execution declaration, I do not think it proper to affirm the dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>See</i> Paust, <i>Avoiding \"Fraudulent\" Executive Policy, supra</i> at 1259-62 (suggesting that text of ICCPR indicates that it was intended to be self-executing). We do not have before us sufficient information concerning the negotiation history of the ICCPR or the way in which the other signatories have enforced it.

That case involved whether the right to be free from arbitrary abduction and detention was protected under customary international law. The plaintiff in Sosa did not sue directly under the ICCPR but rather argued that the Treaty's terms helped establish the relevant principle of customary international law for purposes of his Alien Tort Act claim. The Court relied on the Senate's non-self-execution declaration in the ICCPR as one factor to support its conclusion that the ICCPR could not, by itself, establish a rule of customary international law. <i>See id.</i> at 2763 &amp; 2767. But the Court was not faced with (and did not decide) whether the Senate's declaration <i>ipso facto</i> prevents a plaintiff from suing directly under the Treaty. Because the question in Sosa was not the binding effect of the Senate's non-self-execution declaration in determining whether the ICCPR establishes a private cause of action, the parties did not present the Court with (and it did not address) the separation of powers arguments questioning the Senate's authority to issue such declarations. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Reply Brief of United States at 8, <i>Sosa, supra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn64\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64_ref\">64</a>\n        <p> I am less sanguine about whether plaintiffs may successfully press a claim under customary international law.

Panels of this court have rejected such claims on all three occasions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We now do so again, this time <i>en banc,</i> rejecting as well an adjacent claim: that the failure of the Constitution to grant this vote should be declared a violation of U.S. treaty obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutional claim is readily answered. Voting for President and Vice President of the United States is governed neither by rhetoric nor intuitive values but by a provision of the Constitution. This provision does not confer the franchise on \"U.S. citizens\" but on \"Electors\" who are to be \"appoint[ed]\" by each \"State,\" in \"such Manner\" as the state legislature may direct, equal to the number of Senators and Representatives to whom the state is entitled. U.S. Const. art. II, &#167; 1, cl. 2; <i>see also id.</i> amend.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span> (1892); in the modern manner, customarily a U.S. state provides that its own citizens&#8212;citizens of that state&#8212;vote for the electors to represent that state. Modern ballots may omit the names of the electors and list only the candidates, so in form it appears that citizens are voting for President and Vice President directly. But they are not: they are voting for electors and, more pertinent here, the electors are electors of <i>the states.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Puerto Rico&#8212;like the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, and Guam&#8212;is not a \"state\" within the meaning of the Constitution. <i>Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v.

Puerto Rico was not one of the original 13 states who ratified the Constitution; nor has it been made a state, like the other 37 states added thereafter, pursuant to the process laid down in the Constitution.

Its status has altered over the ensuing period, culminating in an agreement in 1952, approved by the citizens of Puerto Rico, that Puerto Rico should have a unique \"Commonwealth\" status; but the unique status is not statehood within the meaning of the Constitution. <i>see Trailer Marine,</i> 977 F.2d at 7; <i>Igart&#250;a II,</i> 229 F.3d at 87-88 &amp; nn. 15-16 (Torruella, J., concurring). And, in recent elections, Puerto Ricans themselves have been substantially divided as to whether to seek statehood, status. <i>Cf. Rossello-Gonzalez v.

Like each state's entitlement to two Senators regardless of population, the make-up of the electoral college is a direct consequence of how the framers of the Constitution chose to structure our government&#8212;a choice itself based on political compromise rather than conceptual perfection. Note, <i>Rethinking the Electoral College Debate: The Framers,</i> <i>Federalism, and One Person, One Vote,</i> 114 Harv.

Hence it does no good to stress how important is \"the right to vote\" for President. Although we recognize the loyalty, contributions, and sacrifices of those who are in common citizens of Puerto Rico and the United States, much the same could have been said about the citizens of the District of Columbia, who were voteless over a much longer period. The path to changing the Constitution lies not through the courts but through the constitutional amending process, U.S. Const. art. V; and the road to statehood&#8212;if that is what Puerto Rico's citizens want&#8212;runs through Congress. U.S. Const. art.

After the panel granted rehearing in this case to examine a more elaborate version of the treaty argument, the <i>en banc</i> court determined that the matter should be heard by the full court. Two of the three panel members said that they were content with this course. Only one judge dissented from the proposal to hear the case <i>en banc.

The language of each of the treaties invoked is general. Nothing in them says anything about just who should be entitled to vote for whom, or that an entity with the <i>negotiated</i> relationship that the United States has with Puerto Rico is nevertheless required to adopt some different arrangement as to governance or suffrage. In 1951, Puerto Ricans themselves acceded to their present Commonwealth status,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and they are today divided as to what relationship they would prefer on the spectrum from statehood to Commonwealth status to independence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it unnecessary to plumb these questions, whether of preconditions to suit or the meaning of the treaties, because none of these treaties comprises domestic law of the United States and so their <i>status</i> furnishes the clearest ground for denying declaratory relief.

Others may comprise international commitments, but they are not domestic law unless Congress has either enacted implementing statutes or the treaty itself conveys an intention that it be \"self-executing\" and is ratified on these terms.

It would ignore, and undermine, this constitutional allocation of functions for a federal court to declare that the United States was nevertheless \"violating\" such a treaty.

Whatever the State Department might later say, such a declaration by a federal court of a supposed \"treaty obligation\" could be trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere. This is a legitimate concern in considering whether \"discretion\" should be exercised to grant declaratory relief.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Of course, no such declaration would confer a presidential vote on Igart&#250;a: it would merely reinforce the disturbing view that judges have no proper notion of where their own authority ends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for giving Puerto Ricans the right to vote in presidential elections is fundamentally a political one and must be made through political means. But the right claimed cannot be implemented by courts unless Puerto Rico becomes a state or until the Constitution is changed (as it has been, at least five times, to broaden the franchise). U.S. Const. amend. XV (race, color, previous servitude); <i>id.</i> amend. XIX (sex); <i>id.</i> amend. XXIII (District of Columbia); <i>id.</i> amend. XXIV (payment of poll or other tax); <i>id.</i> amend. XXVI (age eighteen and older). It certainly should not be \"declared\" by a federal court on the basis of treaties none of which was designed to alter domestic law&#8212;and none of which could override the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Little need be said of Igart&#250;a's related claim that customary international law, by itself and independent of treaties, requires that he be allowed to vote for President. Although sometimes said by enthusiasts to be law like other law, customary international law is a diffuse and often highly uncertain body of norms whose force and enforceability vary greatly even in the international sphere; and its status in our domestic courts is even more qualified. <i>See Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2762-63, 2768-69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only recently, in <i>Sosa,</i> the Supreme Court enjoined great caution in importing such norms into domestic law, even in the context of a federal statute governing alien tort actions that arguably authorized some degree of importation by federal courts. <i>Sosa</i> refused to recognize as a norm of customary international law the notion of protection against arbitrary arrest. 124 S.Ct. at 2769. Yet the claim rejected in <i>Sosa</i> was a model of precision compared to Igart&#250;a's present claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No serious argument exists that customary international law, independent of the treaties now invoked, requires a particular form of representative government. Practice among leading democratic nations shows a diversity as to how governments organize and structure the franchise; in Great Britain, for example, neither the head of state nor of government is directly elected by the public at large. If there exists an international norm of democratic government, it is at a level of generality so high as to be unsuitable for importation into domestic law. <i>Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2768 n. 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, other supporters of Igart&#250;a's claim suggest that the United States need not \"amend the Constitution\" to resolve the asserted infirmity of having Puerto Ricans classed as citizens of the United States but unable to vote for President. For example, Puerto Rico could be made a state or, alternatively, could be recognized as an independent nation. Granting the declaration, it is claimed, would encourage the United States to \"take steps\" toward a resolution even if it did not immediately secure a vote for Igart&#250;a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is, of course, nothing but speculation, but it further underscores the impropriety of the judicial declaration sought. The main impact of such an abstract declaration, if any, would be to serve partisans in a political campaign as to the choice between statehood, independence, Commonwealth status, or other altered arrangements between Puerto Rico and the United States. Changes to the Constitution and the present status of Puerto Rico are not the province of federal judges, nor are they dictated by international law; those changes can only be adopted as set forth in the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> <i>Igartua De La Rosa v.

But, as I will explain below, one cannot simply go to federal court and get an answer to a legal question. Before a federal court can resolve the issues before it, the court must first satisfy itself that, if the plaintiff ultimately won, the decision would probably result in a redress of the plaintiff's grievance. If a judicial victory would probably not produce such a result, the federal court has no power to address the merits of the issues underlying the dispute. In most cases redressability is not a problem. In this case, however, redressability is an insuperable problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the majority ably explains, there are only two methods under our Constitution by which a territory can receive electoral votes: through admission as a state, <i>see</i> U.S. Const. art. IV, &#167; 3, cl. 1, or by special amendment, <i>see id.</i> amend. XXIII. For all practical purposes, only Congress can perform either of these actions, and whether to do so is in Congress's sole discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Thus, the critical jurisdictional question reduces to whether a court can declare Congress's failure to initiate either of these processes to be a violation of international law&#8212;or, as Judge Torruella puts it, whether a court can issue a declaratory judgment that \"the United States has taken no steps to meet its obligations under the ICCPR and customary international law to grant equal voting rights to all citizens in the election of the President and Vice President of the United States.\" <i>Post</i> at 183-84 (Torruella, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the answer to this jurisdictional question does not turn on the precise contents of the particular agreements at issue; whether the agreements are binding or merely \"precatory\"; whether they have been ratified by the Senate; whether they are self-executing; or even whether the relevant international legal norms derive from agreements at all, as opposed to customary law. Nor does the answer turn on the discretionary nature of a declaratory judgment. Even if those factors were removed, Igart&#250;a's request for declaratory relief would still face an insuperable obstacle: we lack jurisdiction to decide his international law claim because his grievance is not judicially redressable. <i>See Steel Co. v.

Judge Torruella then says that Congress, chastened by this declaration, would voluntarily choose to act&#8212;presumably either by admitting Puerto Rico as a state or proposing an amendment similar to the Twenty-third. In Judge Torruella's view, \"it is substantially likely that a, declaration by this Court that the United States is in violation of international law will result in some form of relief to the United States citizens who reside in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Post</i> at 180 (Torruella, J., dissenting).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respectfully, the basis for this speculation about Congress initiating the process of Constitutional amendment or invoking the Constitutional process for the admission of a new state is unexplained.

Second, while ultimate redress of Utah's grievance would require discretionary action by elected officials, that action&#8212;recertifying the total number of Representatives for two states&#8212;was of a piece with a process so regular and commonplace that Congress has, in ordinary circumstances, delegated it by statute to the Clerk of the House.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Here, by contrast, the Congressional action envisioned (admitting a state or initiating the process of Constitutional amendment) is exceptional, lengthy, complex, and highly uncertain.

United States,</i> 13 Cl.Ct. 667 (1987), relates more directly to international agreements. <i>Juda</i> concerned the status of the Marshall Islands. After World War II, the United States entered into an agreement with the United Nations (UN) to administer the Marshall Islands as a UN trusteeship, in an arrangement designed to be temporary. In the 1970s, the United States decided to terminate the trusteeship and offer the territory a compact of free association. The compact agreement was submitted to a plebiscite, and was resoundingly approved. Congress then enacted, and the President signed, legislation formally adopting the compact. After the President issued an executive order implementing the compact, the UN Trusteeship Council determined that the trusteeship had terminated. <i>See id.</i> at 671-76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some years later, Marshall Islander plaintiffs filed a claim against the United States under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1491,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> which had undisputedly applied to the Islands while they were still under the trusteeship. The United States argued, however, that the compact agreement withdrew the government's waiver of sovereign immunity. <i>See</i> 13 Cl.Ct. at 677. The plaintiffs responded that, under the rules applicable to UN trusteeships, the trusteeship had not been validly terminated, and therefore the compact&#8212;which withdrew the government's consent to suit&#8212;never took effect. <i>See id.</i> at 678.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that failure to terminate the trusteeship properly meant that the compact (and with it the withdrawal of consent to suit) had never taken effect. Rather, the court found that whether \"the Trusteeship Agreement has not been terminated de jure does not resolve the issue of whether the Compact . . . is in effect.\" <i>Id.</i> at 682. Ultimately, the court concluded that the compact <i>did</i> take effect, and therefore that the United States had withdrawn its consent to be sued. <i>See id.</i> at 683, 690. Thus, it dismissed the complaint. <i>Id.</i> at 690.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in a lengthy dictum, the court explained that the trusteeship had in fact <i>not</i> been properly terminated. The court held that the trusteeship could not be formally terminated until the UN Security Council so voted. <i>See id.</i> at 678-82. Some time after the <i>Juda</i> decision issued, the government took the court's advice and formally asked the Security Council to terminate the trusteeship, which it did. <i>See</i> United Nations Security Council Resolution 683 (Dec. 22, 1990). That dictum, and the government's decision to take the court's advice, is the precedent upon which Judge Torruella relies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet the <i>Juda</i> court did not \"declare\" anything&#8212;it dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint, did not even mention a declaratory judgment, and is cited by Judge Torruella only for a dictum. More importantly, in <i>Juda</i> there was no dispute that both Congress and the President intended to terminate the trusteeship; indeed, by enacting the compact and issuing an executive order implementing it, the political branches thought they had done exactly that. <i>Juda</i> noted that these actions did not have their intended effect due to a technical misunderstanding of UN procedures, and explained how the elected branches could properly achieve what they had already sought to do. The likelihood that Congress and the President would follow the court's advice was not just \"substantial,\" it was a near certainty. There is nothing remotely approaching such certainty here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no precedent for issuing a declaratory judgment in the circumstances of this case, and for good reason. A declaratory judgment \"is a procedural device that provides a new, noncoercive remedy . . . in cases involving an actual controversy that has not reached the stage at which either party may seek a coercive remedy ... and in cases in which a party <i>who could sue for coercive relief</i> has not yet done so.\" <i>B.

The political pressure that can be exercised by those who took Chief Justice Taft's advice, and moved to the Mainland, is so diluted in the general population of the United States as to make any political pressure by them exiguous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This total lack of political power is a fact that is glossed over by the majority when it righteously dictates that Puerto Ricans' \"right to vote in presidential elections is fundamentally a political [issue] and must be [achieved] through political means.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 151. To what \"political means\" is the majority referring? Political means are precisely what the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico lack, and cannot create out of thin air as if by alchemy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only do the national political branches lack incentive to act, but, as illustrated by the majority's views,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> this disincentive has also been manifested in the Third Branch, which, if the truth be told, laid the groundwork for this state of affairs with its decisions in the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac,</i> and continues to perpetuate the inherent inequalities thus created.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court therefore has every reason to reconsider the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac.</i> They are the product of an era which is a blot on our national and judicial history. The basis upon which they were premised &#8212; that the United States could hold territories and their inhabitants in a colonial status <i>ad infinitum</i> &#8212; was unprecedented and unauthorized by the Constitution. The interpretation given by the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac</i> to the Constitution permits the perpetuation, without limitation, of a class of citizens unequal in rights to the rest of the body politic, an anachronism that is unsupportable morally, logically or legally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the underpinnings to this doctrine have since been eroded. If there ever were a justification for their outcome based on the expediency of the historical epoch during which they were decided, this justification can no longer be sustained. Since the <i>Insular Cases</i> and <i>Balzac</i> were decided, <i>Plessy</i> has been reversed by <i>Brown,</i> making racial discrimination legally and ethically unacceptable. Discrimination on the basis of locality makes as much sense as such opprobrious conduct based on race. Moreover, the idea, expressed in <i>Balzac,</i> that the right to trial by jury is not a fundamental constitutional right is no longer the law of the land. <i>See Duncan,</i> 391 U.S. at 154, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

I wholeheartedly agree with Judge Howard's conclusion that this declaration is not binding on this court, and that further inquiry to determine whether the ICCPR is indeed non-self-executing is required. <i>See infra</i> at 184 (Howard, J., dissenting).

Neither could the courts of the United States order that the legislative branch of government live up to the obligations undertaken by the United States to \"adopt such legislation or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to [the right to vote established in Article 25 of the ICCPR].\" ICCPR art. 2, para. 2.

Rec. S4781, S4784 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the United States is not in compliance with the binding obligations it undertook by signing and ratifying the ICCPR.

Although the Alien Tort Statute grants jurisdiction only over \"causes where an alien sues for a tort only in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States,\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1350, the <i>Sosa</i> court did not foreclose the possibility of directly enforcing some customary international law claims through the federal common law when federal jurisdiction is based on other grounds. <i>See Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2765, n. 19 (expressing doubt, but leaving open possibility of common law claims for violation of customary international law when jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331); <i>cf. id.</i> at 2761 (noting that, at least under Alien Tort Statute, no legal development \"has categorically precluded federal courts from recognizing a claim under the law of nations as an element of common law\"). In light of legislative history that indicates Congress's intent to extend federal jurisdiction over cases \"arising under\" federal law to the fullest extent the Constitution would allow, <i>see</i> 2 Cong. Rec. 4986-87 (1874) (\"The [Judiciary] [A]ct of 1789 did not confer the whole [judicial] power which the Constitution conferred. . . . This bill does. . . . This bill gives precisely the power which the Constitution confers &#8212; nothing more, nothing less.\"), we should conclude that the jurisdiction conferred by 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 can encompass claims arising under customary international law as incorporated into the federal common law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court limited recognizable claims, however, to \"a narrow class of international norms.\" <i>Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2764. Specifically, \"courts should require any claim based on the present-day law of nations to rest on a norm [1] of international character [2] accepted by the civilized world and [3] defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms\" that were recognized at that time as actionable violations of the law of nations. <i>Id.</i> at 2761-62. These were violations of international law that \"admitt[ed] of a judicial remedy and at the same time threaten[ed] serious consequences in international affairs,\" such as the 18th-century prohibitions on violation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy. <i>Id.</i> at 2756.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As established above, the first two requirements &#8212; international character and broad acceptance &#8212; have been met in the case of the customary international law requirement that citizens be permitted full and equal participation in their government. Furthermore, this norm is defined with a specificity comparable to the international law norms recognized as actionable at the founding of our nation. Its requirements are clear and definite,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a> and the failure to fulfill it can indeed threaten serious consequences in international affairs, as evidenced by the pressure exerted by the United States and other governments on non-democratic regimes abroad. <i>Cf.</i> Case 11.204, Inter-Am. C.H.R. 727, OEA/ser.L/V/II.118, doc. 5 rev. 2 (2003) (finding by Inter-American Commission of Human Rights that the United States \"is responsible for violations of Petitioners' rights under Articles II and XX of the American Declaration by denying [citizens of the District of Columbia] an effective opportunity to participate in their federal legislature\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the right to equal political participation by all citizens meets all of the elements required of an enforceable norm of customary international law, there should be no question that it is incorporated into the domestic law of the United States as federal common law to be applied by the federal courts. <i>See Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2764-65. Moreover, it is clear that the United States is in violation of that norm with respect to the residents of Puerto Rico. Were we to avoid this conclusion, we would not just be \"avert[ing] [our] gaze entirely from [an] international norm intended to protect individuals,\" <i>id.,</i> but would be placing our heads into the sand to avoid seeing the obvious.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the majority's refusal to incorporate the clear and specific customary international law norm requiring equal political participation into federal common law contravenes both the specific language of the Constitution, <i>see</i> U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, and relevant Supreme Court doctrine, <i>see Sosa,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 2761-62.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's concern that customary international law is a \"diffuse and often highly uncertain body of norms,\" <i>maj. op.</i> at 13, if true regarding other areas of customary international law, is certainly not true of the right to vote, as demonstrated above. Moreover, the majority's contention that \"[i]f there exists an international norm of democratic government, it is at a level of generality so high as to be unsuitable for importation into domestic law,\" <i>maj. op.</i> at 14, misses the point. The international norm at issue here is not \"democratic government\" generally, but the right to vote in equality with all other citizens of one's nation. The majority studiously fails to provide any example, in any democratic country, in which citizens are classified into voting and non-voting categories. Its reference to Great Britain as an example of diversity in democratic governments in which citizens neither vote for the head of state nor directly for the governing party, hardly proves the point or even stands for the proposition that customary international law tolerates unequal voting rights among citizens of the same country. In Great Britain, the monarch is only symbolically the head of state. Furthermore, I was under the impression that in 1776 we rejected Great Britain's views regarding colonial government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Remedy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We commence with the premise that plaintiffs-appellants have the right to equal political participation as citizens of the United States, pursuant to customary international law and the ICCPR, both of which are binding on the United States.

In that case, the inhabitants of the Marshall Islands &#8212; which the United States held under trusteeship from the United Nations &#8212; challenged the United States' attempt to unilaterally terminate the Trusteeship Agreement by way of Presidential proclamation, which would have contravened the international agreement with the United Nations. The Claims Court declared that the Trusteeship remained in effect <i>de jure</i> as a matter of international law, and set forth the procedure to be followed by the United States to end it under international law. <i>Id.</i> at 678-82. Although not bound by that judicial roadmap, Congress did in fact follow it. <i>See</i> Joint Resolution to Approve the \"Compact of Free Association\" between the United States and the Government of Palau, Pub.L. No. 99-658, &#167; 101, 100 Stat. 3672 (1986); U.N.

Judge Lipez's attempt to distinguish them on the basis that \"the likelihood that Congress and the President would follow the court's advice was not just `substantial,' [in those cases], it was a near certainty . . . . [but] [t]here is nothing approaching such certainty here,\" <i>supra</i> at 157 (Lipez, J., concurring), is unconvincing. With due respect, it is the concurrence that engages in speculation. It seems to me that the prediction that Congress would ignore a declaratory judgment of this court that the United States is not in compliance with its international obligations is simply contrary to experience. <i>Juda,</i> whether <i>dicta</i> or not, <i>see supra</i> at 157 (Lipez, J., concurring), bears this out. We live in a country of laws in which the norm is for all branches of government to respect and comply with the decisions of the courts, irrespective of how disputed they may be. <i>See, e.g., Bush v. Gore,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span> (2000). I cannot countenance that Congress &#8212; nor, for that matter, the Executive, which negotiated the ICCPR and is thus intimately involved and committed &#8212; would ignore a judgment of this court declaring that the government has taken no action to comply with an international obligation of the United States, negotiated and agreed to by the Executive Branch with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty, complexity, or length of the process required for the United States to comply with the law of the land is irrelevant, as it has never been a test for redressability of a wrong. <i>Cf. Brown v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 301, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have waited over one hundred years to regain the voting rights they lost when the U.S. invaded in 1898. A declaratory judgment would be of some help in speeding up the process of recovering these rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless, however, of the inappropriateness and unlikelihood of Congressional inaction in response to a judicial declaration of the rights at issue, it cannot be denied that we lack authority to order Congress to act. Even if Congress chooses to continue on its course of inaction, however, our declaration of the plaintiffs' rights under the ICCPR and customary international law would, itself, provide a form of redress. On this point, <i>Federal Election Commission v. Akins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span> (1998), is instructive. In <i>Akins,</i> a group of voters filed an administrative complaint with the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\") asking it to force a certain political organization to comply with the reporting requirements for political action committees (\"PACs\"). <i>See id.</i> at 17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1777</span></a></span>. The FEC dismissed the complaint on the ground that the organization did not fit the definition of a PAC under federal law. <i>See id.</i> The voters appealed the FEC's dismissal of their complaint and the FEC defended on the ground that the voters' claim was not redressable. <i>See id.</i> at 19. The FEC argued that, even if it misinterpreted the definition of a PAC, it maintained the option not to act on the voters' complaint as a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <i>See id.</i> at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1777</span></a></span>. The Court disagreed that the FEC's discretionary authority deprived the voters of standing. <i>See id.</i> The Court explained that, even though the FEC might ultimately decline to act on the voters' complaint, the voters' injury was redressed by assuring that the FEC's discretionary decision was based on a correct understanding of the relevant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents an analogous circumstance. The plaintiffs have alleged that Congress has an obligation under the ICCPR and customary international law to further their right to vote for President and that since the ICCPR was ratified, Congress has taken no action in this regard. It is possible that Congress has not acted in accord with its obligations because it is unaware of them. By issuing a declaration stating the plaintiffs' rights under the ICCPR and customary international law, the court can correct this potential misunderstanding. To be sure, an Article III court cannot order Congress to pass a law, just as it cannot order the executive to prosecute a particular case. But, as in <i>Akins,</i> a declaration can ensure that the government actor in question (here Congress) exercises its responsibility with a correct understanding of the relevant legal principles. This is no guarantee that the Congress will exercise its discretion favorably to the plaintiff. But, as <i>Akins</i> makes clear, there is no such requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 25, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118217\"><a href=\"/opinion/118217/federal-election-commn-v-akins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Obviously, the ideal remedy would be if we could order that plaintiffs be allowed to vote. Barring a finding that the ICCPR is self-executing, that remedy is not available. Continued non-compliance, however, is a circumstance that cannot be ignored any longer.

Further, it is an unquestionable fact that the United States has not met its obligation under the ICCPR to take steps toward allowing these citizens to exercise this fundamental right. <i>See</i> ICCPR art. 2, para. 2. It must be assumed that the United States will give effect to a judicial declaration stating its failure to meet its obligations in this respect, and, at a minimum, we must ensure that any future inaction by the government is not based on an inaccurate understanding of its obligations under international law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. \"Embarrassment\" v.

However, I cannot accept, and am highly disturbed by, the proposition espoused by the majority that the outcome of this appeal should in any way be dictated by its perception that a declaration by this court that the United States has failed to comply with its treaty obligations might \"embarrass\" the United States and \"could be trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 150-51. These statements are worrisome because they demonstrate a misperception of the role of federal courts vis-&#224;-vis treaties and other international law. The interpretation of treaties and international law, as an integral part of the law of the land, is a non-delegable judicial duty and function that cannot be avoided by this court. Indeed, federal courts are the final interpreters of treaties. <i>Juda,</i> 13 Cl.Ct. at 678. The United States is just another party in this case, as it is in the thousands that are heard before the federal courts throughout the nation. It has no higher standing than any other party, and is entitled to no higher privilege than private citizens. It is precisely because the courts of the United States are perceived by the world at large as upholding these high standards of impartiality that a declaration exposing the government's failure to comply with its treaty obligations, rather than \"embarrassing\" the U.S., as the majority suggests, would have a highly salutary effect by showing the world that we practice what we preach: the rule of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Embarrassment indeed! The U.S. <i>should</i> be embarrassed at its denying equal rights to four million of its citizens in this day and age. That fact itself &#8212; particularly in light of the government's intense encouragement of democratic reform in other nations and purported commitment to international instruments that guarantee equal political participation by all citizens &#8212; could be \"trumpeted as propaganda in international bodies and elsewhere.\" <i>Maj. op.</i> at 150-51. Was it \"embarrassment\" that finally reversed <i>Plessy</i>? If embarrassment is what it takes to give equal rights to the United States citizens of Puerto Rico, maybe a dose is appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There comes a point when the courts must intervene to correct a great wrong, particularly one of their own creation, because the political branches of government cannot or will not act. <i>See, e.g., Brown v.

Of course, these statements are simply inaccurate and do not reflect the facts. There is no room for doubt that Public Law 600, 64 Stat. 319 (1950) (codified at 48 U.S.C &#167; 731b, et seq.) (authorizing Puerto Rico to enact a constitution for local self-government), and its sequel, Public Law 447, 66 Stat. 327 (1952) (resolution approving Puerto Rico's Constitution), did nothing to change the underlying constitutional status of Puerto Rico as an unincorporated territory, subordinated to Congress' plenary powers under the Territorial Clause, U.S. Const., Art. IV, &#167; 3, c. 2. <i>See generally</i> David M. Helfeld, <i>The Historical Prelude to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> 21 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 135 (1952); David M.

He did not need to be influenced by academics on questions of expansionism or how to deal with the colonies. In 1900, he became the first civilian governor of the Philippine Islands at a time when the Aguinaldo Insurrection &#8212; a war that led to thousands of U.S. casualties and over 100,000 civilian deaths, many more than in the entire Spanish-American War &#8212; was in full swing<i>See generally</i> Brian McAllister Linn, <i>The Philippine War, 1899-1902</i> (2000). In 1904, while Secretary of War under President Theodore Roosevelt, Taft oversaw not only the Philippines, but also Cuba and Puerto Rico. In 1906, he was sent to Cuba as its provisional governor under the Platt Amendment to the Cuban Constitution, which allowed the United States to intervene in Cuban affairs during times of \"unrest.\" However, it was during his time as President that Taft became openly disenchanted with Puerto Rico and its inhabitants as a result of the so-called Budget Crisis of 1909. <i>See</i> Truman R. Clark, <i>President Taft and the Puerto Rican Appropriations Crisis of 1909,</i> 26 The Americas 152-70 (1969). President Taft accused Puerto Rico's elected leaders of irresponsibility and political immaturity, and suggested that too much power had been given to Puerto Ricans \"for their own good.\" Message from President Taft to Congress, S.Rep.

Because the interest represented by the plaintiffs' claim is of paramount importance to our democratic structure, we ought to approach their claim searchingly rather than skeptically,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a> with the understanding that the court's declaratory authority should be exercised to its outermost limits if the claim is otherwise viable.

The Supremacy Clause and Article III require a court to examine independently the intentions of the treatymakers to decide if a treaty, by its own force, creates individually enforceable rights. While the Senate's preratification view on the matter is entitled to some weight, other facts, including extrinsic evidence concerning the Treaty's negotiation history and international practice under the Treaty, are relevant. Because the procedural posture of this case has precluded introduction of evidence regarding the ICCPR's negotiation and enforcement history, it is premature to dismiss on the ground that the Treaty does not provide the plaintiffs with enforceable rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senate's practice of declaring certain treaties to be non-self-executing is of relatively recent origin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a> <i>See</i> L.

L.Rev. 1082, 1111 (1992) (describing the rule under British law that a treaty does not have domestic effect until Parliament passes implementing legislation). This is a direct result of the Supremacy Clause, which makes treaties part of the \"supreme law of the land\" along with federal statutes, federal common law, and the Constitution itself. U.S. Const. art. VI., cl. 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a> The Constitution's grant of power to the federal judiciary also recognizes that treaties constitute domestic law. Under article III, &#167; 2, cl. 1, the federal judicial power \"extend[s] to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under . . . Treaties.\" The express language of the Constitution thus provides that a treaty ratified by the President, after the Senate's advice and consent, <i>see</i> U.S. Const. art.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the States were reluctant to enforce treaties entered into by the national government. In proposing the Virginia Plan as the working draft for the new Constitution, Edmund Randolph complained about the Articles' powerlessness to \"cause infractions of treaties . . . to be punished.\" 1 M. Farrand, <i>The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787</i> 19 (rev. ed.1996). James Madison shared this view. He claimed that \"experience [under the Articles] had evidenced a constant tendency in the States to . . . violate national Treaties. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> at 164. The Constitution sought to remedy this tendency by making treaties \"the supreme law of the land.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p182\">\n      <span class=\"num\">182</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Framers' intention to establish treaties as law, without further legislative action, is demonstrated by several of the proposals that the Constitutional Convention rejected. One such proposal would have required that treaties be sanctioned by legislation if they were to have \"the operation of laws.\" J. Madison, <i>Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787</i> 520 (1966 ed.). Another would have established two types of treaties: one requiring only action by the President and the Senate, and a second requiring additional action by the House of Representatives. <i>See</i> 2 Farrand, <i>supra</i> at 394. The rejection of these proposals illustrates the Framers' intention that all treaties constitute law under the Supremacy Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a> As James Wilson stated: \"[The Supremacy Clause] will show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure [their] performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry [them] into effect.\" 2 J.

For example, in Federalist No. 22, Alexander Hamilton explained that \"the treaties of the United States, to have any force at all, must be considered as part of the law of the land. Their true import, as far as respects individuals, must, like all other laws, be ascertained by judicial determinations.\" <i>The Federalist No.22</i> at 150 (C. Rossiter ed.1961). Similarly, at the North Carolina ratifying convention, one of the Constitution's supporters explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p184\">\n      <span class=\"num\">184</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was necessary that treaties should operate as laws on individuals.

Even those opposing ratification shared in this view. \"Brutus,\" in criticizing Article III, stated that he could \"readily comprehend what is meant by deciding a case under a treaty. For as treaties will be the law of the land, every person who has rights or privileges secured by a treaty, will have the aid of courts in recovering them.\" 16 J. Kaminski and G.

[W]hen the constitution was ratified, the case as to the treaty in question stood upon the same footing, as if every act constituting an impediment to a creditor's recovery had been expressly repealed, and any further act passed, which the public obligation had before required, if a repeal alone would not have been sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p192\">\n      <span class=\"num\">192</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p193\">\n      <span class=\"num\">193</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case went to the Supreme Court, where each Justice wrote his own opinion.

There is no doubt that the Senate may hinge its consent to ratify a treaty on a reservation. <i>See Haver v.

But a reservation is a \"unilateral statement. . . whereby [one party] purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in the application to that State.\" <i>Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,</i> art. 2(1)(d) (1969). A reservation thus has an actual effect on the terms of the treaty. <i>See</i> M. Glennon, <i>The Constitutional Power of the United States Senate to Condition Its Consent to Treaties,</i> 67 Chi.-Kent. L.Rev. 533, 542 n. 63 (1991) (citing authority). And the reservation will vitiate the Senate's consent if its terms are not incorporated into the treaty. <i>See</i> Henkin, <i>Foreign Affairs, supra,</i> at 180-81.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A non-self-execution declaration differs materially from a reservation. <i>See Restatement, supra</i> at &#167; 314, cmt. d. The declaration is not presented to the other international signatories as a request for a modification of the treaty's terms. Rather, it is directed primarily toward United States courts to express \"the sense of the Senate\" that the treaty should not be interpreted to establish individually enforceable rights. As two leading commentators have explained, the Senate does not have the power to bind a court to such declarations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Senate lacks the constitutional authority to declare the non-self-executing character of a treaty with binding effect on U.S. courts. The Senate has the unicameral power only to consent to ratification of treaties, not to pass domestic legislation. A declaration is not part of a treaty in the sense of modifying the legal obligations created by it. A declaration is merely an expression of an interpretation or of a policy or position. U.S. courts are bound by the Constitution to apply treaties as the law of the land. They are not bound to apply expressions of opinion adopted by the Senate (and concurred in by the President). The courts must undertake their own examination of the terms and context of each provision in a treaty to which the United States is a party and decide whether it is self-executing. The treaty is law. The Senate's declaration is not law. The Senate does not have the power to make law outside the treaty instrument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S.

A declaration that only has domestic effect is, in reality, an attempt to legislate concerning the internal implementation of a treaty. But the power to legislate is not granted to the Senate under Article II. Legislation may only be enacted through bicameral adoption and presentation to the President as set forth in Article I. <i>See INS v.

In its resolution consenting to the treaty, the Senate included a reservation whereby the United States reserved the right to redevelop its portion of the power generated on the river only through an act of Congress. <i>See id.</i> The United States and Canada agreed that the reservation only concerned American domestic law and did not require any changes to the treaty. <i>See id.</i> at 540-41.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Power Authority of the State of New York sought a license from the Federal Power Commission to use the Niagara River for the state's anticipated power project. <i>See id.</i> at 539.

That case involved whether the right to be free from arbitrary abduction and detention was protected under customary international law. The plaintiff in Sosa did not sue directly under the ICCPR but rather argued that the Treaty's terms helped establish the relevant principle of customary international law for purposes of his Alien Tort Act claim. The Court relied on the Senate's non-self-execution declaration in the ICCPR as one factor to support its conclusion that the ICCPR could not, by itself, establish a rule of customary international law. <i>See id.</i> at 2763 &amp; 2767. But the Court was not faced with (and did not decide) whether the Senate's declaration <i>ipso facto</i> prevents a plaintiff from suing directly under the Treaty. Because the question in Sosa was not the binding effect of the Senate's non-self-execution declaration in determining whether the ICCPR establishes a private cause of action, the parties did not present the Court with (and it did not address) the separation of powers arguments questioning the Senate's authority to issue such declarations. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Reply Brief of United States at 8, <i>Sosa, supra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn64\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64_ref\">64</a>\n        <p> I am less sanguine about whether plaintiffs may successfully press a claim under customary international law.
