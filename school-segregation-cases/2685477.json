Lewis contends that the trial court\n\nerred and violated his right to due process in not permitting him to present the defense of\n\nnecessity. Lewis, who was found guilty of possessing marijuana, argues that he was\n\nentitled to present a necessity defense, since he proffered evidence that \"his nearly two-\n\nyear effort to obtain adequate pain medication from the prison had proven futile, leaving\n\nhim no reasonable alternative to possessing unauthorized medication.\"\n\n       We conclude that Lewis's proffer regarding the defense of necessity was\n\ninsufficient to demonstrate that he was entitled to present such a defense. We therefore\n\nconclude that the trial court did not violate Lewis's right to due process in not permitting\n\nLewis to present a necessity defense, and we affirm the judgment.\n\n                                             II.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       On October 22, 2012, Lewis, an inmate at Richard J. Donovan Correctional\n\nFacility, was found smoking marijuana in his cell. The correctional officer who smelled\n\nmarijuana approached Lewis's cell, saw him holding two marijuana cigarettes, and, after\n\nsearching Lewis's person, found 13 bindles, totaling 12.17 grams, of marijuana.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f       The San Diego County District Attorney filed an information alleging that Lewis\n\npossessed a controlled substance while in prison (Pen. Code, § 4573.6).1 The\n\ninformation also alleged that Lewis had been previously convicted of four serious or\n\nviolent felonies, within the meaning of sections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i),\n\n1170.12, and 668.\n\n       A jury convicted Lewis of possessing a controlled substance while in prison.\n\nLewis admitted to having suffered a prior strike conviction. The trial court sentenced\n\nLewis to two years in prison. Lewis filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\n                                            III.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n       Lewis contends that the trial court violated his due process rights \"by barring his\n\nnecessity defense where [he] presented substantial evidence that his nearly two-year\n\neffort to obtain adequate pain medication from the prison had proven futile, leaving him\n\nno reasonable alternative to possessing unauthorized medication.\"\n\nA.     Additional background\n\n       Prior to trial, Lewis filed a motion seeking to be permitted to present the common\n\nlaw defense of necessity. Lewis argued that he suffered from chronic pain, and that\n\nbecause prison personnel had failed to adequately address his medical needs, it had\n\nbecome necessary for him to use marijuana to treat his severe and constant pain.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n                                              3\n\f       Lewis recounted that he had filed administrative medical complaints and appeals\n\nconcerning his medical care on more than 10 occasions. Lewis first filed an\n\nadministrative request in November 2010, while he was incarcerated at Folsom State\n\nPrison. In that request, Lewis noted that he had been waiting for 60 days to see a doctor\n\nand was in pain. On December 8, 2010, Lewis saw a doctor who prescribed a two-week\n\nregimen of Tylenol for Lewis's pain and noted that Lewis should \"have a follow up\n\nthereafter.\" That doctor also advised Lewis to do some neck and back exercises.\n\n       Lewis submitted four additional requests for medical treatment for back pain in\n\nJanuary, March, and June 2011. In March, Lewis was given morphine. In June, Lewis\n\nrequested morphine. On or around June 21, he was told that he would be seeing a doctor\n\nin a week. When Lewis had not seen a doctor by July 1, he filed an administrative\n\nappeal, requesting that his \"back and neck pain be addressed and that [he] be allowed to\n\nspeak to a doctor.\"\n\n       Lewis filed an additional medical treatment request on August 5, 2011. Lewis\n\nconsulted with a nurse who issued a \"referral to MD.\" At that time, Lewis had reported\n\n\"acute/chronic pain\" at nine on a scale of one through 10. Lewis was being given\n\nnaproxen at that time. The notes also state that Lewis \"will refile if [his back] worsens in\n\n[the] meantime.\"\n\n       The next medical treatment request that Lewis filed was on November 14, 2011.\n\nHe was seen by a nurse within two days of this request.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       On February 14, 2012, Lewis filed a \"Patient/Inmate Health Care Appeal.\" On the\n\nform, Lewis stated that he had been \"in extreme back pain\" for the past two months, and\n\nthat his \"medication does not work and has expired.\" He complained that he had waited\n\nsix weeks to see a doctor, and that his last three medical appointments had been\n\ncancelled.\n\n       Lewis filed a \"third 602 [appeal]\" seeking to see a doctor on May 17, 2012. He\n\nsaid that he had been prescribed ibuprofen, and that it had not alleviated his back and\n\nneck pain. On May 29, 2012, Lewis sent a letter to the Healthcare Appeals Coordinator\n\nregarding a \"[d]enial of right to file appeal.\" Lewis complained that his \"medications\n\nhave expired\" and sought further treatment. Lewis was seen on May 31, 2012 by Dr.\n\nPaul Gallagher. Dr. Gallagher noted that \"unfortunately, recommendations by Dr. Griffin\n\n[on March 5, 2012] have never been followed through on.\" Those recommendations had\n\nincluded that Lewis undergo an MRI of his cervical spine. Dr. Gallagher requested an\n\n\"Orthopedics evaluation of carpal tunnel and ulnar neuropathy and an MRI of the\n\npatient's neck.\" With respect to Lewis's medications, Dr. Gallagher noted that \"Med\n\nreconciliation reviewed with patient\" and made no changes to Lewis's medications. Dr.\n\nGallagher's notes do not indicate that Lewis was seeking or required a change in\n\nmedications.\n\n       Apparently, as of July 12, 2012, Lewis had not undergone an MRI. He filed a\n\n\"Patient/Inmate Appeal\" form on that date indicating that he had been informed that the\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fMRI request had been denied. The form indicates that this appeal was \"Cancelled\" on\n\nAugust 7, 2012.\n\n       On September 14, 2012, Lewis was transferred to the Richard J. Donovan\n\nCorrectional Facility. Lewis was \"designated to be housed in a Lower Bunk/Lower Tier\n\ncell.\" However, because there were \"no cells available\" to accommodate his needs, he\n\nwas placed in the Administrative Segregation Unit. In papers filed in the trial court,\n\nLewis asserted that while in the Administrative Segregation Unit, he was denied \"his\n\nmedical appliances which included a back and wrist brace.\"\n\n       Lewis filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on October 16, 2012, regarding\n\nhis placement in the Administrative Segregation Unit. The petition was denied by the\n\ntrial court due to Lewis's failure to include a copy of his administrative appeal in support\n\nof the petition.\n\n       Sometime between October 16 and October 22 (the date Lewis was found in\n\npossession of marijuana), he was placed in the general population.\n\n       In support of his motion to be permitted to present the defense of necessity,\n\nLewis's attorney proffered the testimony of a pain management expert, Dr. David\n\nBearman, who was prepared to testify regarding the efficacy of marijuana for medical\n\npurposes, and to the fact that \"he would have prescribed marijuana to treat Mr. Lewis'\n\ncondition.\"\n\n       After hearing argument from both parties concerning Lewis's offer of proof\n\nregarding the defense of necessity, the trial court ruled that Lewis would not be permitted\n\n                                              6\n\fto present that defense. The trial court determined that Lewis's offer of proof on the\n\ncommon law medical necessity defense was insufficient to permit the evidence pertinent\n\nto it to go to the jury. The trial court concluded, \"I think the legal alternatives were not\n\nexhausted, because it appear[s] that the appeals were responded to in most respects.\" The\n\ntrial court also concluded, \"I don't think that it even rises to the level to bring to a jury,\n\nbecause the emergency basis is not reached.\"\n\nB.     Analysis\n\n       California generally recognizes a common law necessity defense when a defendant\n\nis charged with committing any criminal act except the taking of an innocent person's\n\nlife. (People v. Slack (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 937, 940 (Slack).) An individual claiming\n\nthe common law defense of necessity must establish six required elements: \"1. The act\n\ncharged as criminal must have been done to prevent a significant evil; [¶] 2. There must\n\nhave been no adequate [legal] alternative to the commission of the act; [¶] 3. The harm\n\ncaused by the act must not be disproportionate to the harm avoided; [¶] 4. The accused\n\nmust entertain a good-faith belief that his act was necessary to prevent the greater harm;\n\n[¶] 5. Such belief must be objectively reasonable under all the circumstances; and [¶] 6.\n\nThe accused must not have substantially contributed to the creation of the emergency.\"\n\n(People v. Pena (1983) 149 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14, 25-26, fns. omitted; see also\n\nCALCRIM No. 3403.)\n\n       \"The standard for evaluating the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation is\n\nwhether a reasonable jury, accepting all the evidence as true, could find the defendant's\n\n                                                7\n\factions justified by necessity.\" (People v. Trippet (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1539\n\n(Trippet), citing Slack, supra, 210 Cal.App.3d at p. 941.) \"The court in Slack noted that\n\nsatisfying the required foundational burden through an offer of proof rather than on the\n\nwitness stand makes no difference to the standard of review on appeal, which is 'whether\n\nthere is evidence deserving of consideration from which reasonable jurors could conclude\n\nthe Pena elements have been satisfied.' \" (Trippet, supra, at p. 1539.)\n\n       We need not analyze all six elements of the common law necessity defense in this\n\ncase because we conclude, as a matter of law, that Lewis failed to demonstrate that he\n\ncould establish that he had no adequate legal alternative to possessing marijuana.2\n\n       \"Under any definition of the[] defenses [of duress and necessity] one principle\n\nremains constant: if there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law, 'a\n\nchance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm,' the\n\ndefenses will fail.\" (United States v. Bailey (1980) 444 U.S. 394, 410 (Bailey).) Thus, if\n\na defendant had legal alternatives to prevent or avoid the alleged \"significant harm,\" he or\n\nshe is not entitled to a necessity defense.\n\n       Lewis offered evidence that he had complained about his pain to prison personnel\n\non a number of occasions, that he had received morphine, and that he was not satisfied\n\n2      Because we conclude that Lewis failed to proffer sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate his ability to establish a necessity defense, we need not address the People's\ncontention that a necessity defense is unavailable to Lewis as a result of the\nCompassionate Use Act of 1996's limitations regarding the necessity defense (see Health\n& Saf. Code, § 11362.5; see also People v.Galambos (2002) 104 Cal.App.4th 1147, 1159\n[holding that the \"limited immunity afforded under\" the Compassionate Use Act of 1996\n\"is incompatible with a common law defense of medical necessity\"]).\n                                              8\n\fwith the pain relief provided by morphine or ibuprofen. He had not tried other\n\nmedications, however, and he did not present evidence that alternative, effective legal\n\npain medications did not exist, or that he had sought out and tried alternative pain\n\nmedications and those medications were ineffective. An individual \"cannot claim to have\n\nno reasonable alternative to smoking marijuana when a legal medication is available and\n\nknown to both [him or] her and [his or] her doctor.\" (Trippet, supra, 56 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1539, citing Bailey, supra, 444 U.S. at p. 410, and People v. Patrick (1981) 126\n\nCal.App.3d 952, 960.) Lewis did not present evidence that there existed no other legal\n\nmedications available to him that could have addressed his pain and that marijuana was\n\nhis only option for pain management. In fact, his complaints often refer to his requests\n\nfor more or different medications to alleviate his symptoms.\n\n       Lewis contends, however, that even if there might exist legal medications that\n\ncould have alleviated his pain, as a result of his incarceration he is in a unique position;\n\naccording to Lewis, he does not have the ability to \"go to a different doctor or try a\n\ndifferent prescription,\" which, he maintains, effectively meant that he had no legal\n\nmedical alternatives available to him. Lewis asserts that \"going through the prison health\n\ncare system was no longer a reasonable legal alternative\" and that \"the only other\n\navailable alternative would be for [him] to possess an unauthorized drug.\" Lewis\n\nacknowledges that \"alternative pain medications and treatments existed and that Lewis\n\ndid not 'try' them,\" but contends, \"what this argument misses is that for nearly two years,\n\nthe prisons inexplicably refused to make alternative medications available for Lewis to\n\n                                              9\n\ftry, despite his repeated requests for effective treatment.\" Thus, Lewis's medical\n\nnecessity argument is not simply that he needed marijuana to address his pain, but that\n\nbecause he was unable to obtain adequate pain relief through the prison health care\n\nsystem, he was therefore essentially \"forced\" to use marijuana to address his pain.\n\n       Although we acknowledge that Lewis's position as a confined prisoner\n\ncomplicates the issue of the availability and/or convenience of medical care that could\n\naddress his chronic pain, we disagree with Lewis's contention that his status as a prisoner\n\nleft him with no legally permissible alternatives for obtaining adequate pain management.\n\nAlthough the record discloses that Lewis made a number of initial requests for pain\n\ntreatment, Lewis has not pointed to any portion of the record demonstrating that he\n\npursued appeals of any of the medical decisions past a second level review. Further, he\n\ndid not file a petition for habeas corpus challenging his medical care, or a civil lawsuit\n\nseeking a different or more effective treatment. Lewis has made no showing that he\n\ncould not have obtained effective pain relief from his chronic pain through one of these\n\nlegal methods of addressing his concerns about the inadequacy of his medical treatments\n\nby medical staff. Therefore, as a matter of law, no reasonable jury could conclude that\n\nLewis's illegal possession of marijuana was the sole remedy available to him to address\n\nthe alleged failure of medical staff to assist him with his chronic pain.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f                                         IV.\n\n                                   DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 AARON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nHALLER, Acting P.

Lewis argued that he suffered from chronic pain, and that\n\nbecause prison personnel had failed to adequately address his medical needs, it had\n\nbecome necessary for him to use marijuana to treat his severe and constant pain.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n                                              3\n\f       Lewis recounted that he had filed administrative medical complaints and appeals\n\nconcerning his medical care on more than 10 occasions. Lewis first filed an\n\nadministrative request in November 2010, while he was incarcerated at Folsom State\n\nPrison. In that request, Lewis noted that he had been waiting for 60 days to see a doctor\n\nand was in pain. On December 8, 2010, Lewis saw a doctor who prescribed a two-week\n\nregimen of Tylenol for Lewis's pain and noted that Lewis should \"have a follow up\n\nthereafter.\" That doctor also advised Lewis to do some neck and back exercises.\n\n       Lewis submitted four additional requests for medical treatment for back pain in\n\nJanuary, March, and June 2011. In March, Lewis was given morphine. In June, Lewis\n\nrequested morphine. On or around June 21, he was told that he would be seeing a doctor\n\nin a week. When Lewis had not seen a doctor by July 1, he filed an administrative\n\nappeal, requesting that his \"back and neck pain be addressed and that [he] be allowed to\n\nspeak to a doctor.\"\n\n       Lewis filed an additional medical treatment request on August 5, 2011. Lewis\n\nconsulted with a nurse who issued a \"referral to MD.\" At that time, Lewis had reported\n\n\"acute/chronic pain\" at nine on a scale of one through 10. Lewis was being given\n\nnaproxen at that time. The notes also state that Lewis \"will refile if [his back] worsens in\n\n[the] meantime.\"\n\n       The next medical treatment request that Lewis filed was on November 14, 2011.\n\nHe was seen by a nurse within two days of this request.\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       On February 14, 2012, Lewis filed a \"Patient/Inmate Health Care Appeal.\" On the\n\nform, Lewis stated that he had been \"in extreme back pain\" for the past two months, and\n\nthat his \"medication does not work and has expired.\" He complained that he had waited\n\nsix weeks to see a doctor, and that his last three medical appointments had been\n\ncancelled.\n\n       Lewis filed a \"third 602 [appeal]\" seeking to see a doctor on May 17, 2012. He\n\nsaid that he had been prescribed ibuprofen, and that it had not alleviated his back and\n\nneck pain. On May 29, 2012, Lewis sent a letter to the Healthcare Appeals Coordinator\n\nregarding a \"[d]enial of right to file appeal.\" Lewis complained that his \"medications\n\nhave expired\" and sought further treatment. Lewis was seen on May 31, 2012 by Dr.\n\nPaul Gallagher. Dr. Gallagher noted that \"unfortunately, recommendations by Dr. Griffin\n\n[on March 5, 2012] have never been followed through on.\" Those recommendations had\n\nincluded that Lewis undergo an MRI of his cervical spine. Dr. Gallagher requested an\n\n\"Orthopedics evaluation of carpal tunnel and ulnar neuropathy and an MRI of the\n\npatient's neck.\" With respect to Lewis's medications, Dr. Gallagher noted that \"Med\n\nreconciliation reviewed with patient\" and made no changes to Lewis's medications. Dr.\n\nGallagher's notes do not indicate that Lewis was seeking or required a change in\n\nmedications.\n\n       Apparently, as of July 12, 2012, Lewis had not undergone an MRI. He filed a\n\n\"Patient/Inmate Appeal\" form on that date indicating that he had been informed that the\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fMRI request had been denied. The form indicates that this appeal was \"Cancelled\" on\n\nAugust 7, 2012.\n\n       On September 14, 2012, Lewis was transferred to the Richard J. Donovan\n\nCorrectional Facility. Lewis was \"designated to be housed in a Lower Bunk/Lower Tier\n\ncell.\" However, because there were \"no cells available\" to accommodate his needs, he\n\nwas placed in the Administrative Segregation Unit. In papers filed in the trial court,\n\nLewis asserted that while in the Administrative Segregation Unit, he was denied \"his\n\nmedical appliances which included a back and wrist brace.\"\n\n       Lewis filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on October 16, 2012, regarding\n\nhis placement in the Administrative Segregation Unit. The petition was denied by the\n\ntrial court due to Lewis's failure to include a copy of his administrative appeal in support\n\nof the petition.\n\n       Sometime between October 16 and October 22 (the date Lewis was found in\n\npossession of marijuana), he was placed in the general population.\n\n       In support of his motion to be permitted to present the defense of necessity,\n\nLewis's attorney proffered the testimony of a pain management expert, Dr. David\n\nBearman, who was prepared to testify regarding the efficacy of marijuana for medical\n\npurposes, and to the fact that \"he would have prescribed marijuana to treat Mr. Lewis'\n\ncondition.\"\n\n       After hearing argument from both parties concerning Lewis's offer of proof\n\nregarding the defense of necessity, the trial court ruled that Lewis would not be permitted\n\n                                              6\n\fto present that defense. The trial court determined that Lewis's offer of proof on the\n\ncommon law medical necessity defense was insufficient to permit the evidence pertinent\n\nto it to go to the jury. The trial court concluded, \"I think the legal alternatives were not\n\nexhausted, because it appear[s] that the appeals were responded to in most respects.\" The\n\ntrial court also concluded, \"I don't think that it even rises to the level to bring to a jury,\n\nbecause the emergency basis is not reached.\"\n\nB.     Analysis\n\n       California generally recognizes a common law necessity defense when a defendant\n\nis charged with committing any criminal act except the taking of an innocent person's\n\nlife. (People v. Slack (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2153374\"><a href=\"/opinion/2153374/people-v-slack/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 940 (Slack).) An individual claiming\n\nthe common law defense of necessity must establish six required elements: \"1. The act\n\ncharged as criminal must have been done to prevent a significant evil; [¶] 2. There must\n\nhave been no adequate [legal] alternative to the commission of the act; [¶] 3. The harm\n\ncaused by the act must not be disproportionate to the harm avoided; [¶] 4. The accused\n\nmust entertain a good-faith belief that his act was necessary to prevent the greater harm;\n\n[¶] 5. Such belief must be objectively reasonable under all the circumstances; and [¶] 6.\n\nThe accused must not have substantially contributed to the creation of the emergency.\"\n\n(People v. Pena (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Bailey (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110175\"><a href=\"/opinion/110175/united-states-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410 (Bailey).) Thus, if\n\na defendant had legal alternatives to prevent or avoid the alleged \"significant harm,\" he or\n\nshe is not entitled to a necessity defense.\n\n       Lewis offered evidence that he had complained about his pain to prison personnel\n\non a number of occasions, that he had received morphine, and that he was not satisfied\n\n2      Because we conclude that Lewis failed to proffer sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate his ability to establish a necessity defense, we need not address the People's\ncontention that a necessity defense is unavailable to Lewis as a result of the\nCompassionate Use Act of 1996's limitations regarding the necessity defense (see Health\n& Saf. Code, § 11362.5; see also People v.Galambos (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2259098\"><a href=\"/opinion/2259098/people-v-galambos/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

He had not tried other\n\nmedications, however, and he did not present evidence that alternative, effective legal\n\npain medications did not exist, or that he had sought out and tried alternative pain\n\nmedications and those medications were ineffective. An individual \"cannot claim to have\n\nno reasonable alternative to smoking marijuana when a legal medication is available and\n\nknown to both [him or] her and [his or] her doctor.\" (Trippet, supra, 56 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1539, citing Bailey, supra, 444 U.S. at p. 410, and People v. Patrick (1981) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2132992\"><a href=\"/opinion/2132992/people-v-patrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960.) Lewis did not present evidence that there existed no other legal\n\nmedications available to him that could have addressed his pain and that marijuana was\n\nhis only option for pain management. In fact, his complaints often refer to his requests\n\nfor more or different medications to alleviate his symptoms.\n\n       Lewis contends, however, that even if there might exist legal medications that\n\ncould have alleviated his pain, as a result of his incarceration he is in a unique position;\n\naccording to Lewis, he does not have the ability to \"go to a different doctor or try a\n\ndifferent prescription,\" which, he maintains, effectively meant that he had no legal\n\nmedical alternatives available to him. Lewis asserts that \"going through the prison health\n\ncare system was no longer a reasonable legal alternative\" and that \"the only other\n\navailable alternative would be for [him] to possess an unauthorized drug.\" Lewis\n\nacknowledges that \"alternative pain medications and treatments existed and that Lewis\n\ndid not 'try' them,\" but contends, \"what this argument misses is that for nearly two years,\n\nthe prisons inexplicably refused to make alternative medications available for Lewis to\n\n                                              9\n\ftry, despite his repeated requests for effective treatment.\" Thus, Lewis's medical\n\nnecessity argument is not simply that he needed marijuana to address his pain, but that\n\nbecause he was unable to obtain adequate pain relief through the prison health care\n\nsystem, he was therefore essentially \"forced\" to use marijuana to address his pain.\n\n       Although we acknowledge that Lewis's position as a confined prisoner\n\ncomplicates the issue of the availability and/or convenience of medical care that could\n\naddress his chronic pain, we disagree with Lewis's contention that his status as a prisoner\n\nleft him with no legally permissible alternatives for obtaining adequate pain management.\n\nAlthough the record discloses that Lewis made a number of initial requests for pain\n\ntreatment, Lewis has not pointed to any portion of the record demonstrating that he\n\npursued appeals of any of the medical decisions past a second level review. Further, he\n\ndid not file a petition for habeas corpus challenging his medical care, or a civil lawsuit\n\nseeking a different or more effective treatment. Lewis has made no showing that he\n\ncould not have obtained effective pain relief from his chronic pain through one of these\n\nlegal methods of addressing his concerns about the inadequacy of his medical treatments\n\nby medical staff. Therefore, as a matter of law, no reasonable jury could conclude that\n\nLewis's illegal possession of marijuana was the sole remedy available to him to address\n\nthe alleged failure of medical staff to assist him with his chronic pain.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f                                         IV.\n\n                                   DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 AARON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nHALLER, Acting P.
