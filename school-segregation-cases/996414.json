Martinez, Texas prisoner # 889868, appeals the\n\ndismissal of his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint as frivolous and\n\nfor failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1).\n\nHe argues that he has a constitutionally protected liberty\n\ninterest in not being classified as a gang member.     He also\n\nargues that the district court erred when it dismissed his\n\n\n\n\n     *\n       Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                             No. 03-40565\n                                  -2-\n\ncomplaint without holding a Spears** hearing or allowing him to\n\nconduct discovery.\n\n     Absent extraordinary circumstances, a prisoner does not\n\nhave a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his\n\nclassification or in remaining free from administrative\n\nsegregation.     See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 485 (1995);\n\nHarper v. Showers, 174 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir. 1999).       Thus,\n\nMartinez’s complaint failed to state a claim for relief under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.     See Doe v. Rains County Indep. Sch. Dist.,\n\n66 F.3d 1402, 1406 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n     A district court is not required to hold a Spears hearing\n\nin every case.    See Beck v. Lynaugh, 842 F.2d 759, 761 (5th Cir.\n\n1988).    Martinez has shown no error in the district court’s\n\ndecision to deny his motion for a Spears hearing.     Id.\n\nAdditionally, 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a) directs the district court to\n\nreview, “as soon as practicable after docketing,” a prisoner’s\n\ncomplaint against a governmental officer.     The statute contains\n\nno requirement for allowing the plaintiff to conduct discovery\n\nprior to dismissal.    28 U.S.C. § 1915A.   Martinez’s appeal is\n\nwithout arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous.       See Howard\n\nv. King, 707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir. 1983); 5TH CIR. R. 42.2.\n\nMartinez’s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     **\n          Spears v. McCotter, 766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\f                          No. 03-40565\n                               -3-\n\n     The district court’s dismissal of Martinez’s complaint and\n\nthe dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as “strikes”\n\nfor purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).    See Adepegba v. Hammons,\n\n103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir. 1996).    Martinez is cautioned that\n\nif he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to\n\nproceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed\n\nwhile he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is\n\nunder imminent danger of serious physical injury.    See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915(g).\n\n     APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTIONS WARNING ISSUED.\n\f",
