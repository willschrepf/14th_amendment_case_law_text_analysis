Alvarez, Justice\n\n           Whataburger of Alice (“WOA”) filed this suit against numerous parties (collectively\n\nreferred to as “Whataburger”) seeking declaratory relief to determine its rights and obligations\n\nunder a 1993 Settlement Agreement. The requested declaratory relief consisted of assertions\n\nwhich the parties describe as “site selection rights and issues”, “entity merger rights and issues”,\n\n“illegal payment issues”, “common law fiduciary duty issues” and “intellectual property issues”.\n\nIn its petition, WOA requested an award of attorney fees pursuant to the Texas Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act.\n\f        WOA filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the “site selection rights and\n\nissues”, only. Whataburger responded to this motion for partial summary judgment and filed its\n\nown cross motion for partial summary judgment on the same “site selection rights and issues”.\n\nWhataburger also filed a separate motion for partial summary judgment on all but one of the\n\nremainder of WOA’s declaratory-judgment claims, those pertaining to the “entity merger rights\n\nissues”, “common law fiduciary duty issues” and “intellectual property issues”. WOA responded\n\nto this motion for partial summary judgment, arguing fact issues precluded summary judgment.\n\nNeither party moved for summary judgment on WOA’s request for declaratory judgment on the\n\n“illegal payment issues”.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing on all of the motions for partial summary judgment and\n\nthereafter issued an order granting WOA’s motion for partial summary judgment on the “site\n\nselection rights and issues” and denying Whataburger’s cross motion on the same issues. The\n\ntrial court also denied Whataburger’s motion for summary judgment on the “entity merger rights\n\nand issues”, “common law fiduciary duty issues” and “intellectual property issues”.\n\n       WOA filed a motion to sever the “site selection rights and issues” from the remaining\n\nrequests for declaratory judgment. In this motion to sever, WOA requested “the attorneys’ fees\n\nassociated with the site selection rights and issues also be severed so that once severed, the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of attorneys’ fees associated with the site selection rights and issues\n\ncan be determined and a final judgment entered with respect to the site selection rights and issues\n\nand attorneys’ fees associated therewith.” In its prayer for relief, WOA requested “an order\n\nsevering this Court’s orders for Partial Summary Judgment, and the recovery of attorneys’ fees\n\nassociated therewith….”\n\n       Whataburger filed a response to WOA’s motion to sever and motion to abate the\n\nremaining claims.    In this response, Whataburger stated it did not oppose severance, and\n\nrequested “this Court enter an order abating the proceedings in the remaining claims pending\n\fresolution of the appeal of the November 9, 2015 Order in conjunction with granting WOA’s\n\nMotion to Sever.”\n\n          The trial court held a hearing on WOA’s motion to sever and Whataburger’s motion to\n\nabate. On January 26, 2016, the trial court issued an order in which it stated, “the Motion to\n\nSever should, in all things, be granted, and the Motion to Abate should, in all things, be granted.”\n\nIn the same order, the trial court ordered the site selection issues be severed and the remaining\n\nrequests for declaratory relief abated. On February 19, 2016, Whataburger filed a notice of\n\nappeal.\n\n          Except in instances not relevant here, we have jurisdiction only over final judgments.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE. ANN. § 51.012 (West 2015); North E. Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nAldridge, 400 S.W.2d 893, 895 (Tex. 1966). A final judgment disposes of all parties and issues.\n\nAldridge, 400 S.W.2d at 895.\n\n          There is no presumption in a summary judgment proceeding that the judgment was\n\nintended to dispose of all parties and issues. New York Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Sanchez, 799\n\nS.W.2d 677, 678 (Tex. 1990). To be a final, appealable summary judgment, the order granting\n\nthe motion must dispose of all parties and all issues before the court. Mafrige v. Ross, 866\n\nS.W.2d 590, 591 (Tex. 1993). If a trial court leaves the issue of attorneys’ fees to be determined\n\nin the future, any summary judgment is interlocutory. See Hood v. Amarillo Nat’l Bank, 815\n\nS.W.2d 545, 547 (Tex. 1991) (attorneys’ fees to be determined in future made summary\n\njudgment interlocutory); State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Leeds, 981 S.W.2d 693 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (trial court’s failure to address attorneys’ fees rendered\n\nsummary judgment interlocutory).\n\n          Here, although WOA did not request attorneys’ fees in its motion for partial summary\n\njudgment, it did make this request in its petition for declaratory relief and did specifically request\n\nsegregation and subsequent determination of attorneys’ fees associated with the site selection\n\nissues in its motion to sever. The trial court granted WOA’s motion to sever “in all things”;\n\fhowever, the order did not address the issue of attorneys’ fees, and Whataburger filed a notice of\n\nappeal before a hearing was held to make the determination. Moreover, neither the summary-\n\njudgment or severance order contained a Mother Hubbard clause, WOA never nonsuited its\n\nattorneys’ fees claims associated with the site selection issues, and the trial judge did not sever\n\nthe fees issue.\n\n        Therefore, it appears the trial court’s order granting WOA’s motion for partial summary\n\njudgment was not final and was not rendered final by the subsequent order severing the site\n\nselection issues. See New York Underwriters Ins. Co., 799 S.W.2d at 678; State Farm Mutual\n\nAuto. Ins. Co., 981 S.W.2d at 693; Franz v. Klein Indep. Sch. Dist., 01-97-01423-CV, 1999 WL\n\n430053, at *2 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Apr. 1, 1999, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n        Because it appears the summary-judgment order appealed is interlocutory and\n\nunappealable, it is therefore ORDERED that appellant show cause in writing on or before\n\nDecember 5, 2016 why this appeal should not be abated pending determination of the attorneys’\n\nfees issue or dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See Franz, 1999 WL 430053, at *2. Appellee\n\nshall have ten days from the date Appellants file their show cause brief to file a response.\n\n        Pending determination of this Court’s jurisdiction over this appeal, the Oral Argument\n\nscheduled for December 6, 2016 is cancelled.\n\n\n        It is so ORDERED on November 22, 2016.\n                                                             PER CURIAM\n\n\n\n\nATTESTED TO: _____________________________\n             Keith E.
