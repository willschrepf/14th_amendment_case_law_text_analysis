Gary  Showalter  and   Nenh\n                            \n\nPhetosomphone, plaintiffs in the district court,  appeal from\n\nthat  court's  award  of  attorneys'  fees  following   their\n\nsuccessful Title  VII suit.    Because we  conclude that  the\n\ndistrict court  did not abuse its  considerable discretion in\n\ndetermining an appropriate fee award, we affirm.\n\n                              I.\n\n     Plaintiffs  brought  separate suits,  later consolidated\n\nfor trial, against Allison Reed Group, Inc. (\"Allison Reed\"),\n\nNoel Smith and Carol  Marsella, alleging that plaintiffs were\n\nthe  victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.  In their\n\ncomplaints,  plaintiffs  sought  equitable   and  declaratory\n\nrelief and back pay under  Title VII of the Civil  Rights Act\n\nof 1964, 42  U.S.C.   2000e et seq., as  well as compensatory\n                                   \n\ndamages under  Rhode Island law  for the tort  of intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\n\n     Plaintiffs' tort  claim against Smith  and Marsella  was\n\ntried to a jury, and the Title VII claim against Allison Reed\n\nand Smith was tried  simultaneously to the court.1   The jury\n\nreturned  a verdict in  favor of defendants  on the state-law\n\nclaim.    The  court  ruled,  however,  that  plaintiffs  had\n\nestablished  a claim  of  sexual harassment  under Title  VII\n\n                    \n\n     1The district court directed  a verdict for Allison Reed\non the state-law count at the close of plaintiffs' case.  The\ncourt also ruled that Marsella was not a statutory \"employer\"\nunder Title VII and was therefore not a proper defendant with\nrespect to that count.\n\n                             -2-\n\nagainst Allison Reed and Smith.   The court ordered defendant\n\nAllison  Reed to establish  a procedure for  claims of sexual\n\nharassment,  and  enjoined  it  from  allowing  future sexual\n\nharassment  of  Showalter should  he  return to  work.2   The\n\ncourt  found  that  Phetosomphone  had   been  constructively\n\ndischarged  as a result of the sexual harassment and had been\n\nout  of work for eight weeks, and  it awarded him back pay of\n\n$1,737.60  plus  prejudgment  interest.     The  factual  and\n\nprocedural background of this case and the court's rulings on\n\nthe  merits are set forth  in detail in  Showalter v. Allison\n                                                             \n\nReed Group, Inc., 767 F. Supp. 1205 (D.R.I. 1991).  \n                \n\n     After  its decision  on the  merits, the  district court\n\ninvited  plaintiffs to  submit an  application for  costs and\n\nattorneys'  fees pursuant  to 42  U.S.C.    2000e-5(k).   The\n\ncourt stated that \"[t]he application for counsel fees must be\n\nsupported  by a detailed,  contemporaneous accounting  of the\n\ntime spent by the attorneys  on this case.\"  767 F.  Supp. at\n\n1215.  Plaintiffs'  counsel submitted an  application seeking\n\nattorneys' fees  and costs  totalling $83,177.   The district\n\ncourt  held  a  hearing  on  the  application,  and  directed\n\n                    \n\n     2At the time of  trial, Showalter was out of work due to\na  back  injury  and  was  receiving  worker's  compensation.\nBecause Showalter had not left his  employment because of the\nharassment but  rather on account  of the  injury, the  court\nheld  that Showalter was not entitled to back pay.  The court\nawarded Showalter $1 in nominal damages.\n\n                             -3-\n\nplaintiffs to submit  additional documentation in support  of\n\ntheir claim.\n\n     The district  court ultimately allowed  only $12,762  in\n\nfees and  $240 in costs.  The  court issued a 13-page opinion\n\nexplaining  in detail  its reasons  for sharply  limiting the\n\naward both as to  hours allowed and the hourly  rate claimed.\n\nThe court attached to its opinion a 16-page appendix in which\n\nit  itemized  each  expenditure  of counsel  time  for  which\n\ncompensation  was  sought,  and  identified  which  had  been\n\nallowed  and which had been reduced or stricken.  This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                             II.\n\n     Title VII  provides that \"[i]n any  action or proceeding\n\nunder this subchapter the court, in its discretion, may allow\n\nthe prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United\n\nStates,  a reasonable attorney's  fee (including expert fees)\n\nas  part  of  the  costs . . . .\"  42  U.S.C.     2000e-5(k).\n\nAccordingly, an award of  fees under the statute is  reviewed\n\nprimarily  under an  abuse  of discretion  standard, and  the\n\ntrial  court's range  of  discretion  is particularly  broad.\n\nUnited States v.  Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847  F.2d 12, 14\n                                           \n\n(1st Cir.  1988).  We have  advised parties on more  than one\n\noccasion  that \"the  battle [over  attorneys' fee  awards] is\n\nlikely to  be determined in the trial court.\"  E.g., Foley v.\n                                                          \n\nCity of Lowell,  948 F.2d 10, 19 (1st Cir.  1991).  Moreover,\n              \n\n                             -4-\n\n\"the  fee  applicant   bears  the   burden  of   establishing\n\nentitlement to an award and documenting the appropriate hours\n\nexpended and hourly  rates.\"  Hensley v.  Eckerhart, 461 U.S.\n                                                   \n\n424, 437 (1983).\n\n     In Hensley, the Supreme Court explained that \"[t]he most\n               \n\nuseful  starting  point  for  determining  the  amount  of  a\n\nreasonable fee is  the number of hours reasonably expended on\n\nthe litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly  rate,\"  461\n\nU.S.  at 433, adding that  adjustments could then  be made to\n\nreflect   \"other   considerations\"   including  the   results\n\nobtained.   Id. at  434.   In this  case, the  district court\n              \n\ndetermined compensable hours as follows:  it discounted hours\n\nsuch as trial time to exclude time needed only because of the\n\npresence of  the state  claim; it  disallowed hours  spent on\n\nspecific matters  that by their  nature could relate  only to\n\nthe state-law  claim; and  it disallowed hours  documented so\n\ngenerally that the court could not determine their connection\n\nto the Title VII  claim.3  Having  derived a total number  of\n\nallowable hours, the court then multiplied  them by an hourly\n\nfee, reducing plaintiffs' requested  hourly rate from $150 to\n\n$90 per hour.\n\n     Plaintiffs' broadest challenge on  this appeal is to the\n\nconcept of separating time devoted  to the federal and state-\n\n                    \n\n     3The  court also  disallowed  as  improbable claims  for\nhours in  excess of 12 hours  by an attorney on  any one day.\nThere is no separate challenge to this determination.\n\n                             -5-\n\nlaw claims.  Plaintiffs  appear to recognize that, considered\n\nseparately,  time spent  on  the state-law  claims would  not\n\nwarrant attorney's fees, those claims being outside the ambit\n\nof  Title VII  and unsuccessful to  boot.   Plaintiffs argue,\n\nhowever, that  because their  Title VII and  state-law claims\n\narose  out of  the  same  set  of  facts,  virtually  all  of\n\ncounsel's  efforts to prepare this  case for trial related to\n\nboth  the  state-law  and  the  federal  claims.    In  these\n\ncircumstances, plaintiffs  contend, the courts  have rejected\n\nattempts to attribute the  hours spent in the  preparation of\n\nthe case to  one claim or the other, and  instead have viewed\n\nthe  litigation as  a  whole in  setting  an appropriate  fee\n\naward.  \n\n     It  is quite  true  that in  Hensley  the Supreme  Court\n                                         \n\ncautioned that attempts to  allocate hours between claims may\n\nbe  unwarranted  where  an  action  involves   related  legal\n\ntheories applied to a common core of facts.  461 U.S. at 434-\n\n35.   Thus a  district court may  find that  the federal  and\n\nstate  claims  are so  interrelated,  and the  time  spent in\n\npreparation of  those claims so overlapping,  that an attempt\n\nto separate the time  attributable to one or the  other would\n\nbe futile.  See,  e.g., Munson v. Milwaukee Bd  School Dirs.,\n                                                           \n\n969  F.2d 266, 272 (7th  Cir. 1992); Wagenmann  v. Adams, 829\n                                                        \n\nF.2d 196, 225  (1st Cir. 1987).  But it  does not follow that\n\nthe  district  court  is  prevented  from  eliminating  hours\n                                   \n\n                             -6-\n\nattributable to  state-law claims  where, as here,  the court\n\nreasonably concludes that there is not a complete overlap and\n\nseparation is proper.   Indeed, in Hensley  itself, where the\n                                          \n\nsuccessful  and unsuccessful claims were closely related, the\n\nSupreme Court  said generally that \"[t]he  district court may\n\nattempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,\n\nor it may simply reduce the award to account for the  limited\n\nsuccess.\"  461 U.S. at 436-37.\n\n     In  this  instance there  were,  as  the district  court\n\nfound, discrete  tasks performed by  plaintiffs' counsel that\n\nrelated   only  to   the  state-law  claim   for  intentional\n\ninfliction  of   emotional  distress:     for  example,   the\n\ndevelopment   of  evidence   regarding  the   emotional  harm\n\nallegedly  suffered by  Showalter and  Phetosomphone (because\n\ncompensatory  damages  were not  then  available  under Title\n\nVII),  and  efforts  relating  to  the  jury,  such  as  jury\n\nselection and  preparation of instructions  (because only the\n\nstate-law  claim was  tried to  the  jury).      On the  same\n\nprinciple,  we  believe  that   the  court  was  entitled  to\n\neliminate or discount  hours or other expenses that  it found\n\nwould not have been incurred  but for the unsuccessful state-\n\nlaw claim.  See  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37;  Wagenmann, 829\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 225 (segregable expenses).\n\n     Plaintiffs   next   criticize   the   district   court's\n\napplication of this concept, arguing (often in fairly general\n\n                             -7-\n\nterms  but  with  some  examples)  that   some  of  the  time\n\ndiscounted  or disallowed  should have  been permitted.   For\n\nexample,   plaintiffs   say   that   time   spent   on  state\n\nadministrative proceedings, which are a predicate to filing a\n\nTitle  VII claim,  should  have been  allowed,  and that  too\n\nlittle  time  was  permitted  for  consulting  with  clients.\n\nAdmittedly,  in  excluding  or   limiting  these  hours,  the\n\ndistrict  court took a  very hard  line.   The disallowances,\n\nhowever, were not irrational:  they stemmed from the district\n\ncourt's decision that in these and similar instances, counsel\n\nprovided inadequate explanation of the nature of the services\n\nfor which compensation was  claimed, or of their relationship\n\nto  the Title  VII claims,  or both.    Thus, where  the time\n\nrecords contained  entries such as \"library\"  and \"letters to\n\nopposing counsel,\"  the court excluded the  time, noting that\n\nthe entries \"left the court guessing about their purposes.\"\n\n     There was some basis for the district court's insistence\n\nupon specificity.   The court, which  was intimately familiar\n\nwith the case, found  that plaintiffs' state-law claim played\n\na  very  substantial  role  in  plaintiffs'  preparation  and\n\nprosecution of this action.  The court expressly rejected the\n\nrepresentation of plaintiff's  counsel that efforts  relating\n\nexclusively to  the state-law claim comprised  less than five\n\npercent  of her  total work  on the  case, \"[s]ince  it [was]\n\nreadily apparent to  the Court that  most of the  plaintiffs'\n\n                             -8-\n\nefforts were  directed toward obtaining a  large damage award\n\nunder state  law . . .  .\"  Compensatory  damages, of course,\n\nwere not available under Title VII at the time of this trial.\n\nCompare Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166,   102,\n       \n\n105 Stat. 1071, 1072-73 (1991).  \n\n     The district court's skepticism was also grounded in its\n\nfinding  that counsel  had failed  to submit  contemporaneous\n\ntime records  showing hours worked.   This omission persisted\n\neven  after  the court  afforded  counsel  an opportunity  to\n\nremedy  the problem.4  We have expressly advised the bar that\n\n\"the absence of detailed contemporaneous time records, except\n\nin extraordinary circumstances, will  call for a  substantial\n\nreduction in any award or, in egregious cases, disallowance.\"\n\nGrendel's  Den, Inc. v. Larkin,  749 F.2d 945,  952 (1st Cir.\n                              \n\n1984);  accord,   Hensley,  461  U.S.  at   433  (\"Where  the\n                         \n\ndocumentation of hours is  inadequate, the district court may\n\nreduce the award accordingly.\").  In this case, the court did\n\nnot disallow  trial counsel's claim for lack of such records,\n\n                    \n\n     4Counsel  first  submitted  a   computer-generated  list\ncontaining the  dates that counsel had  worked on plaintiffs'\ncase,  a brief  description of  the tasks  performed and  the\nnumber  of hours expended.   The court  found this accounting\ninadequate  and requested  counsel to  submit contemporaneous\nrecords.    In response,  counsel  submitted  individual time\nsheets  for the entries on the chronological list.  The court\nfound that all of these time sheets were  written by the same\nhand in the  same pen, and  it concluded that the  sheets had\nnot been prepared contemporaneously.  This factual finding is\nnot clearly erroneous and we are bound to accept it.\n\n                             -9-\n\nbut  that  lack did  encourage  the court  to  resolve doubts\n\nagainst reimbursement.5  \n\n     We also reject the claim  that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in reducing counsel's hourly rate from $150 to\n\n$90.    We have  held  that  a district  court,  in fixing  a\n\nreasonable  fee  award,  is  not  bound  by  the hourly  rate\n\nrequested  by the  victor's  counsel; rather,  the court  may\n\nestablish  a  rate  that  it considers  reasonable  based  on\n\ncounsel's  skill and experience  and prevailing market rates.\n\nSee Metropolitan District Comm'n,  847 F.2d at 19; Wojtkowski\n                                                             \n\nv. Cade,  725 F.2d 127,  131 (1st  Cir. 1984).   The district\n       \n\ncourt noted that plaintiffs'  counsel had been practicing law\n\nfor only three years, and it stated that $75 to  $90 per hour\n\nwas the court's normal range for attorneys with this level of\n\nexperience.   The court awarded  counsel the high  end of the\n\nrange  to reflect  her  supervisory role  in the  litigation.\n\nPlaintiffs have provided us with no basis for overturning the\n\ncourt's judgment.  \n\n     Only one  aspect of  the district court's  determination\n\ngives us pause.  At the outset of its opinion, the court said\n\n                    \n\n     5The  lack of  contemporaneous records  did lead  to one\nspecific  disallowance,  but  not  of time  claimed  by  lead\ncounsel.    Plaintiffs  included  in   their  submission  the\naffidavit and  bill of  a predecessor attorney,  which listed\nonly  a  description  of services  and  a  total amount  due.\nNeither the  time expended in  total nor on  individual items\nwas included.  We  see no error whatever in  disallowing such\nan undocumented claim.\n\n                             -10-\n\nthat  the relief obtained by plaintiff on the Title VII claim\n\nwas \"relatively  limited in  comparison to the  scope of  the\n\nlitigation  as a  whole.\"   Specifically, the  court observed\n\nthat  each plaintiff's  complaint  had sought  $1 million  in\n\ncompensatory  damages on their  unsuccessful state-law claim,\n\nwhereas  plaintiffs ultimately  received only  $1 in  nominal\n\ndamages (in the  case of appellant  Showalter) and $1,737  in\n\nback pay (in  the case  of Phetosomphone).   Thus, the  court\n\nnoted,  \"[t]he combined monetary  relief that  the plaintiffs\n\nultimately received was less than one-tenth of one percent of\n\nwhat they originally sought.\"  \n\n     We think that plaintiffs'  proportionate success on  the\n\nTitle  VII claim  vis-a-vis their failure  to prevail  on the\n\nstate-law  claim is  irrelevant.   Since  the district  court\n\neliminated from the award any compensation for hours spent on\n\nthe prosecution of the state-law claim, it would be illogical\n\nto reduce further the award to reflect the lack of success of\n\nthat claim.  It is true that in a number of cases, the courts\n\nhave  stated that \"the extent  of a plaintiff's  success is a\n\ncrucial factor in  determining the proper amount of  an award\n\nof attorney's  fees . . .  .\"  Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 440; see\n                                                             \n\nalso Foley,  948 F.2d at 19.   But we think  these statements\n          \n\nmust  be understood  as referring  to the  degree of  overall\n\nsuccess  where  unsuccessful  claims  are  included  in   the\n                                                   \n\n                             -11-\n\ncalculation of the number of hours  for which compensation is\n\nallowed.    \n\n     Nevertheless,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  district\n\ncourt's comparison of the  outcomes achieved by plaintiffs in\n\ntheir  federal   and   state-law  claims   requires   further\n\nproceedings.   The district court  expressed this view  in an\n\nintroductory  section  of its  opinion;  the  belief did  not\n\nmanifest itself in any particular reduction in the fee award,\n\nand  the specific reductions in the award were based upon the\n\nlegitimate disallowance of hours.  If  the comment played any\n\nrole,  it  was   as  a  general  predicate  to   the  court's\n\npermissible decision to disallow  or discount hours not shown\n\nto be related to the successful claim.    \n\n                             III.\n\n     Finally,  plaintiffs  contend that  the  court  erred by\n\ndisallowing  its request for costs  other than $240 in filing\n\nfees. This argument need not detain us long.\n\n     The award of costs to the prevailing party, like the fee\n\naward,  is a  creature of  statute.   Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 54(d)\n\nstates that \"costs shall be allowed as a  matter of course to\n\nthe prevailing party unless the Court otherwise directs . . .\n\n.\"6   Allowable costs are listed  in 28 U.S.C    1920; and 28\n\n                    \n\n     6Although appellants' brief suggests  that costs may  be\nimposed  directly under section 2000e-5(k), \"[s]ection 2000e-\n5(k)  does not alter the  standard by which  the court awards\ncosts that are  not attorneys' fees pursuant to  Rule 54(d).\"\nMyrick v.  TNT Overland  Express, 143  F.R.D. 126, 128  (N.D.\n                                \n\n                             -12-\n\nU.S.C.   1924 provides  that \"the party claiming any  item of\n\ncost or disbursement shall  attach thereto an affidavit, made\n\nby himself  or his duly  authorized attorney or  agent having\n\nknowledge of the  facts, that  such item is  correct and  has\n\nbeen necessarily incurred  in the case and  that the services\n\nfor  which   fees  have   been  charged  were   actually  and\n\nnecessarily performed.\"  A  \"bill of costs\" form (AO  133) is\n\nmade available  to  the prevailing  party  by the  court;  in\n\naddition to  providing a worksheet to itemize costs, the form\n\nalso provides a built-in declaration tracking the language of\n\nthe statute.\n\n     In this  case, plaintiffs  neglected to  file a  bill of\n\ncosts form or to supply any other verification that the costs\n\nclaimed were \"necessarily incurred in  the case\" and that the\n\nservices for which compensation was sought were \"actually and\n\nnecessarily  performed.\"  Rather,  the affidavit submitted by\n\nplaintiffs stated only that the  costs were expended \"in  the\n\npreparation  and  litigation of  this  case,\"  which, as  the\n\ndistrict  court  noted,  is  a  broader  and  more  inclusive\n\nstandard.   The  court therefore  disallowed all  costs other\n\nthan  $240, which  represented  the filing  fees  in the  two\n\ncases;  these were the only costs which, in the court's view,\n\n                    \n\nOhio  1992); accord, Goostree v.

Preparing\n\na technically  adequate application for costs was plaintiffs'\n\nresponsibility, not  the court's; and it was  not a difficult\n\nor  onerous responsibility,  given the  \"bill of  costs\" form\n\navailable from the clerk.  \n\n                            * * *\n\n     Congress has provided for attorneys' fee awards in Title\n\nVII  cases.  It is important that the public policy reflected\n\nin  the statute not be  undone by requirements  of proof that\n\nare  overly stringent or  by too grudging  a test  of what is\n\nreasonable.  At the same time, such fee awards are peculiarly\n\nwithin the expertise and discretion of the district judge.  \n\n     It is often difficult to  strike the proper note in\n     fee-setting matters, to balance the need adequately\n     to compensate  successful counsel against  the need\n     to  burden unsuccessful  defendants fairly,  but no\n     more.  The district  court--which, as in this case,\n     has frequently lived  with the  litigation and  the\n\n                             -14-\n\n     lawyers  for  long period  of  time,  and which  is\n     likely to be more  familiar with the  marketplace--\n     has the best coign of vantage.  \n\nMetropolitan  Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d  at 20.   Here the trial\n                          \n\njudge  provided  an unusually  detailed  explanation for  the\n\nreduction  in the fees and  costs sought by  plaintiffs.  The\n\ncourt's  conclusions are  untainted by  legal error  and fall\n\nwithin  the  realm  of   reasonableness.    Accordingly,  the\n\ndistrict court's judgment is affirmed.\n                                     \n\n                             -15-\n\n          ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting.  I quite\n                                       \n\nagree with  much  of  the  court's  opinion.    Certainly  an\n\nattorney fees  determination should not be  a second lawsuit,\n\nand  a  court's finding  of  the number  of  hours reasonably\n\nspent, and of appropriate hourly rates in part based on first\n\nhand appraisal of counsel's ability, should not be reviewable\n\nexcept  for  special reason.    Nor  can  I  sympathize  with\n\nplaintiffs'  unexplained and  persistent disregard  of formal\n\nmethodology  rules.   I  am much  troubled,  however, by  the\n\ndistrict court's approach to a primary issue in the case, the\n\ntime  devoted to  the state  claim that  would not  have been\n\nspent  had that  issue not  been included.   The  federal and\n\nstate cases were not separate, but were totally related, even\n\nwith, as  defendant concedes, identical witnesses.   The only\n\ndifference  was that federal recovery, at  that time, did not\n\ninclude compensatory damages.   Even here there was a special\n\nconnection in that plaintiffs were obliged to  show, even for\n\nthe  federal count,  that their own,  conceded participation,\n\nwas unenjoyable and involuntary.  In this circumstance, total\n\ndisregard of hours charged for such items as conferences with\n\nclients;   contacts   with   counsel  for   defendants,   and\n\npreparation for,  and taking  of the deposition  of defendant\n\nSmith,  the principal  harasser, on  the ground  that counsel\n\n                             -15-\n\ncannot   allocate  and  subtract,  imposes  an  extraordinary\n\nburden.\n\n          As my  brothers say,  this might be  an appropriate\n\noccasion to adopt the suggestion in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n                                                        \n\nU.S. 424, 436-37 (1983), where  the Court said, \"The district\n\ncourt  may attempt to identify specific  hours that should be\n\neliminated,  or it may simply reduce the award to account for\n\nthe  limited success.\"  That,  however, brings me  to my real\n\ndifficulty, the district court's finding that this was a case\n\nwhere the relief obtained was \"truly limited in comparison to\n\nthe  scope of the litigation as a whole,\" citing Hensley, 461\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at 440.   In terms, counsel \"won on  one minor claim for\n\neach plaintiff.\"\n\n          In  Riverside  v.  Rivera, 477  U.S.  561,  574-576\n                                   \n\n(1986), the Court said,\n\n          Unlike  most  private  tort litigants,  a\n          civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate\n          important civil and constitutional rights\n          that  cannot be valued solely in monetary\n          terms. . . .\n\n               Because   damages   awards  do   not\n          reflect fully the public benefit advanced\n          by civil rights litigation,  Congress did\n          not  intend  for  fees  in  civil  rights\n          cases, unlike most  private law cases, to\n          depend on  obtaining substantial monetary\n          relief. . . .\n\n               Thus,   Congress   recognized   that\n          reasonable  attorney's fees  under   1988\n          are not conditioned upon and need not  be\n          proportionate  to  an   award  of   money\n          damages.\n\n                             -16-\n\nPlaintiffs had achieved the  maximum possible recovery on the\n\nfederal claims, including an order against defendant employer\n\nto  improve its  internal procedures  with respect  to sexual\n\nharassment.  By its  dwelling at length on the  state dollars\n\nsought   and,  though   not  applying   them  mathematically,\n\nconcluding the federal claim \"minor\" I cannot but  think that\n\nthe district court greatly  depreciated the Civil Rights Act,\n\nseriously   impairing   its  discretion.     I   would  favor\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                             -17-\n",

(\"Allison Reed\"),\n\nNoel Smith and Carol  Marsella, alleging that plaintiffs were\n\nthe  victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.  In their\n\ncomplaints,  plaintiffs  sought  equitable   and  declaratory\n\nrelief and back pay under  Title VII of the Civil  Rights Act\n\nof 1964, 42  U.S.C.   2000e et seq., as  well as compensatory\n                                   \n\ndamages under  Rhode Island law  for the tort  of intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress.\n\n     Plaintiffs' tort  claim against Smith  and Marsella  was\n\ntried to a jury, and the Title VII claim against Allison Reed\n\nand Smith was tried  simultaneously to the court.1   The jury\n\nreturned  a verdict in  favor of defendants  on the state-law\n\nclaim.    The  court  ruled,  however,  that  plaintiffs  had\n\nestablished  a claim  of  sexual harassment  under Title  VII\n\n                    \n\n     1The district court directed  a verdict for Allison Reed\non the state-law count at the close of plaintiffs' case.  The\ncourt also ruled that Marsella was not a statutory \"employer\"\nunder Title VII and was therefore not a proper defendant with\nrespect to that count.\n\n                             -2-\n\nagainst Allison Reed and Smith.   The court ordered defendant\n\nAllison  Reed to establish  a procedure for  claims of sexual\n\nharassment,  and  enjoined  it  from  allowing  future sexual\n\nharassment  of  Showalter should  he  return to  work.2   The\n\ncourt  found  that  Phetosomphone  had   been  constructively\n\ndischarged  as a result of the sexual harassment and had been\n\nout  of work for eight weeks, and  it awarded him back pay of\n\n$1,737.60  plus  prejudgment  interest.

Id. at  434.   In this  case, the  district court\n              \n\ndetermined compensable hours as follows:  it discounted hours\n\nsuch as trial time to exclude time needed only because of the\n\npresence of  the state  claim; it  disallowed hours  spent on\n\nspecific matters  that by their  nature could relate  only to\n\nthe state-law  claim; and  it disallowed hours  documented so\n\ngenerally that the court could not determine their connection\n\nto the Title VII  claim.3  Having  derived a total number  of\n\nallowable hours, the court then multiplied  them by an hourly\n\nfee, reducing plaintiffs' requested  hourly rate from $150 to\n\n$90 per hour.\n\n     Plaintiffs' broadest challenge on  this appeal is to the\n\nconcept of separating time devoted  to the federal and state-\n\n                    \n\n     3The  court also  disallowed  as  improbable claims  for\nhours in  excess of 12 hours  by an attorney on  any one day.\nThere is no separate challenge to this determination.\n\n                             -5-\n\nlaw claims.  Plaintiffs  appear to recognize that, considered\n\nseparately,  time spent  on  the state-law  claims would  not\n\nwarrant attorney's fees, those claims being outside the ambit\n\nof  Title VII  and unsuccessful to  boot.   Plaintiffs argue,\n\nhowever, that  because their  Title VII and  state-law claims\n\narose  out of  the  same  set  of  facts,  virtually  all  of\n\ncounsel's  efforts to prepare this  case for trial related to\n\nboth  the  state-law  and  the  federal  claims.    In  these\n\ncircumstances, plaintiffs  contend, the courts  have rejected\n\nattempts to attribute the  hours spent in the  preparation of\n\nthe case to  one claim or the other, and  instead have viewed\n\nthe  litigation as  a  whole in  setting  an appropriate  fee\n\naward.  \n\n     It  is quite  true  that in  Hensley  the Supreme  Court\n                                         \n\ncautioned that attempts to  allocate hours between claims may\n\nbe  unwarranted  where  an  action  involves   related  legal\n\ntheories applied to a common core of facts.  461 U.S. at 434-\n\n35.   Thus a  district court may  find that  the federal  and\n\nstate  claims  are so  interrelated,  and the  time  spent in\n\npreparation of  those claims so overlapping,  that an attempt\n\nto separate the time  attributable to one or the  other would\n\nbe futile.  See,  e.g., Munson v. Milwaukee Bd  School Dirs.,\n                                                           \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586883\"><a href=\"/opinion/586883/carl-munson-v-milwaukee-board-of-school-directors-raymond-e-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (7th  Cir. 1992); Wagenmann  v.

But it  does not follow that\n\nthe  district  court  is  prevented  from  eliminating  hours\n                                   \n\n                             -6-\n\nattributable to  state-law claims  where, as here,  the court\n\nreasonably concludes that there is not a complete overlap and\n\nseparation is proper.   Indeed, in Hensley  itself, where the\n                                          \n\nsuccessful  and unsuccessful claims were closely related, the\n\nSupreme Court  said generally that \"[t]he  district court may\n\nattempt to identify specific hours that should be eliminated,\n\nor it may simply reduce the award to account for the  limited\n\nsuccess.\"  461 U.S. at 436-37.\n\n     In  this  instance there  were,  as  the district  court\n\nfound, discrete  tasks performed by  plaintiffs' counsel that\n\nrelated   only  to   the  state-law  claim   for  intentional\n\ninfliction  of   emotional  distress:     for  example,   the\n\ndevelopment   of  evidence   regarding  the   emotional  harm\n\nallegedly  suffered by  Showalter and  Phetosomphone (because\n\ncompensatory  damages  were not  then  available  under Title\n\nVII),  and  efforts  relating  to  the  jury,  such  as  jury\n\nselection and  preparation of instructions  (because only the\n\nstate-law  claim was  tried to  the  jury).      On the  same\n\nprinciple,  we  believe  that   the  court  was  entitled  to\n\neliminate or discount  hours or other expenses that  it found\n\nwould not have been incurred  but for the unsuccessful state-\n\nlaw claim.  See  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 436-37;  Wagenmann, 829\n                                                        \n\nF.2d at 225 (segregable expenses).\n\n     Plaintiffs   next   criticize   the   district   court's\n\napplication of this concept, arguing (often in fairly general\n\n                             -7-\n\nterms  but  with  some  examples)  that   some  of  the  time\n\ndiscounted  or disallowed  should have  been permitted.   For\n\nexample,   plaintiffs   say   that   time   spent   on  state\n\nadministrative proceedings, which are a predicate to filing a\n\nTitle  VII claim,  should  have been  allowed,  and that  too\n\nlittle  time  was  permitted  for  consulting  with  clients.\n\nAdmittedly,  in  excluding  or   limiting  these  hours,  the\n\ndistrict  court took a  very hard  line.   The disallowances,\n\nhowever, were not irrational:  they stemmed from the district\n\ncourt's decision that in these and similar instances, counsel\n\nprovided inadequate explanation of the nature of the services\n\nfor which compensation was  claimed, or of their relationship\n\nto  the Title  VII claims,  or both.    Thus, where  the time\n\nrecords contained  entries such as \"library\"  and \"letters to\n\nopposing counsel,\"  the court excluded the  time, noting that\n\nthe entries \"left the court guessing about their purposes.\"\n\n     There was some basis for the district court's insistence\n\nupon specificity.   The court, which  was intimately familiar\n\nwith the case, found  that plaintiffs' state-law claim played\n\na  very  substantial  role  in  plaintiffs'  preparation  and\n\nprosecution of this action.  The court expressly rejected the\n\nrepresentation of plaintiff's  counsel that efforts  relating\n\nexclusively to  the state-law claim comprised  less than five\n\npercent  of her  total work  on the  case, \"[s]ince  it [was]\n\nreadily apparent to  the Court that  most of the  plaintiffs'\n\n                             -8-\n\nefforts were  directed toward obtaining a  large damage award\n\nunder state  law . . .  .\"  Compensatory  damages, of course,\n\nwere not available under Title VII at the time of this trial.\n\nCompare Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-166,   102,\n       \n\n105 Stat. 1071, 1072-73 (1991).  \n\n     The district court's skepticism was also grounded in its\n\nfinding  that counsel  had failed  to submit  contemporaneous\n\ntime records  showing hours worked.   This omission persisted\n\neven  after  the court  afforded  counsel  an opportunity  to\n\nremedy  the problem.4  We have expressly advised the bar that\n\n\"the absence of detailed contemporaneous time records, except\n\nin extraordinary circumstances, will  call for a  substantial\n\nreduction in any award or, in egregious cases, disallowance.\"\n\nGrendel's  Den, Inc. v.

In this case, the court did\n\nnot disallow  trial counsel's claim for lack of such records,\n\n                    \n\n     4Counsel  first  submitted  a   computer-generated  list\ncontaining the  dates that counsel had  worked on plaintiffs'\ncase,  a brief  description of  the tasks  performed and  the\nnumber  of hours expended.

In response,  counsel  submitted  individual time\nsheets  for the entries on the chronological list.  The court\nfound that all of these time sheets were  written by the same\nhand in the  same pen, and  it concluded that the  sheets had\nnot been prepared contemporaneously.

We have  held  that  a district  court,  in fixing  a\n\nreasonable  fee  award,  is  not  bound  by  the hourly  rate\n\nrequested  by the  victor's  counsel; rather,  the court  may\n\nestablish  a  rate  that  it considers  reasonable  based  on\n\ncounsel's  skill and experience  and prevailing market rates.\n\nSee Metropolitan District Comm'n,  847 F.2d at 19; Wojtkowski\n                                                             \n\nv.

The district\n       \n\ncourt noted that plaintiffs'  counsel had been practicing law\n\nfor only three years, and it stated that $75 to  $90 per hour\n\nwas the court's normal range for attorneys with this level of\n\nexperience.   The court awarded  counsel the high  end of the\n\nrange  to reflect  her  supervisory role  in the  litigation.\n\nPlaintiffs have provided us with no basis for overturning the\n\ncourt's judgment.  \n\n     Only one  aspect of  the district court's  determination\n\ngives us pause.  At the outset of its opinion, the court said\n\n                    \n\n     5The  lack of  contemporaneous records  did lead  to one\nspecific  disallowance,  but  not  of time  claimed  by  lead\ncounsel.    Plaintiffs  included  in   their  submission  the\naffidavit and  bill of  a predecessor attorney,  which listed\nonly  a  description  of services  and  a  total amount  due.\nNeither the  time expended in  total nor on  individual items\nwas included.  We  see no error whatever in  disallowing such\nan undocumented claim.\n\n                             -10-\n\nthat  the relief obtained by plaintiff on the Title VII claim\n\nwas \"relatively  limited in  comparison to the  scope of  the\n\nlitigation  as a  whole.\"   Specifically, the  court observed\n\nthat  each plaintiff's  complaint  had sought  $1 million  in\n\ncompensatory  damages on their  unsuccessful state-law claim,\n\nwhereas  plaintiffs ultimately  received only  $1 in  nominal\n\ndamages (in the  case of appellant  Showalter) and $1,737  in\n\nback pay (in  the case  of Phetosomphone).   Thus, the  court\n\nnoted,  \"[t]he combined monetary  relief that  the plaintiffs\n\nultimately received was less than one-tenth of one percent of\n\nwhat they originally sought.\"  \n\n     We think that plaintiffs'  proportionate success on  the\n\nTitle  VII claim  vis-a-vis their failure  to prevail  on the\n\nstate-law  claim is  irrelevant.   Since  the district  court\n\neliminated from the award any compensation for hours spent on\n\nthe prosecution of the state-law claim, it would be illogical\n\nto reduce further the award to reflect the lack of success of\n\nthat claim.  It is true that in a number of cases, the courts\n\nhave  stated that \"the extent  of a plaintiff's  success is a\n\ncrucial factor in  determining the proper amount of  an award\n\nof attorney's  fees . . .  .\"  Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 440; see\n                                                             \n\nalso Foley,  948 F.2d at 19.   But we think  these statements\n          \n\nmust  be understood  as referring  to the  degree of  overall\n\nsuccess  where  unsuccessful  claims  are  included  in   the\n                                                   \n\n                             -11-\n\ncalculation of the number of hours  for which compensation is\n\nallowed.    \n\n     Nevertheless,  we  do  not  believe  that  the  district\n\ncourt's comparison of the  outcomes achieved by plaintiffs in\n\ntheir  federal   and   state-law  claims   requires   further\n\nproceedings.   The district court  expressed this view  in an\n\nintroductory  section  of its  opinion;  the  belief did  not\n\nmanifest itself in any particular reduction in the fee award,\n\nand  the specific reductions in the award were based upon the\n\nlegitimate disallowance of hours.  If  the comment played any\n\nrole,  it  was   as  a  general  predicate  to   the  court's\n\npermissible decision to disallow  or discount hours not shown\n\nto be related to the successful claim.    \n\n                             III.\n\n     Finally,  plaintiffs  contend that  the  court  erred by\n\ndisallowing  its request for costs  other than $240 in filing\n\nfees. This argument need not detain us long.\n\n     The award of costs to the prevailing party, like the fee\n\naward,  is a  creature of  statute.   Fed. R.  Civ.  P. 54(d)\n\nstates that \"costs shall be allowed as a  matter of course to\n\nthe prevailing party unless the Court otherwise directs . . .\n\n.\"6   Allowable costs are listed  in 28 U.S.C    1920; and 28\n\n                    \n\n     6Although appellants' brief suggests  that costs may  be\nimposed  directly under section 2000e-5(k), \"[s]ection 2000e-\n5(k)  does not alter the  standard by which  the court awards\ncosts that are  not attorneys' fees pursuant to  Rule 54(d).\"\nMyrick v.

I quite\n                                       \n\nagree with  much  of  the  court's  opinion.    Certainly  an\n\nattorney fees  determination should not be  a second lawsuit,\n\nand  a  court's finding  of  the number  of  hours reasonably\n\nspent, and of appropriate hourly rates in part based on first\n\nhand appraisal of counsel's ability, should not be reviewable\n\nexcept  for  special reason.    Nor  can  I  sympathize  with\n\nplaintiffs'  unexplained and  persistent disregard  of formal\n\nmethodology  rules.   I  am much  troubled,  however, by  the\n\ndistrict court's approach to a primary issue in the case, the\n\ntime  devoted to  the state  claim that  would not  have been\n\nspent  had that  issue not  been included.   The  federal and\n\nstate cases were not separate, but were totally related, even\n\nwith, as  defendant concedes, identical witnesses.   The only\n\ndifference  was that federal recovery, at  that time, did not\n\ninclude compensatory damages.   Even here there was a special\n\nconnection in that plaintiffs were obliged to  show, even for\n\nthe  federal count,  that their own,  conceded participation,\n\nwas unenjoyable and involuntary.  In this circumstance, total\n\ndisregard of hours charged for such items as conferences with\n\nclients;   contacts   with   counsel  for   defendants,   and\n\npreparation for,  and taking  of the deposition  of defendant\n\nSmith,  the principal  harasser, on  the ground  that counsel\n\n                             -15-\n\ncannot   allocate  and  subtract,  imposes  an  extraordinary\n\nburden.\n\n          As my  brothers say,  this might be  an appropriate\n\noccasion to adopt the suggestion in Hensley v.

Rivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111730\"><a href=\"/opinion/111730/riverside-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  574-576\n                                   \n\n(1986), the Court said,\n\n          Unlike  most  private  tort litigants,  a\n          civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate\n          important civil and constitutional rights\n          that  cannot be valued solely in monetary\n          terms. . . .\n\n               Because   damages   awards  do   not\n          reflect fully the public benefit advanced\n          by civil rights litigation,  Congress did\n          not  intend  for  fees  in  civil  rights\n          cases, unlike most  private law cases, to\n          depend on  obtaining substantial monetary\n          relief. . . .\n\n               Thus,   Congress   recognized   that\n          reasonable  attorney's fees  under   1988\n          are not conditioned upon and need not  be\n          proportionate  to  an   award  of   money\n          damages.\n\n                             -16-\n\nPlaintiffs had achieved the  maximum possible recovery on the\n\nfederal claims, including an order against defendant employer\n\nto  improve its  internal procedures  with respect  to sexual\n\nharassment.  By its  dwelling at length on the  state dollars\n\nsought   and,  though   not  applying   them  mathematically,\n\nconcluding the federal claim \"minor\" I cannot but  think that\n\nthe district court greatly  depreciated the Civil Rights Act,\n\nseriously   impairing   its  discretion.     I   would  favor\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                             -17-\n</pre>",
