Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF Dkt. No. 52); Pl.’s Cross Mot. for\n\nSumm. J. (ECF Dkt. No. 71) (“Pl.’s Cross Mot.”). Jurisdiction lies pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1581(a) (2006). At issue is the proper classification of Streetsurfing’s waveboards, the “Ripple\n\nBoard” and “The Wave” (collectively, “merchandise” or “waveboards”).\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 2\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth below, defendant’s motion for summary judgment is granted,\n\nplaintiff’s cross-motion for summary judgment is denied, and the court finds that plaintiff’s\n\nwaveboards are properly classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\n\n(“HTSUS”) 1 subheading 9506.99.60.\n\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       The facts described below have been taken from the parties’ USCIT Rule 56(h)\n\nstatements. Citation to the record is provided where a fact, although not admitted in the parties’\n\npapers, is uncontroverted by record evidence.\n\n       The merchandise at issue is the “Ripple Board” and “The Wave,” which are waveboards 2\n\nmanufactured by Streetsurfing. 3 Def.’s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts ¶¶\n\n\n\n\n       1\n                “The HTSUS scheme is organized by headings, each of which has one or more\nsubheadings; the headings set forth general categories of merchandise, and the subheadings\nprovide a more particularized segregation of the goods within each category.” Wilton Indus.,\nInc. v. United States, 741 F.3d 1263, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\n       2\n                 “Waveboards” are Streetsurfing’s brand of “casterboards.” Def.’s Statement of\nUndisputed Material Facts ¶ 2 (ECF Dkt. No. 52). “Casterboards” are “a two-wheeled, human-\npowered land vehicle.” Ex. A, at 1, Mem. of Streetsurfing LLC in Supp. of Pl.’s Cross-mot. for\nSumm. J. and Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF Dkt. No. 71) (“Pl.’s Br.”). They\npossess “[t]wo narrow platforms known as ‘decks[,]’ [and] are joined by a ‘torsion bar[,]’ which\nconsists of a metal beam, usually coated by rubber, that houses a strong spring.” Ex. A, at 1,\nPl.’s Br. Casterboards also use “[o]ne polyurethane wheel [that] is connected to each deck with a\ncaster so that . . . each wheel can steer independently, and each caster has a steering axis that is\ntilted about 30° back from the vertical.” Ex. A, at 1, Pl.’s Br; see also Appendix infra.\n       3\n               The Ripple Board and The Wave are described by the parties as identical to one\nanother in terms of their components and the ride offered to their users. See Def.’s Statement of\nUndisputed Material Facts ¶¶ 5, 6 (ECF Dkt. No. 52) (“The ‘Wave Ripple Board’ model offers\nthe same ride as The Wave, but it is for younger riders.”). The parties, however, have provided\nthe court only with a sample of The Wave. See Appendix infra.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 3\n\n\n2, 3 (ECF Dkt. No. 52) (“Def.’s Statement”). Streetsurfing’s patent for the waveboards describes\n\nthe merchandise as a “skateboard having a front board, [a] rear board, a connecting element\n\nwhich interconnects the front board and the rear board in a spaced relationship, [and] at least one\n\ndirection-caster 4 mounted on the underside of each of the front board and the rear board.” Def.’s\n\nStatement ¶ 17 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike a traditional\n\nskateboard, however, the waveboards possess two wheels and two flexible platforms that can\n\npartially rotate, rather than four wheels and a single inflexible platform. See Appendix infra;\n\nDef.’s Statement ¶ 6. The waveboards are propelled “by the rider pushing his back foot forward\n\nor back, or moving the whole board in a transverse wave motion. This form of propulsion allows\n\nthe rider to move uphill as well as downhill.” Def.’s Statement ¶ 7. Moreover, “[o]nce on the\n\nboard, and riding, . . . the rider [can] turn or even propel the board forward without removing his\n\nor her feet from the board.” Ex. A, at 2, Mem. of Streetsurfing LLC in Supp. of Pl.’s Cross-mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. and Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF Dkt. No. 71) (“Pl.’s Br.”).\n\nThus, to ride the waveboard, users must coordinate their balance, steering, and propulsion all at\n\nonce. Def.’s Statement ¶ 24.\n\n       After importation, Streetsurfing, which “describes itself as a sporting goods product and\n\nlifestyle company,” sells its waveboards to large retail stores (e.g., Walmart), toy stores (e.g.,\n\nToys “R” Us), sporting goods stores (e.g., Dick’s Sporting Goods and Modell’s Sporting Goods),\n\nand online retailers (e.g., Amazon.com, Shopping.com, Sportchalet.com, and Getboards.com).\n\nDef.’s Statement ¶ 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); Ex. G, at 8, Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s First\n\n\n\n       4\n                A “caster” is a “small wheel on a swivel, attached under a piece of furniture or\nother heavy object to make it easier to move.” AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE\nENGLISH LANGUAGE 290 (4th ed. 2000). Here, the casters are one-directional because, unlike a\ntraditional skateboard, the waveboards can only be propelled in the direction of the board’s nose.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 4\n\n\nInterrogatories and Request for Production of Documents and Things (ECF Dkt. No. 52-4). In\n\ntoy stores, such as Toys “R” Us, the waveboards are sold in the “wheeled sporting goods aisles”\n\nnext to skateboards. Ex. B, at 8, Report of Findings Related to the Case by Robert F. Valerio\n\n(ECF Dkt. No. 52-1). Plaintiff markets its waveboards as “a new sport that combines the natural\n\nfluidity of surfing with the smooth maneuverability of snowboarding and skating into one new\n\naction sport known as Street Surfing.” Def.’s Statement ¶ 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Streetsurfing LLC, the importer of record of the merchandise in question, entered twenty-\n\nsix shipments of waveboards between June 2007 and September 2007 at the Port of Los Angeles,\n\nCalifornia. Def.’s Statement ¶ 1; Summons at 3–4 (ECF Dkt. No. 1). Upon liquidation 5 of the\n\nentries, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (“Customs”) classified the waveboards\n\nunder HTSUS 9506.99.60, 6 which covers “Articles and equipment for general physical exercise,\n\ngymnastics, athletics, other sports (including table-tennis) or outdoor games, not specified or\n\nincluded elsewhere in this chapter; swimming pools and wading pools; parts and accessories\n\nthereof: Other: Other: Other,” at 4% ad valorem. Pl.’s Statement of Material Facts as to Which\n\nNo Genuine Issue Exists ¶ 3 (ECF Dkt. No. 71) (“Pl.’s Statement”). The Explanatory Notes to\n\nthe Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, 4th ed., 95.06 (2007)\n\n(“Explanatory Notes”), which “are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of the various\n\nHTSUS provisions,” expressly list skateboards as covered by HTSUS Heading 9506. N. Am.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n               “Liquidation means the final computation or ascertainment of duties on entries for\nconsumption or drawback entries.” 19 C.F.R. § 159.1 (2012); see also Shinyei Corp. of Am. v.\nUnited States, 524 F.3d 1274, 1276–77 (Fed. Cir. 2008).\n       6\n              Plaintiff’s Summons and Cross Motion for Summary Judgment appear to\nmisidentify Customs’ classification of the merchandise as under HTSUS 9506.91.00. See\nSummons 2; Pl.’s Cross Mot. at 1. The record, however, demonstrates clearly that plaintiff’s\nwaveboards were classified under HTSUS 9506.99.60.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 5\n\n\nProcessing Co. v. United States, 236 F.3d 695, 698 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citation omitted);\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.06.\n\n       Plaintiff submitted a timely protest of Customs’ tariff classification on October 29, 2008\n\n(Protest No. 2704-08-103793), which was subsequently denied by Customs. See Summons 1.\n\nAfter paying all required duties, plaintiff commenced this action, claiming that Customs erred in\n\nits classification of the merchandise as “sports equipment” under HTSUS\n\n9506.99.60. See Pl.’s Br. 17. Rather, plaintiff urges that the merchandise should have been\n\nclassified as “other wheeled toys,” and thus, should be reliquidated under HTSUS 9503 which\n\ncovers “Tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and similar wheeled toys; dolls’ carriages; dolls, other\n\ntoys; reduced-scale (‘scale’) models and similar recreational models, working or not; puzzles of\n\nall kinds; parts and accessories thereof.” See Pl.’s Br. 7–8. Heading 9503 is duty-free.\n\n\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       Summary judgment shall be granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” USCIT R.\n\n56(a); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). “When both parties move\n\nfor summary judgment, the court must evaluate each motion on its own merits, resolving all\n\nreasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.” JVC Co. of Am.,\n\nDiv. of US JVC Corp. v. United States, 234 F.3d 1348, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citing McKay v.\n\nUnited States, 199 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). In the context of a classification action,\n\n“summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to the underlying factual\n\nissue of exactly what the merchandise is.” Bausch & Lomb, Inc. v. United States, 148 F.3d 1363,\n\n1365 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 6\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\nI.     LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\n       The objective in a classification case is to determine the correct tariff provision for the\n\nsubject merchandise. See Jarvis Clark Co. v. United States, 733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed. Cir. 1984).\n\nThis Court reviews Customs’ classification decisions de novo. Sony Elecs., Inc. v. United States,\n\n37 CIT __, __, Slip Op. 13-153, at 4 (2013) (citing CamelBak Prods., LLC v. United States, 649\n\nF.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). In reaching its conclusions, the Court engages in a two-step\n\ninquiry: first, it “must construe the meaning of terms in a given tariff provision.” Deckers Corp.\n\nv. United States, 752 F.3d 949, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (citing Orlando Food Corp. v. United\n\nStates, 140 F.3d 1437, 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). “Second, the trial court must determine if the\n\nmerchandise at issue falls within the tariff provision that the court just construed.” Id. (citing\n\nOrlando Food, 140 F.3d at 1439). “The first step is a question of law; the second is a question of\n\nfact.” Dependable Packaging Solutions, Inc. v. United States, 37 CIT __, __, Slip Op. 13-23, at\n\n7 (2013) (citing Pomeroy Collection, Ltd. v. United States, 35 CIT __, __, 783 F. Supp. 2d 1257,\n\n1259 (2011)).\n\n       The General Rules of Interpretation (“GRI”) “govern classifications of imported goods\n\nunder [the] HTSUS and [are] appl[ied] in numerical order.” CamelBak, 649 F.3d at 1364 (citing\n\nBASF Corp. v. United States, 482 F.3d 1324, 1325–26 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). “Under GRI 1, the\n\ncourt must determine the appropriate classification ‘according to the terms of the headings and\n\nany relative section or chapter notes.’” Millenium Lumber Distribution Ltd. v. United States, 558\n\nF.3d 1326, 1328–29 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting GRI 1, HTSUS). Only after a court has\n\n“determin[ed] that a product is classifiable under the heading[, may it] look to [a] subheading[].”\n\nOrlando Food, 140 F.3d at 1440 (citation omitted). “In other words, tariff headings are\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 7\n\n\nconstrued without reference to their subheadings. Accordingly, a court should not look to\n\nsubheadings to either limit or broaden the scope of a heading.” Dependable Packaging, 37 CIT\n\nat __, Slip Op. 13-23, at 7 (citing Orlando Food, 140 F.3d at 1440).\n\n       This Court is further directed to interpret “[t]he terms of the HTSUS . . . according to\n\ntheir common commercial meanings.” Millenium Lumber, 558 F.3d at 1329 (citing Len-Ron\n\nMfg. Co. v. United States, 334 F.3d 1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). In doing so, “the court may\n\nrely on its own understanding of the term as well as upon lexicographic and scientific\n\nauthorities.” Len-Ron, 334 F.3d at 1309 (citing Mita Copystar Am. v. United States, 21 F.3d\n\n1079, 1082 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).\n\n       As noted, “[t]he court may also refer to the Explanatory Notes accompanying a tariff\n\nsubheading.” Id. (citing Mita, 21 F.3d at 1082). Although the Explanatory Notes do “not\n\nconstitute controlling legislative history[, they] are intended to clarify the scope of HTSUS\n\nsubheadings and to offer guidance in interpreting” the HTSUS. Mita, 21 F.3d at 1082 (citing\n\nLynteq, Inc. v. United States, 976 F.2d 693, 696 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). Therefore, although “not\n\nlegally binding or dispositive,” the Explanatory Notes “may be consulted for guidance and are\n\ngenerally indicative of the proper interpretation of the various HTSUS provisions.” N. Am.\n\nProcessing, 236 F.3d at 698 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\nII.    CLASSIFICATION UNDER HEADINGS 9503 AND 9506\n\n       The court finds, and the parties agree, that the waveboards should be classified under\n\nHTSUS chapter 95, which covers “Toys, games and sports equipment; parts and accessories\n\nthereof.” The parties’ dispute is under which specific heading the merchandise should be\n\nclassified. Defendant maintains that the appropriate heading for classification of the\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 8\n\n\nmerchandise is HTSUS 9506.99.60, while plaintiff claims that the proper heading is 9503.00.00.\n\nMem. in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. 3 (ECF Dkt. No. 52) (“Def.’s Br.”); Pl.’s Br. 6. The\n\nparties are correct that plaintiff’s proposed heading, 9503.00.00, is a principal use provision, 7\n\nwhile the heading under which Customs classified the merchandise, 9506.99.60, is a residual\n\nprovision. Processed Plastics Co. v. United States, 473 F.3d 1164, 1170 (Fed. Cir. 2006);\n\nRollerblade, Inc. v. United States, 282 F.3d 1349, 1351, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Def.’s Reply\n\nMem. in Further Supp. of its Mot. for Summ. J. and in Opp’n to Pl.’s Cross-mot. for Summ. J. 2\n\n(ECF Dkt. No. 87); Reply of Streetsurfing LLC in Supp. of Pl.’s Cross-mot. for Summ. J. 1–2\n\n(ECF Dkt. No. 93). Thus, if the merchandise is prima facie classifiable under the more specific\n\nheading of 9503, HTSUS, urged by plaintiff, it cannot be classified under Heading 9506,\n\nHTSUS. See BASF Corp., 482 F.3d at 1326.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n                 Principal use provisions are governed by HTSUS Additional U.S. Rule of\nInterpretation 1, which states, in part, that “a tariff classification controlled by use (other than\nactual use) is to be determined in accordance with the use in the United States at, or immediately\nprior to, the date of importation, of goods of that class or kind to which the imported goods\nbelong, and the controlling use is the principal use.” ARI 1, HTSUS (2012). “The rule ‘call[s]\nfor a determination as to the group of goods that are commercially fungible with the imported\ngoods.’” BenQ Am. Corp. v. United States, 646 F.3d 1371, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Primal Lite, Inc. v. United States, 182 F.3d 1362, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). The\nterm “‘[p]rincipal use’ in this context has been defined as the use ‘which exceeds any other\nsingle use.’” Aromont USA, Inc. v. United States, 671 F.3d 1310, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting\nLenox Collections v. United States, 20 CIT 194, 196 (1996)). “[T]he purpose of ‘principal use’\nprovisions in the HTSUS is to classify particular merchandise according to the ordinary use of\nsuch merchandise, even though particular imported goods may be put to some atypical use.”\nBenQ Am. Corp., 646 F.3d at 1380 (citing Primal Lite, 182 F.3d at 1364).\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                                Page 9\n\n\nIII.      THE WAVEBOARDS ARE NOT PROPERLY CLASSIFIABLE UNDER HEADING 9503 AS\n          WHEELED TOYS\n\n       A. Construction of Heading 9503\n\n          Plaintiff’s preferred HTSUS Heading 9503 covers “Tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and\n\nsimilar wheeled toys; dolls’ carriages; dolls, other toys; reduced-scale (‘scale’) models and\n\nsimilar recreational models, working or not; puzzles of all kinds; parts and accessories thereof.”\n\nThe Explanatory Notes describe wheeled toys as\n\n          articles . . . usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers\n          or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or\n          rod, or, as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s foot\n          against the ground. Other types of wheeled toys may be simply drawn or pushed\n          by another person or driven by a motor.\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.03. Further, the exemplars identified in the Explanatory Note to Heading\n\n9503 include the following items:\n\n          (1) Children’s tricycles and the like, but excluding bicycles of heading 87.12.\n\n          (2) Two- or three-wheeled scooters designed to be ridden by children, as well as\n          youngsters and adults, with an adjustable or non-adjustable steering column and\n          small solid or inflatable wheels. They are sometimes equipped with a bicycle-\n          type handle-bar, a hand brake or a foot brake on the rear wheel.\n\n          (3) Pedal- or hand-propelled wheeled toys in the form of animals.\n\n          (4) Pedal cars, frequently in the form of miniature sports cars, jeeps, lorries, etc.\n\n          (5) Wheeled toys, propelled by hand levers.\n\n          (6) Other wheeled toys (with no mechanical transmission system) which are\n          designed to be drawn or pushed, and are large enough for children to ride.\n\n          (7) Children’s cars powered by a motor.\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.03. As noted, although the Explanatory Notes “are not legally binding or\n\ndispositive, they may be consulted for guidance and are generally indicative of the proper\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 10\n\n\ninterpretation of the various HTSUS provisions.” N. Am. Processing, 236 F.3d at 698 (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n        Classification as a toy under HTSUS Heading 9503 requires that the article be principally\n\nused as a toy. See StoreWALL, LLC v. United States, 644 F.3d 1358, 1365–66 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2011). Toys have been found to include “‘articles whose principal use is amusement,\n\ndiversion, or play, rather than practicality.’” Processed Plastics, 473 F.3d at 1169, 1170 (quoting\n\nMinnetonka Brands, Inc. v. United States, 24 CIT 645, 651, 110 F. Supp. 2d 1020, 1027 (2000))\n\n(“We agree with the standard adopted in Minnetonka to determine whether merchandise should\n\nbe classified as a toy.”).\n\n        Plaintiff insists that its waveboards are specifically covered by Heading 9503 because\n\nthey are wheeled toys principally used for amusement. Pl.’s Br. 10. Thus, plaintiff reasons that,\n\nbecause the merchandise is principally used for amusement, it is prima facie classifiable only\n\nunder Heading 9503 and cannot fall under the less specific heading, 9506.\n\n        While the court is mindful that in Processed Plastics the Federal Circuit found that\n\n“wheeled toys” under HTSUS Heading 9503 must be principally used for amusement, the\n\nExplanatory Note accompanying this heading makes clear that the provision is narrower than\n\nplaintiff claims. That is, Heading 9503 does not cover every item with wheels that is principally\n\nused for amusement, as plaintiff would have the court hold. Rather, the Explanatory Notes\n\nindicate that, in addition to being principally used for amusement, a wheeled toy properly\n\nclassifiable under HTSUS Heading 9503 is also characterized by other common features.\n\n        For example, the exemplars listed in the Explanatory Notes, such as children’s tricycles,\n\npedal cars, and wheeled cars designed to be drawn or pushed, and large enough for children to\n\nride, are all items that require no training prior to their use and involve no meaningful risk of\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 11\n\n\ninjury. Rather, these items can be safely used by a child, with minimal supervision, and without\n\nprior instruction.\n\n        In addition, items, such as pedal cars and wheeled toys designed to be drawn or pushed\n\nwith a child riding inside, involve no development or practice of individual skills in order for\n\nthem to be used to their maximum capacity. Nor do these items afford a user a reasonable\n\ndegree of exercise or physical activity. That is, there is no minimum degree of skill required in\n\norder to fully use a wheeled toy, and wheeled toys do not provide notable exercise or require\n\nathletic ability.\n\n        Further, as noted, all articles listed as wheeled toys are propelled “by means of pedals,\n\nhand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, .\n\n. . by direct pressure of a person’s foot against the ground,” or by “simply [being] drawn or\n\npushed by another person or driven by a motor.” Explanatory Notes 95.03. Thus, wheeled toys\n\nall conform to a general design, characterized by the support of an assistive device, such as one\n\nor more seats, additional wheels, hand levers, handle bars, pedals, or breaks.\n\n        Accordingly, in addition to being an item with wheels that is used principally for\n\namusement, a wheeled toy under Heading 9503 is also characterized by the following features:\n\n(1) the absence of a training requirement prior to its use; (2) the absence of a meaningful risk of\n\ninjury involved in its use; (3) the lack of acquired skill to fully utilize the item; (4) the lack of\n\nexercise or athletic aspect in the item’s use; and (5) the presence of an assistive device.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 12\n\n\n   B. Heading 9503 Does Not Cover the Waveboards\n\n           1. Need for Training\n\n       Both parties agree that riding the waveboard requires the coordination of a user’s balance,\n\nsteering, and propulsion in unison. Def.’s Statement ¶ 24. As a result, the waveboards are\n\npackaged with a tutorial video that demonstrates how to safely ride the merchandise, and similar\n\ninstructional material is also available on Streetsurfing’s website. See Ex. A, Instructional DVD\n\nfor the Sample of The Wave (“Instructional DVD”); Ex. G, at 23, Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s First\n\nInterrogatories and Request for Production of Documents and Things. In addition, Streetsurfing\n\nemployed professional instructors to “visit[] thousands of schools and t[each] millions of\n\nstudents how to ride” its waveboards. Def.’s Statement ¶ 29 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThus, it is apparent that, unlike wheeled toys, riding waveboards require more than merely\n\nstepping onto the device and setting off. That the waveboards require a certain level of training\n\nprior to their use separates them from wheeled toys.\n\n       Thus, the presence of this additional feature in the use of the waveboards, the requirement\n\nof training prior to use, weighs against classifying the merchandise under Heading 9503 as\n\nwheeled toys.\n\n\n\n           2. Meaningful Risk of Injury\n\n       Another distinctive characteristic of a wheeled toy under HTSUS Heading 9503 is that\n\nthe item’s use does not involve any meaningful risk of injury. Here, as evidenced by the\n\nproduct’s labeling and other record evidence, a waveboard’s use carries a meaningful risk of\n\ninjury that is lacking with the wheeled toy exemplars of HTSUS Heading 9503. According to\n\nplaintiff, its waveboards are prohibited in over ninety percent of the skate parks in the United\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 13\n\n\nStates “because they are dangerous in the parks.” Pl.’s Statement ¶ 8 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Moreover, The Wave itself and the box in which it is packaged and sold state that the\n\nmerchandise contains a safety manual that should be read prior to its use, that protective gear\n\nshould be worn at all times, and that adult supervision is required. See Ex. A, Sample of The\n\nWave (“WARNING[:] . . . Children require competent adult supervision.”); Ex. A, Box of the\n\nSample of The Wave (“READ AND UNDERSTAND THE ENCLOSED SAFETY MANUAL\n\nBEFORE RIDING. ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY EQUIPMENT SUCH AS A HELMET, KNEE\n\nPADS, AND ELBOW PADS WHILE RIDING. . . . COMPETENT ADULT SUPERVISION\n\nRECOMMENDED.”).\n\n        Hence, unlike the wheeled toy items listed by the Explanatory Notes as classifiable under\n\nHTSUS Heading 9503, the waveboards do involve a meaningful risk of injury to users, therefore\n\nfurther indicating that the merchandise falls outside the realm of what constitutes a wheeled toy.\n\n\n\n            3. Skill\n\n        In addition to possessing wheels and being principally used for amusement, the wheeled\n\ntoy examples found in the Explanatory Notes require no acquisition of skill by their riders in\n\norder to get the maximum use from the toys. It is clear to the court that the waveboards do not\n\nshare this quality, and to the contrary, require that a user acquire a certain level of skill to fully\n\nuse the merchandise. Therefore, as with a skateboard, users need considerable skill and\n\nexperience in order to develop their technique and master the use of the waveboards in order to\n\nbe able to perform “tricks” or “stunts.” See Ex. A, Instructional DVD; Def.’s Statement ¶ 30.\n\n        Thus, record evidence demonstrates that the waveboards fail to meet this additional\n\nindicator of wheeled toy status: that users need not develop a degree of skill to use, and take full\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 14\n\n\nadvantage of, the waveboards, further showing that classification of the merchandise under\n\nHTSUS Heading 9503 as wheeled toys is improper.\n\n\n\n           4. Exercise\n\n       As to exercise, the exemplars in the Explanatory Note to HTSUS Heading 9503, such as\n\npedal cars, children’s motor cars, wheeled toys propelled by hand levers, or wheeled toys\n\ndesigned to be drawn or pushed, and large enough for children to ride, do not provide their user\n\nwith a workout. The waveboards’ users, on the other hand, get “good exercise,” working their\n\n“lower muscles, . . . the stomach and [their] legs.” Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 20, 21, 22 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Indeed, plaintiff introduced its waveboards to thousands of schools as\n\npart of the schools’ physical education programs, because the waveboards are “a physical\n\nactivity” teaching students “a new skill that works on core stability utilizing balance, weight\n\ntransfer[,] and movement through space.” Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 28, 29.\n\n       Because the waveboards afford users a reasonable degree of exercise or physical activity,\n\nclassification as a wheeled toy under HTSUS Heading 9503 is not appropriate.\n\n\n\n           5. Design\n\n       Another feature that characterizes wheeled toys is their common design. Specifically,\n\nthose items classified under Heading 9503 by the Explanatory Notes all include the presence of\n\nan assistive device. That the waveboards fail to conform to this common design feature further\n\nsupports defendant’s claim that plaintiff’s waveboards cannot be classified as wheeled toys under\n\nHeading 9503.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                            Page 15\n\n\n       As previously discussed, the Explanatory Notes describe wheeled toys under HTSUS\n\nHeading 9503 as\n\n       articles . . . usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers\n       or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or\n       rod, or, as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s foot\n       against the ground. Other types of wheeled toys may be simply drawn or pushed\n       by another person or driven by a motor.\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.03. According to plaintiff, after pushing off with his or her foot, “[t]he\n\nrider on the subject waveboard propels himself by mak[ing] a twisting motion to the left with\n\nrespect to the front board, and biases the board to the left, while the rear board biases to the right,\n\nin order to keep the rider steady. The rider moves forward simply by twisting and releasing the\n\nboards.” Pl.’s Statement ¶ 6. Unlike wheeled toys, waveboards do not possess pedals, hand\n\nlevers, or any other device that transmits power to the wheels. Rather, the waveboards are\n\npropelled forward by the riders shifting their weight from side to side while maintaining their\n\nbalance without the support of an assistive device, such as one or more seats, additional wheels,\n\nhand levers, handle bars, pedals, or brakes, which is present in the exemplars identified by the\n\nExplanatory Notes.\n\n       Accordingly, it weighs further against their classification as wheeled toys that plaintiff’s\n\nwaveboards fail to conform to the design methods presented by the examples found in the\n\nExplanatory Note to Heading 9503.\n\n\n\n           6. Conclusion\n\n       Based on the foregoing, the court finds that the scope of HTSUS Heading 9503 is too\n\nnarrow to encompass the waveboards. Although items with wheels that can provide amusement,\n\nplaintiff’s waveboards fail to conform to the other necessary criteria needed for classification as\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 16\n\n\nwheeled toys under Heading 9503. That is, because plaintiff’s waveboards (1) require training\n\nprior to their use, (2) involve a meaningful risk of injury, (3) require that a user develop a degree\n\nof skill, (4) provide the user with considerable exercise, and (5) do not conform to the design of\n\nwheeled toys because they do not employ an assistive device for users, the waveboards lack the\n\nnecessary elements for classification as wheeled toys. Accordingly, the waveboards cannot be\n\nclassified as such under HTSUS Heading 9503.\n\n\n\nIV.      THE WAVEBOARDS ARE PROPERLY CLASSIFIABLE UNDER HEADING 9506 AS SPORTS\n         EQUIPMENT OR ARTICLES FOR GENERAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR ATHLETICS\n\n         Because HTSUS Heading 9503 is a principal use provision, it is more specific than\n\nHTSUS Heading 9506, which is a residual provision. See BASF Corp., 482 F.3d at 1326. Thus,\n\nwere the waveboards prima facie classifiable under Heading 9503 as wheeled toys, they would\n\nbe precluded from classification under Heading 9506 as sports equipment or articles for general\n\nphysical exercise or athletics. Because, as has been seen, the waveboards are not properly\n\nclassifiable under HTSUS Heading 9503, the court turns to defendant’s proposed classification.\n\n\n\n      A. Construction of Heading 9506\n\n         HTSUS Heading 9506 encompasses “Articles and equipment for general physical\n\nexercise, gymnastics, athletics, other sports (including table-tennis) or outdoor games, not\n\nspecified or included elsewhere in this chapter; swimming pools and wading pools; parts and\n\naccessories thereof.” The heading’s accompanying Explanatory Note identifies a number of\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 17\n\n\nitems covered by Heading 9506, including snow-skis, water-skis, ice skates, surfboards, roller\n\nskates, and skateboards. 8 Explanatory Notes 95.06.\n\n       This Court has held that an activity falls within the meaning of a “sport” when “[i]t\n\npossesses to a meaningful degree the . . . attributes of healthy, challenging[,] and skillful\n\n       8\n               The complete list of exemplars identified by the Explanatory Note to HTSUS\nHeading 9506 is as follows:\n      (B) Requisites for other sports and outdoor games (other than toys presented in\n      sets, or separately, of heading 95.03), e.g.:\n               (1) Snow-skis and other snow-ski equipment (e.g., ski-fastenings (ski-\n      bindings), ski brakes, ski poles).\n               (2) Water-skis, surf-boards, sailboards and other water-sport equipment,\n      such as diving stages (platforms), chutes, divers’ flippers and respiratory masks of\n      a kind used without oxygen or compressed air bottles, and simple underwater\n      breathing tubes (generally known as ‘snorkels’) for swimmers or divers.\n               (3) Golf clubs and other golf equipment, such as golf balls, golf tees.\n               (4) Articles and equipment for table-tennis (ping-pong), such as tables\n      (with or without legs), bats (paddles), balls and nets.\n               (5) Tennis, badminton or similar rackets (e.g., squash rackets), whether or\n      not strung.\n               (6) Balls, other than golf balls and table-tennis balls, such as tennis balls,\n      footballs, rugby balls and similar balls (including bladders and covers for such\n      balls); water polo, basketball and similar valve type balls; cricket balls.\n               (7) Ice skates and roller skates, including skating boots with skates\n      attached.\n               (8) Sticks and bats for hockey, cricket, lacrosse, etc.; chistera (jai alai\n      scoops); pucks for ice hockey; curling stones.\n               (9) Nets for various games (tennis, badminton, volleyball, football,\n      basketball, etc.).\n               (10) Fencing equipment: fencing foils, sabres and rapiers and their parts\n      (e.g., blades, guards, hilts and buttons or stops), etc.\n               (11) Archery equipment, such as bows, arrows and targets.\n               (12) Equipment of a kind used in children’s playgrounds (e.g., swings,\n      slides, see-saws and giant strides).\n               (13) Protective equipment for sports or games, e.g., fencing masks and\n      breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards, ice hockey pants\n      with built-in guards and pads.\n               (14) Other articles and equipment, such as requisites for deck tennis,\n      quoits or bowls; skate boards; racket presses; mallets for polo or croquet;\n      boomerangs; ice axes; clay pigeons and clay pigeon projectors; bobsleighs\n      (bobsleds), luges and similar non-motorised vehicles for sliding on snow or ice.\nExplanatory Notes 95.06 (emphasis added).\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 18\n\n\nrecreation.” Newman Importing Co. v. United States, 76 Cust. Ct. 143, 143, 415 F. Supp. 375,\n\n376 (1976). In Newman, the Court rejected the claim “that a sport must involve competition\n\neither between individuals or against the natural elements.” Id. Moreover, “[t]o qualify as\n\n‘equipment’ for a sport, the good should generally provide ‘what is necessary, useful, or\n\nappropriate [for that sport].” Lemans Corp. v. United States, 660 F.3d 1311, 1318 (Fed. Cir.\n\n2011) (alterations in original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The parties\n\nagree that the waveboards are the only piece of equipment necessary to engage in “streetsurfing.”\n\nSee Pl.’s Br. 17–18; Def.’s Br. 3.\n\n\n\n    B. The Presence of Organized Competition and Rules for an Activity Is Not Dispositive\n       as to Whether Articles Used to Participate in That Activity Are Classifiable Under\n       Heading 9506\n\n        Plaintiff contends that its waveboards are not sports equipment, and thus, not classifiable\n\nas such under Heading 9506, because waveboarding is not a sport. Pl.’s Br. 17. For plaintiff,\n\nbecause waveboarding is not recognized by the general public as a sport and does not possess\n\nspecific rules or involve competition, its merchandise cannot be covered by Heading 9506. See\n\nPl.’s Br. 22.\n\n        This Court’s previous holdings make clear that an activity qualifies as a “sport” when it\n\nprovides “skillful recreation.” Newman, 76 Cust. Ct. at 143, 415 F. Supp. at 376. In Newman,\n\nthe Court held that backpacking is a sport and rejected the “contention that a sport must involve\n\ncompetition either between individuals or against the natural elements.” Id. Rather than\n\ncompetitiveness, the Court explained that what is indicative of a sport is an activity involving\n\n“the element of enjoyment or recreation arising from the development or practice of individual\n\nskills.” Id. at 144, 415 F. Supp. at 376.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                               Page 19\n\n\n       By way of contrast, in Camel Manufacturing Co. v. United States, this Court found that\n\n“camping out” is not a sport. Camel Mfg. Co. v. United States, 12 CIT 426, 427–28, 686 F.\n\nSupp. 912, 913 (1988). In doing so, the Court narrowed the holding in Newman, cautioning that\n\nnot every activity that contains “a certain degree of challenge and skill . . . [can] be considered a\n\nsport.” Id. at 427, 686 F. Supp. at 913. The Court explained, however, that the purpose of the\n\nholding in Newman was to “prevent[] a superficial standard of interpersonal competition from\n\nbecoming the identifying essence of sports.” Id. at 428, 686 F. Supp. at 914.\n\n       Plaintiff’s position that its waveboards do not qualify as sporting goods because\n\n“waveboarding” does not possess set rules or regular competition is without merit. This Court’s\n\nholdings in Newman and Camel Manufacturing sensibly found that competition or a set of\n\norganized rules are not essential to the determination of whether an activity is a sport.\n\n       Indeed, the exemplars identified in the Explanatory Note to HTSUS Heading 9506\n\nsupport this conclusion. The presence of listed items, such as children’s playground equipment\n\n(e.g., swings, slides, and seesaws), equipment for snorkeling and diving, and ice axes, indicate\n\nthat the drafters did not intend to limit the heading’s scope to activities that incorporate a\n\ncompetitive structure, a formal league, or rules. Further, despite the presence of competition in\n\nthe use of roller skates (e.g., roller derbies) or skateboards, for example, roller skates and\n\nskateboards are not primarily used in organized competition, nor is the common use of these\n\nitems characterized by sets of rules.\n\n       It is clear, then, that the scope of Heading 9506 encompasses more than plaintiff claims,\n\nand includes merchandise used for general physical exercise and athletics, in addition to articles\n\nused for organized and competitive sports. Thus, whether “waveboarding” possesses formal\n\nrules or involves organized competition is not only not dispositive to the question of whether the\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 20\n\n\nactivity is a sport, but it also is not relevant to the classification of plaintiff’s merchandise under\n\nHeading 9506, which also covers articles for general physical exercise or athletics.\n\n        Thus, it is evident that whether “waveboarding” is a sport with formal rules or\n\ncompetition is not determinative of whether plaintiff’s waveboards qualify for coverage under\n\nHeading 9506.\n\n\n\n    C. The Waveboards Possess the Necessary Features to Qualify for Coverage Under\n       HTSUS Heading 9506\n\n        As noted, the Explanatory Notes are regularly used by this Court to determine the intent\n\nof the drafters with respect to the provisions of the HTSUS. See Mita, 21 F.3d at 1082. In this\n\ninstance, the Explanatory Note accompanying Heading 9506 provides the court with additional\n\ninsight as to those items with wheels that are intended to be classified under Heading 9506 as\n\nsporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or athletics. Because the waveboards\n\nconform to the features that characterize items covered by HTSUS Heading 9506, the heading\n\nencompasses plaintiff’s merchandise.\n\n\n\n            1. Training\n\n        After reviewing the exemplars listed under HTSUS Heading 9506, it is clear that a\n\ncommon element among those items with wheels listed as sports equipment or articles for\n\ngeneral physical exercise or athletics (e.g., skateboards and roller skates) is that the items’ users\n\nrequire a certain degree of training prior to their use. Moreover, generally, the non-wheeled\n\narticles listed under the Explanatory Note for Heading 9506, such as snow- and water-ski\n\nequipment, golf clubs, equipment for racket sports, ice skates, and archery and fencing\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 21\n\n\nequipment, all require prior training. 9 A child or adult user would be unable to employ any one\n\nof these items with meaningful precision or effectiveness without prior instruction.\n\n        As has been set out earlier in this opinion, prior training is required in order to ride\n\nwaveboards. Users require prior training and practice to be able to enjoy using the waveboards\n\nin any meaningful capacity, which requires that riders be able to balance themselves on the\n\nboard, propel the board forward, and steer the board all at once. See Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 23, 24.\n\nThis training requirement indicates that the waveboards qualify as sporting goods or articles for\n\ngeneral physical exercise or athletics under HTSUS Heading 9506.\n\n\n\n            2. Skill\n\n        A review of the accompanying Explanatory Note for HTSUS Heading 9506 also makes\n\nclear that those items classified under HTSUS 9506 (e.g., water-skis, surfboards, skateboards, ice\n\nskates, tennis rackets, ice hockey equipment, and archery equipment) require that one develop a\n\ndegree of skill in order to take full advantage of the products. Indeed, this observation is\n\nsupported by this Court’s prior holding in Newman. See Newman, 76 Cust. Ct. at 144, 415 F.\n\nSupp. at 376 (“In any event the element of enjoyment or recreation arising from the development\n\nor practice of individual skills, different from those involved in routine daily activities, is a better\n\nindication of a sport than competitiveness.” (emphasis added)).\n\n        As previously discussed, record evidence shows that users must acquire a degree of skill\n\nin order to be proficient in riding the waveboards and take full advantage of the merchandise.\n\nWhile a rider, with prior training, may be able to use the waveboards in a limited fashion, it is\n\n\n\n\n        9\n             The notable exception to this finding is playground equipment, items far removed\nfrom waveboards.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 22\n\n\nwith further practice and the acquisition of a greater degree of skill that users will be able to\n\nexpand on the product’s uses. As demonstrated by Streetsurfing’s sales literature and\n\ninstructional DVD packaged with the merchandise, users with greater skill are able to ride the\n\nwaveboards with greater speed and a higher degree of precision, on more uncertain terrain (e.g.,\n\nhills and sidewalks), and may even become proficient enough to perform “tricks” and “stunts”\n\nsimilar to those performed using a skateboard. See Ex. A, Instructional DVD; Def.’s Statement ¶\n\n30. Skill is required for a rider to take full advantage of the articles covered by HTSUS Heading\n\n9506, and the presence of this element further favors classification of plaintiff’s waveboards\n\nunder this heading, as sporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or athletics.\n\n\n\n           3. Exercise\n\n       Another common feature exhibited by the exemplars listed by the Explanatory Note for\n\nHTSUS Heading 9506 is that the activities for which the listed items are used afford a user a\n\nreasonable degree of exercise or physical activity. As noted, record evidence shows that using\n\nthe waveboards provides users with a workout, giving them “good exercise,” working their\n\n“lower muscles, . . . the stomach and [their] legs.” Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 20, 21, 22 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The listed exemplars all provide users with meaningful exercise and a\n\nreasonable degree of physical activity, whether it be equipment used for skiing, racket sports,\n\nfencing, water sports and activities, or even children’s playground equipment.\n\n       Therefore, because plaintiff’s waveboards conform to the additional features that\n\ncharacterize those items that, according to the Explanatory Notes, are properly classified as\n\nsporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or athletics, the classification of the\n\nwaveboards under HTSUS Heading 9506 is favored.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 23\n\n\n   D. The Court’s Examination of the Merchandise\n\n       As this Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have confirmed, “the\n\nmerchandise itself is often a potent witness in classification cases.” Simod Am. Corp. v. United\n\nStates, 872 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (citation omitted); see also Dependable Packaging,\n\n37 CIT at __, Slip Op. 13-23, at 17 (citation omitted); Lerner N.Y., Inc. v. United States, 37 CIT\n\n__, __, 908 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1318 (2013) (citation omitted). Having examined the sample of\n\nThe Wave supplied by the parties and its accompanying instructional DVD, in the court’s view,\n\nplaintiff’s waveboards are akin to skateboards. See Appendix infra. Although there are certain\n\nminor distinguishable characteristics between the items, plaintiff’s waveboards are undeniably\n\nalmost visually identical, as well as duplicative in their components, physical characteristics, and\n\nuse as skateboards. As noted, a skateboard is listed by the Explanatory Notes as an example of\n\nan item that is properly classified as sports equipment or an article for general physical exercise\n\nor athletics under HTSUS Heading 9506.\n\n\n\n   E. Customs Properly Classified the Merchandise Under HTSUS Heading 9506\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Customs properly classified the waveboards under HTSUS\n\n9506.99.60. Despite plaintiff’s arguments to the contrary, this Court has held that the presence\n\nof organized competition and specific rules is not determinative of whether an activity qualifies\n\nas a sport, nor is it determinative of whether the article qualifies for coverage under Heading\n\n9506. That is, the argument that “waveboarding” does not involve competition or possess rules\n\ndoes not aid plaintiff’s case because Heading 9506 is much broader than plaintiff claims and\n\ncovers items in addition to those used for organized sports.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 24\n\n\n         Further, the Explanatory Notes to the two competing tariff provisions indicate that there\n\nare additional criteria that distinguish wheeled items under Heading 9506 from wheeled toys\n\nunder Heading 9503. The use of items qualifying as sports equipment or articles for general\n\nphysical exercise or athletics requires a degree of training and a certain level of skill and\n\nathleticism, which are features absent from the use of wheeled toys, but which characterize\n\nplaintiff’s waveboards. Additionally, the use of the wheeled toy items does not involve any\n\nmeaningful risk of injury, an element that is clearly present in the use of the waveboards, nor do\n\nwheeled toys provide exercise. Moreover, wheeled toys all share a common design, in that they\n\neach possess an assistive device for the user, which is lacking in the waveboards and the\n\nexemplars listed for Heading 9506. Finally, the court’s own examination of the merchandise\n\nonly reaffirms its conclusion that there can be no doubt that the waveboards resemble\n\nskateboards.\n\n         Accordingly, the court finds that Customs properly classified the waveboards under\n\nHTSUS 9506.99.60 because they are sporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or\n\nathletics. See Jarvis Clark, 733 F.2d at 878.\n\n\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n         Based on the foregoing, the court concludes that the correct tariff classification for the\n\nRipple Board and The Wave is subheading 9506.99.60, HTSUS, subject to a duty rate of 4% ad\n\nvalorem. Judgment will enter accordingly.\n\nDated:          September 22, 2014\n                New York, New York\n\n\n                                                                       /s/ Richard K.

At issue is the proper classification of Streetsurfing’s waveboards, the “Ripple\n\nBoard” and “The Wave” (collectively, “merchandise” or “waveboards”).\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 2\n\n\n       For the reasons set forth below, defendant’s motion for summary judgment is granted,\n\nplaintiff’s cross-motion for summary judgment is denied, and the court finds that plaintiff’s\n\nwaveboards are properly classified under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\n\n(“HTSUS”) 1 subheading 9506.99.60.\n\n\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       The facts described below have been taken from the parties’ USCIT Rule 56(h)\n\nstatements.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">741</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2013).\n       2\n                 “Waveboards” are Streetsurfing’s brand of “casterboards.” Def.’s Statement of\nUndisputed Material Facts ¶ 2 (ECF Dkt. No. 52). “Casterboards” are “a two-wheeled, human-\npowered land vehicle.” Ex. A, at 1, Mem. of Streetsurfing LLC in Supp. of Pl.’s Cross-mot. for\nSumm. J. and Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF Dkt. No. 71) (“Pl.’s Br.”). They\npossess “[t]wo narrow platforms known as ‘decks[,]’ [and] are joined by a ‘torsion bar[,]’ which\nconsists of a metal beam, usually coated by rubber, that houses a strong spring.” Ex. A, at 1,\nPl.’s Br. Casterboards also use “[o]ne polyurethane wheel [that] is connected to each deck with a\ncaster so that . . . each wheel can steer independently, and each caster has a steering axis that is\ntilted about 30° back from the vertical.” Ex. A, at 1, Pl.’s Br; see also Appendix infra.\n       3\n               The Ripple Board and The Wave are described by the parties as identical to one\nanother in terms of their components and the ride offered to their users. See Def.’s Statement of\nUndisputed Material Facts ¶¶ 5, 6 (ECF Dkt. No. 52) (“The ‘Wave Ripple Board’ model offers\nthe same ride as The Wave, but it is for younger riders.”). The parties, however, have provided\nthe court only with a sample of The Wave. See Appendix infra.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 3\n\n\n2, 3 (ECF Dkt. No. 52) (“Def.’s Statement”). Streetsurfing’s patent for the waveboards describes\n\nthe merchandise as a “skateboard having a front board, [a] rear board, a connecting element\n\nwhich interconnects the front board and the rear board in a spaced relationship, [and] at least one\n\ndirection-caster 4 mounted on the underside of each of the front board and the rear board.” Def.’s\n\nStatement ¶ 17 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). Unlike a traditional\n\nskateboard, however, the waveboards possess two wheels and two flexible platforms that can\n\npartially rotate, rather than four wheels and a single inflexible platform. See Appendix infra;\n\nDef.’s Statement ¶ 6. The waveboards are propelled “by the rider pushing his back foot forward\n\nor back, or moving the whole board in a transverse wave motion. This form of propulsion allows\n\nthe rider to move uphill as well as downhill.” Def.’s Statement ¶ 7. Moreover, “[o]nce on the\n\nboard, and riding, . . . the rider [can] turn or even propel the board forward without removing his\n\nor her feet from the board.” Ex. A, at 2, Mem. of Streetsurfing LLC in Supp. of Pl.’s Cross-mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. and Resp. in Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF Dkt. No. 71) (“Pl.’s Br.”).\n\nThus, to ride the waveboard, users must coordinate their balance, steering, and propulsion all at\n\nonce. Def.’s Statement ¶ 24.\n\n       After importation, Streetsurfing, which “describes itself as a sporting goods product and\n\nlifestyle company,” sells its waveboards to large retail stores (e.g., Walmart), toy stores (e.g.,\n\nToys “R” Us), sporting goods stores (e.g., Dick’s Sporting Goods and Modell’s Sporting Goods),\n\nand online retailers (e.g., Amazon.com, Shopping.com, Sportchalet.com, and Getboards.com).\n\nDef.’s Statement ¶ 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); Ex. G, at 8, Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s First\n\n\n\n       4\n                A “caster” is a “small wheel on a swivel, attached under a piece of furniture or\nother heavy object to make it easier to move.” AMERICAN HERITAGE DICTIONARY OF THE\nENGLISH LANGUAGE 290 (4th ed. 2000). Here, the casters are one-directional because, unlike a\ntraditional skateboard, the waveboards can only be propelled in the direction of the board’s nose.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 4\n\n\nInterrogatories and Request for Production of Documents and Things (ECF Dkt. No. 52-4). In\n\ntoy stores, such as Toys “R” Us, the waveboards are sold in the “wheeled sporting goods aisles”\n\nnext to skateboards. Ex. B, at 8, Report of Findings Related to the Case by Robert F. Valerio\n\n(ECF Dkt. No. 52-1). Plaintiff markets its waveboards as “a new sport that combines the natural\n\nfluidity of surfing with the smooth maneuverability of snowboarding and skating into one new\n\naction sport known as Street Surfing.” Def.’s Statement ¶ 10 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Streetsurfing LLC, the importer of record of the merchandise in question, entered twenty-\n\nsix shipments of waveboards between June 2007 and September 2007 at the Port of Los Angeles,\n\nCalifornia. Def.’s Statement ¶ 1; Summons at 3–4 (ECF Dkt. No. 1). Upon liquidation 5 of the\n\nentries, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (“Customs”) classified the waveboards\n\nunder HTSUS 9506.99.60, 6 which covers “Articles and equipment for general physical exercise,\n\ngymnastics, athletics, other sports (including table-tennis) or outdoor games, not specified or\n\nincluded elsewhere in this chapter; swimming pools and wading pools; parts and accessories\n\nthereof: Other: Other: Other,” at 4% ad valorem.

Defendant maintains that the appropriate heading for classification of the\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 8\n\n\nmerchandise is HTSUS 9506.99.60, while plaintiff claims that the proper heading is 9503.00.00.\n\nMem. in Supp. of Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. 3 (ECF Dkt. No. 52) (“Def.’s Br.”); Pl.’s Br. 6. The\n\nparties are correct that plaintiff’s proposed heading, 9503.00.00, is a principal use provision, 7\n\nwhile the heading under which Customs classified the merchandise, 9506.99.60, is a residual\n\nprovision.

THE WAVEBOARDS ARE NOT PROPERLY CLASSIFIABLE UNDER HEADING 9503 AS\n          WHEELED TOYS\n\n       A. Construction of Heading 9503\n\n          Plaintiff’s preferred HTSUS Heading 9503 covers “Tricycles, scooters, pedal cars and\n\nsimilar wheeled toys; dolls’ carriages; dolls, other toys; reduced-scale (‘scale’) models and\n\nsimilar recreational models, working or not; puzzles of all kinds; parts and accessories thereof.”\n\nThe Explanatory Notes describe wheeled toys as\n\n          articles . . . usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers\n          or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or\n          rod, or, as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s foot\n          against the ground. Other types of wheeled toys may be simply drawn or pushed\n          by another person or driven by a motor.\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.03. Further, the exemplars identified in the Explanatory Note to Heading\n\n9503 include the following items:\n\n          (1) Children’s tricycles and the like, but excluding bicycles of heading 87.12.\n\n          (2) Two- or three-wheeled scooters designed to be ridden by children, as well as\n          youngsters and adults, with an adjustable or non-adjustable steering column and\n          small solid or inflatable wheels. They are sometimes equipped with a bicycle-\n          type handle-bar, a hand brake or a foot brake on the rear wheel.\n\n          (3) Pedal- or hand-propelled wheeled toys in the form of animals.\n\n          (4) Pedal cars, frequently in the form of miniature sports cars, jeeps, lorries, etc.\n\n          (5) Wheeled toys, propelled by hand levers.\n\n          (6) Other wheeled toys (with no mechanical transmission system) which are\n          designed to be drawn or pushed, and are large enough for children to ride.\n\n          (7) Children’s cars powered by a motor.\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.03. As noted, although the Explanatory Notes “are not legally binding or\n\ndispositive, they may be consulted for guidance and are generally indicative of the proper\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 10\n\n\ninterpretation of the various HTSUS provisions.” N. Am. Processing, 236 F.3d at 698 (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n        Classification as a toy under HTSUS Heading 9503 requires that the article be principally\n\nused as a toy. See StoreWALL, LLC v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213695\"><a href=\"/opinion/213695/storewall-llc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1365–66 (Fed.\n\nCir. 2011). Toys have been found to include “‘articles whose principal use is amusement,\n\ndiversion, or play, rather than practicality.’” Processed Plastics, 473 F.3d at 1169, 1170 (quoting\n\nMinnetonka Brands, Inc. v. United States, 24 CIT 645, 651, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"819482\"><a href=\"/opinion/819482/minnetonka-brands-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1027 (2000))\n\n(“We agree with the standard adopted in Minnetonka to determine whether merchandise should\n\nbe classified as a toy.”).\n\n        Plaintiff insists that its waveboards are specifically covered by Heading 9503 because\n\nthey are wheeled toys principally used for amusement. Pl.’s Br. 10. Thus, plaintiff reasons that,\n\nbecause the merchandise is principally used for amusement, it is prima facie classifiable only\n\nunder Heading 9503 and cannot fall under the less specific heading, 9506.\n\n        While the court is mindful that in Processed Plastics the Federal Circuit found that\n\n“wheeled toys” under HTSUS Heading 9503 must be principally used for amusement, the\n\nExplanatory Note accompanying this heading makes clear that the provision is narrower than\n\nplaintiff claims. That is, Heading 9503 does not cover every item with wheels that is principally\n\nused for amusement, as plaintiff would have the court hold. Rather, the Explanatory Notes\n\nindicate that, in addition to being principally used for amusement, a wheeled toy properly\n\nclassifiable under HTSUS Heading 9503 is also characterized by other common features.\n\n        For example, the exemplars listed in the Explanatory Notes, such as children’s tricycles,\n\npedal cars, and wheeled cars designed to be drawn or pushed, and large enough for children to\n\nride, are all items that require no training prior to their use and involve no meaningful risk of\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 11\n\n\ninjury. Rather, these items can be safely used by a child, with minimal supervision, and without\n\nprior instruction.\n\n        In addition, items, such as pedal cars and wheeled toys designed to be drawn or pushed\n\nwith a child riding inside, involve no development or practice of individual skills in order for\n\nthem to be used to their maximum capacity. Nor do these items afford a user a reasonable\n\ndegree of exercise or physical activity. That is, there is no minimum degree of skill required in\n\norder to fully use a wheeled toy, and wheeled toys do not provide notable exercise or require\n\nathletic ability.\n\n        Further, as noted, all articles listed as wheeled toys are propelled “by means of pedals,\n\nhand levers or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or rod, .\n\n. . by direct pressure of a person’s foot against the ground,” or by “simply [being] drawn or\n\npushed by another person or driven by a motor.” Explanatory Notes 95.03. Thus, wheeled toys\n\nall conform to a general design, characterized by the support of an assistive device, such as one\n\nor more seats, additional wheels, hand levers, handle bars, pedals, or breaks.\n\n        Accordingly, in addition to being an item with wheels that is used principally for\n\namusement, a wheeled toy under Heading 9503 is also characterized by the following features:\n\n(1) the absence of a training requirement prior to its use; (2) the absence of a meaningful risk of\n\ninjury involved in its use; (3) the lack of acquired skill to fully utilize the item; (4) the lack of\n\nexercise or athletic aspect in the item’s use; and (5) the presence of an assistive device.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 12\n\n\n   B. Heading 9503 Does Not Cover the Waveboards\n\n           1. Need for Training\n\n       Both parties agree that riding the waveboard requires the coordination of a user’s balance,\n\nsteering, and propulsion in unison. Def.’s Statement ¶ 24. As a result, the waveboards are\n\npackaged with a tutorial video that demonstrates how to safely ride the merchandise, and similar\n\ninstructional material is also available on Streetsurfing’s website. See Ex. A, Instructional DVD\n\nfor the Sample of The Wave (“Instructional DVD”); Ex. G, at 23, Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s First\n\nInterrogatories and Request for Production of Documents and Things. In addition, Streetsurfing\n\nemployed professional instructors to “visit[] thousands of schools and t[each] millions of\n\nstudents how to ride” its waveboards. Def.’s Statement ¶ 29 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThus, it is apparent that, unlike wheeled toys, riding waveboards require more than merely\n\nstepping onto the device and setting off. That the waveboards require a certain level of training\n\nprior to their use separates them from wheeled toys.\n\n       Thus, the presence of this additional feature in the use of the waveboards, the requirement\n\nof training prior to use, weighs against classifying the merchandise under Heading 9503 as\n\nwheeled toys.\n\n\n\n           2. Meaningful Risk of Injury\n\n       Another distinctive characteristic of a wheeled toy under HTSUS Heading 9503 is that\n\nthe item’s use does not involve any meaningful risk of injury. Here, as evidenced by the\n\nproduct’s labeling and other record evidence, a waveboard’s use carries a meaningful risk of\n\ninjury that is lacking with the wheeled toy exemplars of HTSUS Heading 9503. According to\n\nplaintiff, its waveboards are prohibited in over ninety percent of the skate parks in the United\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 13\n\n\nStates “because they are dangerous in the parks.” Pl.’s Statement ¶ 8 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Moreover, The Wave itself and the box in which it is packaged and sold state that the\n\nmerchandise contains a safety manual that should be read prior to its use, that protective gear\n\nshould be worn at all times, and that adult supervision is required. See Ex. A, Sample of The\n\nWave (“WARNING[:] . . . Children require competent adult supervision.”); Ex. A, Box of the\n\nSample of The Wave (“READ AND UNDERSTAND THE ENCLOSED SAFETY MANUAL\n\nBEFORE RIDING. ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY EQUIPMENT SUCH AS A HELMET, KNEE\n\nPADS, AND ELBOW PADS WHILE RIDING. . . . COMPETENT ADULT SUPERVISION\n\nRECOMMENDED.”).\n\n        Hence, unlike the wheeled toy items listed by the Explanatory Notes as classifiable under\n\nHTSUS Heading 9503, the waveboards do involve a meaningful risk of injury to users, therefore\n\nfurther indicating that the merchandise falls outside the realm of what constitutes a wheeled toy.\n\n\n\n            3. Skill\n\n        In addition to possessing wheels and being principally used for amusement, the wheeled\n\ntoy examples found in the Explanatory Notes require no acquisition of skill by their riders in\n\norder to get the maximum use from the toys. It is clear to the court that the waveboards do not\n\nshare this quality, and to the contrary, require that a user acquire a certain level of skill to fully\n\nuse the merchandise. Therefore, as with a skateboard, users need considerable skill and\n\nexperience in order to develop their technique and master the use of the waveboards in order to\n\nbe able to perform “tricks” or “stunts.” See Ex. A, Instructional DVD; Def.’s Statement ¶ 30.\n\n        Thus, record evidence demonstrates that the waveboards fail to meet this additional\n\nindicator of wheeled toy status: that users need not develop a degree of skill to use, and take full\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 14\n\n\nadvantage of, the waveboards, further showing that classification of the merchandise under\n\nHTSUS Heading 9503 as wheeled toys is improper.\n\n\n\n           4. Exercise\n\n       As to exercise, the exemplars in the Explanatory Note to HTSUS Heading 9503, such as\n\npedal cars, children’s motor cars, wheeled toys propelled by hand levers, or wheeled toys\n\ndesigned to be drawn or pushed, and large enough for children to ride, do not provide their user\n\nwith a workout. The waveboards’ users, on the other hand, get “good exercise,” working their\n\n“lower muscles, . . . the stomach and [their] legs.” Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 20, 21, 22 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Indeed, plaintiff introduced its waveboards to thousands of schools as\n\npart of the schools’ physical education programs, because the waveboards are “a physical\n\nactivity” teaching students “a new skill that works on core stability utilizing balance, weight\n\ntransfer[,] and movement through space.” Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 28, 29.\n\n       Because the waveboards afford users a reasonable degree of exercise or physical activity,\n\nclassification as a wheeled toy under HTSUS Heading 9503 is not appropriate.\n\n\n\n           5. Design\n\n       Another feature that characterizes wheeled toys is their common design. Specifically,\n\nthose items classified under Heading 9503 by the Explanatory Notes all include the presence of\n\nan assistive device. That the waveboards fail to conform to this common design feature further\n\nsupports defendant’s claim that plaintiff’s waveboards cannot be classified as wheeled toys under\n\nHeading 9503.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                            Page 15\n\n\n       As previously discussed, the Explanatory Notes describe wheeled toys under HTSUS\n\nHeading 9503 as\n\n       articles . . . usually designed for propulsion either by means of pedals, hand levers\n       or other simple devices which transmit power to the wheels through a chain or\n       rod, or, as in the case of certain scooters, by direct pressure of a person’s foot\n       against the ground. Other types of wheeled toys may be simply drawn or pushed\n       by another person or driven by a motor.\n\nExplanatory Notes 95.03. According to plaintiff, after pushing off with his or her foot, “[t]he\n\nrider on the subject waveboard propels himself by mak[ing] a twisting motion to the left with\n\nrespect to the front board, and biases the board to the left, while the rear board biases to the right,\n\nin order to keep the rider steady. The rider moves forward simply by twisting and releasing the\n\nboards.” Pl.’s Statement ¶ 6. Unlike wheeled toys, waveboards do not possess pedals, hand\n\nlevers, or any other device that transmits power to the wheels. Rather, the waveboards are\n\npropelled forward by the riders shifting their weight from side to side while maintaining their\n\nbalance without the support of an assistive device, such as one or more seats, additional wheels,\n\nhand levers, handle bars, pedals, or brakes, which is present in the exemplars identified by the\n\nExplanatory Notes.\n\n       Accordingly, it weighs further against their classification as wheeled toys that plaintiff’s\n\nwaveboards fail to conform to the design methods presented by the examples found in the\n\nExplanatory Note to Heading 9503.\n\n\n\n           6. Conclusion\n\n       Based on the foregoing, the court finds that the scope of HTSUS Heading 9503 is too\n\nnarrow to encompass the waveboards. Although items with wheels that can provide amusement,\n\nplaintiff’s waveboards fail to conform to the other necessary criteria needed for classification as\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                           Page 16\n\n\nwheeled toys under Heading 9503. That is, because plaintiff’s waveboards (1) require training\n\nprior to their use, (2) involve a meaningful risk of injury, (3) require that a user develop a degree\n\nof skill, (4) provide the user with considerable exercise, and (5) do not conform to the design of\n\nwheeled toys because they do not employ an assistive device for users, the waveboards lack the\n\nnecessary elements for classification as wheeled toys. Accordingly, the waveboards cannot be\n\nclassified as such under HTSUS Heading 9503.\n\n\n\nIV.      THE WAVEBOARDS ARE PROPERLY CLASSIFIABLE UNDER HEADING 9506 AS SPORTS\n         EQUIPMENT OR ARTICLES FOR GENERAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR ATHLETICS\n\n         Because HTSUS Heading 9503 is a principal use provision, it is more specific than\n\nHTSUS Heading 9506, which is a residual provision. See BASF Corp., 482 F.3d at 1326. Thus,\n\nwere the waveboards prima facie classifiable under Heading 9503 as wheeled toys, they would\n\nbe precluded from classification under Heading 9506 as sports equipment or articles for general\n\nphysical exercise or athletics. Because, as has been seen, the waveboards are not properly\n\nclassifiable under HTSUS Heading 9503, the court turns to defendant’s proposed classification.\n\n\n\n      A. Construction of Heading 9506\n\n         HTSUS Heading 9506 encompasses “Articles and equipment for general physical\n\nexercise, gymnastics, athletics, other sports (including table-tennis) or outdoor games, not\n\nspecified or included elsewhere in this chapter; swimming pools and wading pools; parts and\n\naccessories thereof.” The heading’s accompanying Explanatory Note identifies a number of\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 17\n\n\nitems covered by Heading 9506, including snow-skis, water-skis, ice skates, surfboards, roller\n\nskates, and skateboards. 8 Explanatory Notes 95.06.\n\n       This Court has held that an activity falls within the meaning of a “sport” when “[i]t\n\npossesses to a meaningful degree the . . . attributes of healthy, challenging[,] and skillful\n\n       8\n               The complete list of exemplars identified by the Explanatory Note to HTSUS\nHeading 9506 is as follows:\n      (B) Requisites for other sports and outdoor games (other than toys presented in\n      sets, or separately, of heading 95.03), e.g.:\n               (1) Snow-skis and other snow-ski equipment (e.g., ski-fastenings (ski-\n      bindings), ski brakes, ski poles).\n               (2) Water-skis, surf-boards, sailboards and other water-sport equipment,\n      such as diving stages (platforms), chutes, divers’ flippers and respiratory masks of\n      a kind used without oxygen or compressed air bottles, and simple underwater\n      breathing tubes (generally known as ‘snorkels’) for swimmers or divers.\n               (3) Golf clubs and other golf equipment, such as golf balls, golf tees.\n               (4) Articles and equipment for table-tennis (ping-pong), such as tables\n      (with or without legs), bats (paddles), balls and nets.\n               (5) Tennis, badminton or similar rackets (e.g., squash rackets), whether or\n      not strung.\n               (6) Balls, other than golf balls and table-tennis balls, such as tennis balls,\n      footballs, rugby balls and similar balls (including bladders and covers for such\n      balls); water polo, basketball and similar valve type balls; cricket balls.\n               (7) Ice skates and roller skates, including skating boots with skates\n      attached.\n               (8) Sticks and bats for hockey, cricket, lacrosse, etc.; chistera (jai alai\n      scoops); pucks for ice hockey; curling stones.\n               (9) Nets for various games (tennis, badminton, volleyball, football,\n      basketball, etc.).\n               (10) Fencing equipment: fencing foils, sabres and rapiers and their parts\n      (e.g., blades, guards, hilts and buttons or stops), etc.\n               (11) Archery equipment, such as bows, arrows and targets.\n               (12) Equipment of a kind used in children’s playgrounds (e.g., swings,\n      slides, see-saws and giant strides).\n               (13) Protective equipment for sports or games, e.g., fencing masks and\n      breast plates, elbow and knee pads, cricket pads, shin-guards, ice hockey pants\n      with built-in guards and pads.\n               (14) Other articles and equipment, such as requisites for deck tennis,\n      quoits or bowls; skate boards; racket presses; mallets for polo or croquet;\n      boomerangs; ice axes; clay pigeons and clay pigeon projectors; bobsleighs\n      (bobsleds), luges and similar non-motorised vehicles for sliding on snow or ice.\nExplanatory Notes 95.06 (emphasis added).\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 18\n\n\nrecreation.” Newman Importing Co. v.

Cir.\n\n2011) (alterations in original) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). The parties\n\nagree that the waveboards are the only piece of equipment necessary to engage in “streetsurfing.”\n\nSee Pl.’s Br. 17–18; Def.’s Br. 3.\n\n\n\n    B. The Presence of Organized Competition and Rules for an Activity Is Not Dispositive\n       as to Whether Articles Used to Participate in That Activity Are Classifiable Under\n       Heading 9506\n\n        Plaintiff contends that its waveboards are not sports equipment, and thus, not classifiable\n\nas such under Heading 9506, because waveboarding is not a sport. Pl.’s Br. 17. For plaintiff,\n\nbecause waveboarding is not recognized by the general public as a sport and does not possess\n\nspecific rules or involve competition, its merchandise cannot be covered by Heading 9506. See\n\nPl.’s Br. 22.\n\n        This Court’s previous holdings make clear that an activity qualifies as a “sport” when it\n\nprovides “skillful recreation.” Newman, 76 Cust. Ct. at 143, 415 F. Supp. at 376. In Newman,\n\nthe Court held that backpacking is a sport and rejected the “contention that a sport must involve\n\ncompetition either between individuals or against the natural elements.” Id. Rather than\n\ncompetitiveness, the Court explained that what is indicative of a sport is an activity involving\n\n“the element of enjoyment or recreation arising from the development or practice of individual\n\nskills.” Id. at 144, 415 F. Supp. at 376.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                               Page 19\n\n\n       By way of contrast, in Camel Manufacturing Co. v. United States, this Court found that\n\n“camping out” is not a sport. Camel Mfg. Co. v. United States, 12 CIT 426, 427–28, 686 F.\n\nSupp. 912, 913 (1988). In doing so, the Court narrowed the holding in Newman, cautioning that\n\nnot every activity that contains “a certain degree of challenge and skill . . . [can] be considered a\n\nsport.” Id. at 427, 686 F. Supp. at 913. The Court explained, however, that the purpose of the\n\nholding in Newman was to “prevent[] a superficial standard of interpersonal competition from\n\nbecoming the identifying essence of sports.” Id. at 428, 686 F. Supp. at 914.\n\n       Plaintiff’s position that its waveboards do not qualify as sporting goods because\n\n“waveboarding” does not possess set rules or regular competition is without merit. This Court’s\n\nholdings in Newman and Camel Manufacturing sensibly found that competition or a set of\n\norganized rules are not essential to the determination of whether an activity is a sport.\n\n       Indeed, the exemplars identified in the Explanatory Note to HTSUS Heading 9506\n\nsupport this conclusion. The presence of listed items, such as children’s playground equipment\n\n(e.g., swings, slides, and seesaws), equipment for snorkeling and diving, and ice axes, indicate\n\nthat the drafters did not intend to limit the heading’s scope to activities that incorporate a\n\ncompetitive structure, a formal league, or rules. Further, despite the presence of competition in\n\nthe use of roller skates (e.g., roller derbies) or skateboards, for example, roller skates and\n\nskateboards are not primarily used in organized competition, nor is the common use of these\n\nitems characterized by sets of rules.\n\n       It is clear, then, that the scope of Heading 9506 encompasses more than plaintiff claims,\n\nand includes merchandise used for general physical exercise and athletics, in addition to articles\n\nused for organized and competitive sports. Thus, whether “waveboarding” possesses formal\n\nrules or involves organized competition is not only not dispositive to the question of whether the\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 20\n\n\nactivity is a sport, but it also is not relevant to the classification of plaintiff’s merchandise under\n\nHeading 9506, which also covers articles for general physical exercise or athletics.\n\n        Thus, it is evident that whether “waveboarding” is a sport with formal rules or\n\ncompetition is not determinative of whether plaintiff’s waveboards qualify for coverage under\n\nHeading 9506.\n\n\n\n    C. The Waveboards Possess the Necessary Features to Qualify for Coverage Under\n       HTSUS Heading 9506\n\n        As noted, the Explanatory Notes are regularly used by this Court to determine the intent\n\nof the drafters with respect to the provisions of the HTSUS. See Mita, 21 F.3d at 1082. In this\n\ninstance, the Explanatory Note accompanying Heading 9506 provides the court with additional\n\ninsight as to those items with wheels that are intended to be classified under Heading 9506 as\n\nsporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or athletics. Because the waveboards\n\nconform to the features that characterize items covered by HTSUS Heading 9506, the heading\n\nencompasses plaintiff’s merchandise.\n\n\n\n            1. Training\n\n        After reviewing the exemplars listed under HTSUS Heading 9506, it is clear that a\n\ncommon element among those items with wheels listed as sports equipment or articles for\n\ngeneral physical exercise or athletics (e.g., skateboards and roller skates) is that the items’ users\n\nrequire a certain degree of training prior to their use. Moreover, generally, the non-wheeled\n\narticles listed under the Explanatory Note for Heading 9506, such as snow- and water-ski\n\nequipment, golf clubs, equipment for racket sports, ice skates, and archery and fencing\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                             Page 21\n\n\nequipment, all require prior training. 9 A child or adult user would be unable to employ any one\n\nof these items with meaningful precision or effectiveness without prior instruction.\n\n        As has been set out earlier in this opinion, prior training is required in order to ride\n\nwaveboards. Users require prior training and practice to be able to enjoy using the waveboards\n\nin any meaningful capacity, which requires that riders be able to balance themselves on the\n\nboard, propel the board forward, and steer the board all at once. See Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 23, 24.\n\nThis training requirement indicates that the waveboards qualify as sporting goods or articles for\n\ngeneral physical exercise or athletics under HTSUS Heading 9506.\n\n\n\n            2. Skill\n\n        A review of the accompanying Explanatory Note for HTSUS Heading 9506 also makes\n\nclear that those items classified under HTSUS 9506 (e.g., water-skis, surfboards, skateboards, ice\n\nskates, tennis rackets, ice hockey equipment, and archery equipment) require that one develop a\n\ndegree of skill in order to take full advantage of the products. Indeed, this observation is\n\nsupported by this Court’s prior holding in Newman. See Newman, 76 Cust. Ct. at 144, 415 F.\n\nSupp. at 376 (“In any event the element of enjoyment or recreation arising from the development\n\nor practice of individual skills, different from those involved in routine daily activities, is a better\n\nindication of a sport than competitiveness.” (emphasis added)).\n\n        As previously discussed, record evidence shows that users must acquire a degree of skill\n\nin order to be proficient in riding the waveboards and take full advantage of the merchandise.\n\nWhile a rider, with prior training, may be able to use the waveboards in a limited fashion, it is\n\n\n\n\n        9\n             The notable exception to this finding is playground equipment, items far removed\nfrom waveboards.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 22\n\n\nwith further practice and the acquisition of a greater degree of skill that users will be able to\n\nexpand on the product’s uses. As demonstrated by Streetsurfing’s sales literature and\n\ninstructional DVD packaged with the merchandise, users with greater skill are able to ride the\n\nwaveboards with greater speed and a higher degree of precision, on more uncertain terrain (e.g.,\n\nhills and sidewalks), and may even become proficient enough to perform “tricks” and “stunts”\n\nsimilar to those performed using a skateboard. See Ex. A, Instructional DVD; Def.’s Statement ¶\n\n30. Skill is required for a rider to take full advantage of the articles covered by HTSUS Heading\n\n9506, and the presence of this element further favors classification of plaintiff’s waveboards\n\nunder this heading, as sporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or athletics.\n\n\n\n           3. Exercise\n\n       Another common feature exhibited by the exemplars listed by the Explanatory Note for\n\nHTSUS Heading 9506 is that the activities for which the listed items are used afford a user a\n\nreasonable degree of exercise or physical activity. As noted, record evidence shows that using\n\nthe waveboards provides users with a workout, giving them “good exercise,” working their\n\n“lower muscles, . . . the stomach and [their] legs.” Def.’s Statement ¶¶ 20, 21, 22 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). The listed exemplars all provide users with meaningful exercise and a\n\nreasonable degree of physical activity, whether it be equipment used for skiing, racket sports,\n\nfencing, water sports and activities, or even children’s playground equipment.\n\n       Therefore, because plaintiff’s waveboards conform to the additional features that\n\ncharacterize those items that, according to the Explanatory Notes, are properly classified as\n\nsporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or athletics, the classification of the\n\nwaveboards under HTSUS Heading 9506 is favored.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                          Page 23\n\n\n   D. The Court’s Examination of the Merchandise\n\n       As this Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have confirmed, “the\n\nmerchandise itself is often a potent witness in classification cases.” Simod Am.

Having examined the sample of\n\nThe Wave supplied by the parties and its accompanying instructional DVD, in the court’s view,\n\nplaintiff’s waveboards are akin to skateboards. See Appendix infra. Although there are certain\n\nminor distinguishable characteristics between the items, plaintiff’s waveboards are undeniably\n\nalmost visually identical, as well as duplicative in their components, physical characteristics, and\n\nuse as skateboards. As noted, a skateboard is listed by the Explanatory Notes as an example of\n\nan item that is properly classified as sports equipment or an article for general physical exercise\n\nor athletics under HTSUS Heading 9506.\n\n\n\n   E. Customs Properly Classified the Merchandise Under HTSUS Heading 9506\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Customs properly classified the waveboards under HTSUS\n\n9506.99.60. Despite plaintiff’s arguments to the contrary, this Court has held that the presence\n\nof organized competition and specific rules is not determinative of whether an activity qualifies\n\nas a sport, nor is it determinative of whether the article qualifies for coverage under Heading\n\n9506. That is, the argument that “waveboarding” does not involve competition or possess rules\n\ndoes not aid plaintiff’s case because Heading 9506 is much broader than plaintiff claims and\n\ncovers items in addition to those used for organized sports.\n\fCourt No. 09-00136                                                                              Page 24\n\n\n         Further, the Explanatory Notes to the two competing tariff provisions indicate that there\n\nare additional criteria that distinguish wheeled items under Heading 9506 from wheeled toys\n\nunder Heading 9503. The use of items qualifying as sports equipment or articles for general\n\nphysical exercise or athletics requires a degree of training and a certain level of skill and\n\nathleticism, which are features absent from the use of wheeled toys, but which characterize\n\nplaintiff’s waveboards. Additionally, the use of the wheeled toy items does not involve any\n\nmeaningful risk of injury, an element that is clearly present in the use of the waveboards, nor do\n\nwheeled toys provide exercise. Moreover, wheeled toys all share a common design, in that they\n\neach possess an assistive device for the user, which is lacking in the waveboards and the\n\nexemplars listed for Heading 9506. Finally, the court’s own examination of the merchandise\n\nonly reaffirms its conclusion that there can be no doubt that the waveboards resemble\n\nskateboards.\n\n         Accordingly, the court finds that Customs properly classified the waveboards under\n\nHTSUS 9506.99.60 because they are sporting goods or articles for general physical exercise or\n\nathletics. See Jarvis Clark, 733 F.2d at 878.\n\n\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n         Based on the foregoing, the court concludes that the correct tariff classification for the\n\nRipple Board and The Wave is subheading 9506.99.60, HTSUS, subject to a duty rate of 4% ad\n\nvalorem.
