Sec. 2000e et seq;  42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981.  For the following reasons, this Court affirms the judgment of the district court in part, but vacates the district court's judgment regarding the applicant class claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust (\"the Bank\") hired Watson in August of 1973 as a proof operator.  The Bank promoted Watson to the position of teller trainee approximately two years later.  After a two to three month training period, Watson became a teller in the Bank's motor bank in January of 1976.  Subsequently, the Bank transferred Watson to the Bank's main lobby and later promoted Watson to the position of commercial teller on February 2, 1980.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of the next year, Watson unsuccessfully applied for four different promotions.  First, in February of 1980, Watson unsuccessfully applied for promotion to the position of supervisor of tellers, which became vacant due to the resignation of assistant cashier Brian England.  Watson;  Richard Burt, a white male who was then the supervisor of the bookkeeping department;  Gail Levitt, a white female who was then supervisor of motor bank tellers;  and Pat Cullar, a white female who was then a commercial teller, all applied for the position.  Gary Shipp, senior vice president and cashier at the Bank since 1977 and the person to whom the supervisor of tellers reported, selected Richard Burt as England's replacement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   Second, Watson unsuccessfully applied for promotion to the position of motor bank teller supervisor.  Watson, Pat Cullar, and four or five other persons applied for the position vacated by Gail Levitt.  Pat Cullar received the promotion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Third, Watson unsuccessfully applied a second time for the position of lobby teller supervisor when the Bank again promoted Burt.  Watson, Cullar, Sylvia Hardin, a black female commercial teller, and Patsy Weatherly, a white female who was then supervisor of the proof department, all applied for the position.  Burt chose Cullar.  Fourth, as a result of Cullar's second promotion, the position of motor bank teller supervisor again became vacant, and Watson unsuccessfully applied for the position.  Other applicants included Hardin and Kevin Brown, a white male teller in the motor bank.  Based on Cullar's recommendation, Burt selected Brown for the position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson took a leave of absence from work in January 1981 in order to undergo foot surgery.  She applied for the last two described promotions while on sick leave.  Watson did not return to work after January of 1981, and she subsequently resigned in August of 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Watson timely filed the instant suit on October 21, 1981, alleging that the Bank discriminated against her and other similarly situated persons on the basis of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e et seq.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing on the class certification issue, the district court certified a class consisting of \"blacks who applied to or were employed by defendant on or after October 21, 1979 or who may submit employment applications to defendant in the future.\"    Subsequently, the district court decertified the broad class of employees and applicants because the district court concluded, in light of all the evidence at trial, that there was not \"a common question of law or fact between the unsuccessful black applicants and those blacks employed by the Bank.\"    The district court then split the class into two distinct classes consisting of (1) black applicants and (2) black employees.  The district court further found that the class of black employees did not meet the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) and decertified the employee class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, the district court concluded first that although Watson demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, she failed to demonstrate that the Bank's articulated reasons for failing to promote her were pretextual.  The district court then addressed the claims of the applicant class holding that Watson's statistical evidence failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination in hiring because the percentage of blacks in the Bank's work force mirrored the percentage of blacks in Tarrant County, Texas, and the Fort Worth metropolitan area, citing Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Watson challenges the district court's decertification of the broad class composed of both applicants and employees and further challenges the district court's resolution of both her individual claim and the claims of the applicant class.  For the following reasons, this Court affirms the judgment of the district court in part, but vacates the district court's judgment regarding the applicant class claims, remanding solely for the district court to dismiss the applicant class claims without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. CLASS CERTIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's class certification order is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.   Jenkins v. Raymark Industries, Inc., 782 F.2d 468, 472 (5th Cir.1986).  Even after initial certification, a district court may determine that certification was improvidently granted, and a district court remains free to decertify, subclassify or modify the class certification previously entered.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1);  General Telephone Company of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 2372, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Falcon, this Court permitted a plaintiff alleging race discrimination to assert an \" 'across the board' attack on all unequal employment practices alleged to have been committed by the employer pursuant to a policy of racial discrimination.\"    457 U.S. at 152;  102 S.Ct. at 2367.   See, e.g., Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 417 F.2d 1122, 1124 (5th Cir.1969).  In Falcon, the Supreme Court curtailed that practice holding that it was error for the district court in that case to certify a class of both applicants and employees because the district court erroneously presumed, without a specific presentation, that the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 were met.  \"[W]e reiterate today that a Title VII class action, like any other class action, may only be certified if the trial court is satisfied, after a rigorous analysis, that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have been satisfied.\"    457 U.S. at 161, 102 S.Ct. at 2372.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Falcon, however, does not foreclose all classes composed of applicants and employees.  457 U.S. at 159 n. 15;  102 S.Ct. at 2371 n. 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>   See, e.g., Vuyanich v. Republic National Bank, 723 F.2d 1195, 1199-1200, rehearing denied, 736 F.2d 160 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 567, 83 L.Ed.2d 507 (1984);  Richardson v. Byrd, 709 F.2d 1016, 1019-20 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1009, 104 S.Ct. 527, 78 L.Ed.2d 270 (1983).  The \"entirely subjective decisionmaking process\" articulated in Footnote 15 presents one factual situation in which a putative class might meet the requirements of Rule 23(a).  Chief Justice Berger, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, suggests another:  Rule 23(a) might be met upon a showing that \"the same person or persons who made the challenged decisions were motivated by prejudice against [the protected class], and that this prejudice manifested itself in both the hiring decisions and the decisions not to promote [members of the class].\"  457 U.S. at 162 &amp; n., 102 S.Ct. at 2373 &amp; n.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the district court relied on the Chief Justice's opinion to certify a class composed of both applicants and employees.  After the evidentiary hearing, the district court found that a single individual, Gary Shipp, was responsible for both hiring and promotion decisions.  That fact, the district court reasoned, satisfied the commonality requirement for a class composed of both applicants and employees.  After the trial on the merits, however, the district court concluded that Shipp's role was more limited.  The evidence at trial demonstrated that a limited group of white department supervisors made all hiring and promotion decisions, as well as employee evaluations used to compute compensation, and that upper management routinely approved those decisions.  As a result, the district court concluded that Watson failed to show the existence of common questions between the applicants' and employees' claims because the same individual was not responsible for both hiring and promotion decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson asserts the district court erred because the commonality requirement may be satisfied by a showing that the same persons make both types of decisions.  Assuming, arguendo, that Watson is correct, this Court's inquiry does not end with that conclusion.  We cannot conclude that certification of a class of both employees and applicants is mandated merely because common questions exist.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   Rather, the other factors enunciated in Rule 23(a) also must be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, assuming a common question was presented in the instant case, e.g., whether the same limited group of white supervisors discriminated in both hiring and promotions, that common question was not in fact a central feature in the actual proof presented at trial.  The applicant class claims relied primarily on applicant flow statistics.  In contrast, the proof asserted in support of the promotions claims focused on statistical evidence of the Bank's treatment of black individuals in the employee evaluation process, promotions process, compensation process and other employment practices.  Consequently, the actual proof presented demonstrates that Watson's promotion claim was not typical of the applicant class claims, and she was not an adequate class representative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court concludes that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to decertify the class because, as a practical matter, the \"maintenance of [Watson's] action as a class action did not advance 'the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of the procedure.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159, 102 S.Ct. at 2371 (quoting American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 553, 94 S.Ct. 756, 766, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974)).  As the actual proof at trial demonstrated, the hiring and promotion claims might well have been tried separately, id., and it was not an abuse of discretion to so proceed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>IV. WATSON'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM OF DISCRIMINATION</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court analyzed Watson's individual claim of discrimination under the test enunciated in Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), and McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).  Under this test, the district court ultimately concluded that Watson was not the victim of racial discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, Watson asserts that the district court erred in not applying disparate impact analysis to her claims of discrimination in promotion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>   Contrary to Watson's position on appeal, this Court's recent precedent establishes that a Title VII challenge to an allegedly discretionary promotion system is properly analyzed under the disparate treatment model rather than the disparate impact model.   See, e.g., Lewis v. NLRB, 750 F.2d 1266, 1271 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1985);  Carroll v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, 708 F.2d 183, 188 (5th Cir.1983);  Carpenter v. Stephen F. Austin State University, 706 F.2d 608, 620 (5th Cir.1983);  Pouncy v. Prudential Insurance Co., 668 F.2d 795, 800 (5th Cir.1982).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>   Having decided to decertify the class, the district court then properly treated Watson's claim as an individual disparate treatment claim, and the court correctly analyzed this claim under the Green model.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Watson and the dissent urge that we analyze this case under a different model.  Given our approval of the district court's decision to decertify the class, however, this suggestion is unavailing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say, however, that the plethora of statistics which Watson introduced at trial, and upon which the dissent so heavily relies, are irrelevant in an individual disparate treatment case.  Not only may the statistics be relevant at the initial stage of the litigation in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> but they are also relevant at the third stage of analysis when the plaintiff is attempting to prove that the reasons proffered by the defendant for its action are either unworthy of credence or mere pretexts for discrimination.   See, e.g., Green, 411 U.S. at 804-05, 93 S.Ct. at 1825.  In this case, the district court did not decide to decertify the class until after the trial had been completed and all the statistical evidence had been introduced.  Much of the evidence, of course, was related primarily to the plaintiff's class claims.  Even once the class claims dropped from the suit, however, the data retained relevance to the plaintiff's individual claim since it continued to bear on the veracity of the defendant's explanations for its promotion decisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing all the evidence, including the statistical evidence, the district court concluded that the reasons offered by the Bank were not pretextual.  We judge this holding under the clearly erroneous standard.   Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).  We conclude that the district court's finding that the Bank's explanations for its action were not pretexts for discrimination is not clearly erroneous.  The district court's finding will not be set aside unless this Court on the entire evidence is left with the \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed.2d 746 (1948).  \"Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\"   Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 1512, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson challenges the district court's ultimate finding of no discrimination on three specific grounds:  (1) that the district court erroneously relied on the Bank's subjectively administered performance evaluations, which Watson asserts were proven to be racially biased, (2) that the district court erroneously relied on a reason not articulated by the Bank for its failure to promote her, and (3) that the district court erroneously considered a series of articulated qualifications for promotion which were inconsistent, contradictory, and therefore incredible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court specifically credited the Bank's assertion that it promoted Burt and Cullar rather than Watson because in all three instances Watson had less experience or supervisory experience than the individual chosen for promotion.  Although the district court noted that Burt received excellent performance evaluations and that Cullar's and Watson's ratings were comparable, the district court clearly placed primary emphasis on Burt's and Cullar's experience in finding no discrimination and little emphasis on the employee evaluations.  This Court cannot say that the district court's ultimate finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court is more troubled by the Bank's promotion of Brown because Brown clearly had less experience than Watson.  The district court noted that Cullar highly recommended Brown for the promotion, relying on his performance as a teller and as her assistant.  In addition, the Bank relied on Brown's experience supervising temporary employees at Six Flags Over Texas.  Finally, the district court noted that Watson was on sick leave when the position became vacant and Brown, in contrast, was available immediately.  The Bank, however, failed to urge this last reason as a basis for its failure to promote Watson.  Disregarding this basis for upholding the district court's decision, the record nevertheless still supports \"two permissible views of the evidence.\"    Specifically, even though the reasons articulated for Brown's promotion are somewhat inconsistent with the Bank's articulated reasons for Burt's and Cullar's promotions, the district court clearly credited the Bank's explanation.  We do not find any inconsistency to be so striking as to make the Bank's proffered reasons incredible.  Consequently, this Court holds that the finding regarding the Brown promotion is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE APPLICANT CLASS CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding that Watson was not an adequate representative of the applicant class because her promotion claims were not typical of the applicant claims, the district court nevertheless chose to address the merits of the applicant claims.  The district court found that Watson failed to present a prima facie case of race discrimination in hiring because the percentage of blacks in the Bank's work force mirrored the percentage of blacks in the population of Tarrant County and the Fort Worth metropolitan area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than address the correctness of the district court's reliance on population figures rather than applicant flow data, and we note parenthetically our grave concerns with the district court's approach, see Payne, 673 F.2d at 823-24, this Court vacates the judgment of the district court as it relates to the applicant class claims.  The case is remanded to the district court to dismiss the applicant claims without prejudice.  We note the unfair prejudice that might flow from a determination of the class claims when both the district court and this Court have held that the named plaintiff is not a proper class representative.   Vuyanich, 723 F.2d at 1200;  Wheeler v. City of Columbus, 703 F.2d 853, 855 (5th Cir.1983).   See also Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113, 125 (3d Cir.1986).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court finds no abuse of discretion in the district court's class decertification decision.  In addition, this Court affirms the district court's conclusion that Watson was not the victim of racial discrimination.  Finally, this Court vacates the district court's judgment as it relates to the applicant class claims and remands the case to the district court to dismiss those applicant class claims without prejudice.  The judgment of the district court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IRVING L.

The erosion began with Vuyanich v. Republic National Bank,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> and it grows today with the majority's refusal to certify a class of applicants and employees in the face of common and typical questions of fact and law and unrebutted statistical proof of a class-wide pattern and practice of discrimination.  Nothing in Rule 23 or this circuit's interpretation of the rule compels this result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The class action has been the greatest instrument in enforcing Title VII's promise that invidious race discrimination shall have no role in the workplace.  Without the efficiency and economy of this procedural tool, it is safe to say that the injuries of thousands would have remained both undiscovered and unredressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>   And yet, in the name of the very efficiency and economy that give the class action its being, the majority disposes of only one individual's claim and forecloses forever proof of a pattern and practice of discrimination by appellee Ft. Worth Bank &amp; Trust (the bank).  The applicants must start over from square one,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> and the employees have no choice but to shoulder a far more onerous evidentiary burden and prosecute their claims one by one by one.  This result serves neither efficiency nor economy.  More significantly, it disserves Title VII by preventing the court from recognizing and eradicating what is, on the record before us, clearly a pattern and practice of discrimination.  The majority has left the substantive norms of Title VII twisting in the cold wind of the Fifth Circuit's Rule 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's opinion has at least two readily apparent consequences.  First, the opinion would compel a finding that the district court's initial decision to certify the class was an abuse of discretion.  This result is apparent because the nature of plaintiff's statistical proof--which the majority deems fatal to typicality--is the same whether one individual or a group of individuals makes the decisions affecting the class.  Thus, even if every single decision had been made exclusively by Shipp instead of the white supervisors, this circuit would now refuse to certify the class because the class representative, in the absence of a smoking gun, was forced to rely on separate sets of statistics to prove up intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more important, the majority consigns pattern and practice suits to the dustbin of this circuit's history.  Whether from inadvertance or fear of overflowing dockets, this circuit is erecting insurmountable obstacles to the full enforcement of Title VII.  This dam threatens to stop the flow of statutory rights and holds the promise of an arid and barren future.  The rights, duties, and liabilities that arise from the constitution and statutes flow freely and are not to be impeded by the fear that there will be a flood of cases.  We have heard this hue and cry since the days of the constitution's nativity, and it has never stopped our judicial instrumentalities from carrying out their duties.  It threatens to do so today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the matter directly at hand, this appeal raises two significant issues.  The first is whether the district court abused its discretion in bifurcating the class.  I believe that it did and would accordingly recertify the class.  The second issue, which the majority does not reach, is whether the plaintiff successfully established a prima facie case of class-wide disparate treatment.  I would answer this question in the affirmative as well, and hold in addition that the bank failed to rebut appellant's case.  Accordingly, I would reverse and remand for appropriate relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Class Certification</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"racial discrimination is by definition class discrimination,\" General Telephone Company of the Southwest v.

Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 417 F.2d 1122, 1124 (5th Cir.1969), generally permitted \"across-the-board\" attacks on racially discriminatory employment practices merely upon the showing that the plaintiffs and the class they sought to represent were of the same race.  See generally Note, Certifying Classes and Subclasses in Title VII Suits, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 619, 621 (1986).  In Falcon, however, this approach ran aground on the shoals of commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a>   As the Supreme Court reasoned,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>Conceptually, there is a wide gap between (a) an individual's claim that he has been denied a promotion on discriminatory grounds, and his otherwise unsupported allegation that the company has a policy of discrimination, and (b) the existence of a class of persons who have suffered the same injury as that individual, such that the individual's claim and the class claims will share common questions of law or fact and that the individual's claim will be typical of the class claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 2370.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Falcon, a Mexican-American who had been denied a promotion sought, as in this case, to represent unsuccessful applicants as well in a broad attack on the defendant's employment practices.  The district court certified the across-the-board class.  The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, holding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>Without any specific presentation identifying the questions of law or fact that were common to the claims of [the class representative] and of the members of the class he sought to represent, it was error for the District Court to presume that respondent's claim was typical of other claims against petitioner by Mexican-American employees and applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 2371.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, did not foreclose completely the possibility that future plaintiffs might succeed in representing an across-the-board class that did not run afoul of Rule 23's prerequisites.  In particular, the Court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>Significant proof that an employer operated under a general policy of discrimination conceivably could justify a class of both applicants and employees if the discrimination manifested itself in hiring and promotion practices in the same general fashion, such as through entirely subjective decisionmaking processes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 2371 n. 15.  While footnote 15 of Falcon carves out an exception to what could be considered a general ban against certifying a class of both employees and applicants, it more accurately does no more than simply describe one way in which a putative class representative may satisfy Rule 23's requirement that she demonstrate claims and questions of law or fact typical and common to the class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a>   Footnote 15 does not purport to describe the whole universe of common questions of law and fact that are sufficient to unite applicants and employees in a common class.

Byrd, 709 F.2d 1016 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1009, 104 S.Ct. 527, 78 L.Ed.2d 710 (1983), the district court had certified a class consisting of both applicants and employees in a sex discrimination case against a Sheriff's employment practices.  In holding that the district court had not erred in certifying the class, this court first noted that Falcon had not held \"that employees never can represent applicants or that an across-the-board class is never appropriate.\" Id. at 1020.  The court then found a \"sufficient Rule 23(a) nexus\" in the defendant Sheriff's practice of restricting the assignment of all new female deputies to the jail, a practice which, because the number of positions offered females was smaller than that offered males, necessarily limited the number of females that could then be transferred to more desirable positions in the Sheriff's office.  The court found \"this connection between employees assigned to the jail and job applicants ... plainly sufficient to support a class of both.\"   Id. at 1020.  The court then found that the named plaintiff was a proper class representative because \"her claim involved issues of law or fact common to those of applicants and employees assigned to the jail.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court based this finding on plaintiff's showing that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheriff's employment practices were infected by the \"entirely subjective decision-making processes\" recognized in Falcon as a manifestation of policy whose impact might be sufficient to connect otherwise differently situated persons.  The district court found that \"[t]he Sheriff's Office had no established seniority or merit system to determine eligibility for transfer o[r] promotion.  Nor did it have written guidelines for promotion or transfers.  Instead, promotions and transfers were determined by the supervisors, almost all of whom were male, based largely on subjective factors.\"    This finding demonstrates that \"discrimination in its broadest sense\" was not the only claim common to Richardson and the class she sought to represent.  Compare Wheeler v. City of Columbus, 703 F.2d 853 (5th Cir.1983).  The concerns of Falcon were met when the proof surfaced an accused employment practice that adversely affected her and the certified class of employees and applicants.   See Carpenter v. Stephen F. Austin State University, 706 F.2d 608 (5th Cir.1983) (custodial workers held to be proper class representatives of clerical workers since both were affected by subjective job assignment procedure).  The district court did not err in certifying this class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with Watson's claim to represent a class of applicants and employees at Ft. Worth Bank &amp; Trust, and mindful of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Falcon, the district court properly held a full day's evidentiary hearing on plaintiff's request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court made the following findings as to the common decision-making process affecting applicants and employees:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hiring decisions at the Bank are made by the department supervisors, who then submit their decisions to Gary Shipp for formal approval.  Shipp rarely vetoes hiring decisions made by those supervisors reporting to him.  Shipp personally interviews some applicants but makes the final hiring decisions only for those persons working directly under his supervision.  During all periods relevant to this suit, Shipp had final authority over all personnel matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Performance evaluations and promotion decisions are made by the supervisors for those employees under their authority.  Since 1978 employees have been given yearly written evaluations which are completed by their supervisors.  Salary increases are calculated on the basis of the performance ratings.  The supervisors present the evaluations to the Salary Review Committee, which consists of the president or executive vice president of the Bank, the officer in charge of personnel and the senior operations officer.  Occasionally a change in the Supervisor's rating is made, with the concurrence of the full committee.  Gary Shipp has been a member of the Salary Review Committee during the entire period relevant to this case.  However, he has no more influence over the employee ratings than do the two other committee members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Memorandum Opinion, Rec. at 398.  Thus, the same exclusively white supervisory staff that makes the hiring decisions also makes essentially all decisions affecting employees within their respective departments.  The Salary Review Committee represents the only aberration in this process, in that it rather than Shipp has the final say in salary decisions.  However, raises hinge on the score an employee receives from her supervisor's evaluation, and these evaluations are rarely disturbed by the reviewers.  In effect then, the supervisors for the most part determine an employee's raise as well as her initial rate of compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion certifying the class, the district court concluded that Watson had presented \"exactly that type of evidence\" envisioned by Falcon 's footnote 15.  Rec. at 220.  This evidence consisted of appellant's showing that Gary Shipp was \"responsible for both the hiring and promotion at defendant bank, and has been for over five years....  Although defendant asserts that Mr. Shipp does not make the hiring decisions, it is obvious he does have 'input' into those decisions, with the potential to 'sway' or otherwise influence their outcome through his discussions with the supervisors.  The evidence before the Court shows that Mr. Shipp reports directly to the bank officers and has never advanced a black to a position of supervisor.\"    Rec. at 221.  The district court therefore certified a class consisting of all blacks who have been employed by or applied for employment with the Bank since October 21, 1979, or who may apply to the bank in the future.  The court found that the class of applicants numbered over one hundred and the class of past and current black employees numbered fifteen as of June 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court remains free under Rule 23(c)(1) to reassess and alter its certification order at any time prior to a decision on the merits \"if, upon fuller development of the facts, the original determination appears unsound.\"    Advisory Committee Comment;  see also Richardson v. Byrd, supra, 709 F.2d at 1019.  The district court exercised this freedom in splitting the class and offered the following reasons:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon hearing trial testimony on the scope of Gary Shipp's participation in hiring and promotion decisions, the Court has determined that there is not a common question of law or fact between the unsuccessful black applicants and those blacks employed by the Bank.  The evidence showed that although Shipp has final authority over all personnel decisions, his function is largely one of reviewing decisions made by those department supervisors reporting to him.  The evidence showed that supervisors make hiring and promotion decisions for their departments, subject to Shipp's approval, and that as a general rule he defers to their judgment.  Supervisors also make the initial employee evaluation upon which raises are calculated, subject to approval by the three member Salary Review Committee.  Shipp is a member of the committee but does not have a disproportionate impact on the committee's decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, after hearing more evidence on the scope of Shipp's participation in the wide range of personnel decisions made by the Bank, the Court finds that Shipp did not make all hiring decisions and all subsequent decisions as to the employees' terms and conditions of employment.  Therefore, within the discretion under Rule 23 to alter the class certification, the Court finds that two distinct classes exist:  (1) those blacks who have applied to the Bank for employment since October 21, 1979, but were not hired and those blacks applying in the future;  and (2) those blacks who have been employed by the Bank since October 21, 1979.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rec. at 404.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's certification or decertification of a class only for an abuse of discretion, Richardson v.

When plaintiffs have demonstrated these facts or other common questions and issues, appellate courts have rarely hesitated in ordering the certification or recertification of the class.   See, e.g., Samuel v. University of Pittsburgh, 538 F.2d 991, 997 (3d Cir.1976) (recertification);  Marcera v. Chinlund, 595 F.2d 1231, 1237-40 (2d Cir.)

First, the same persons generally made the hiring, evaluation, and promotion decisions for their respective departments.  As the district court acknowledged, the \"evidence showed that supervisors make hiring and promotion decisions for their departments, subject to Shipp's approval, and that as a general rule he defers to their judgment.\"    Rec. at 404 (emphasis added).  These managerial arrangements are disturbed only when the three member Salary Review Committee intrudes to approve raises.  However, the supervisors who make the hiring and promotion decisions also make the initial employee evaluations on which the raises are strictly based, and these evaluations are seldom disturbed.  Thus, the fact that Shipp himself does not loom as prominently in the formulation and execution of personnel policy as once thought does little to undermine the pressing presence of a common question of fact concerning the role of the all-white supervisory personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority, however, would deny certification because \"the actual proof presented demonstrates that Watson's promotion claim was not typical of the applicant class claims.\"    This conclusion rests upon the following assertion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>Thus, assuming a common question was presented in the instant case, e.g., whether the same limited group of white supervisors discriminated in both hiring and promotions, that common question was not a central feature in the actual proof presented at trial.  The applicant class claims relied primarily on applicant flow statistics.  In contrast, the proof asserted in support of the promotions claims focused on statistical evidence of the Bank's treatment of black individuals in the employee evaluation process, promotions process, compensation process and other employment practices.  [emphasis added]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This assertion embodies a profound misunderstanding of what the statistical proof represents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's assertion is equivalent to nothing more than the following:  \"The applicant class claims relied on statistics relevant to the applicants, and the employee class claims relied on statistics relevant to the employees.\"    I fail to see how this can be fatal to typicality.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a>   First, there is no relevant \"contrast\".  Both sets of statistics represent the decisions of the same group of white supervisors.  The fact that these white supervisors were not raked over the coals or did not have their motives examined explicitly is irrelevant.  Statistical proof allows a plaintiff to infer and prove intent in the expected absence of candid admissions of intent to discriminate.  That is what statistical proof is all about.  Thus, the decisions of these white supervisors were indeed a central feature in the actual proof presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, proof of disparate treatment against a class of employees and applicants would be impossible without both sets of statistics.  If an employer discriminates against black applicants, a plausible inference is that he does not suddenly become a Frederick Douglass to his employees.  Each set of statistics bolsters the other and makes possible a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination.  There simply does not exist one all-encompassing statistical measure by which plaintiffs can describe the decisions affecting both applicants and employees.  The majority's requirement that the proof be identical for both groups is logically impossible and amounts to a requirement that the named plaintiff suffer injuries identical to those of the class members.  However,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>Had the Supreme Court in Falcon meant to require identical injuries, it would not have offered examples of ways to establish relationships between employment positions.  Nor would there remain a need for an analysis of typicality;  the representative plaintiff would either be or not be a member of the class.  This approach both undermines the congressional intent underlying Title VII and misconstrues the holding of Falcon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4 N.

Byrd, there was no established seniority or merit system and no written guidelines to assist in either hiring or promotion decisions.  \"Instead, promotions and [hires] were determined by the supervisors, ... all of whom were [white], based largely on subjective factors.\"   Id. at 1020.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Watson's ability to represent the class adequately, I find it particularly significant that the district court found, with complete support from the record, that \"plaintiff proceeded zealously on behalf of the group of blacks who applied for employment by the Bank, as well as those blacks employed by the Bank.\"    Rec. at 407.  Moreover, even though the district court split the employees from the applicants, it passed up the option of appointing a new representative<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a> and proceeded to reach the merits of the applicant class' claim on the basis of Watson's zealous representation.  Thus, on the record before me, I would hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding a lack of questions of law or fact common to the class, and I would direct the court to recertify the plaintiff class.

In fact, Ft. Worth Bank &amp; Trust, a not particularly large bank with approximately eighty employees in Ft.

When Watson began her career at the bank as a proof operator in August 1973, the bank employed four other blacks on its fifty member work force.  Two printed checks in the basement, one was a kitchen attendant, and the last was a porter.  The bank has never had a black director or officer, nor has it ever had a black supervisor.  Watson's unrebutted statistics indicate that a black who applies for a job at the bank has one-fourth the chance of a white applicant to get the job;  should the black be hired, her performance is apt to be evaluated thirty points lower and she is apt to be paid $46.00 per month less than an identically qualified white;  and the Bank is likely to advance her to greater responsibilities at a rate six-tenths of a pay grade per year more slowly than the equally qualified white.

At the outset, one is faced with appellant's contention that the district court erred in failing to assess her proof under the disparate impact model.

Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 496-97 n. 17, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1281 n. 17, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977);  Hazelwood School Dist. v.

Statisticians tend to discard chance as an explanation for a result when deviations from the expected value approach two standard deviations.\"   Payne v. Travenol, 673 F.2d at 821 n. 32 (providing formula). Thus, when the standard deviation exceeds two and an explanation from the defendant that something other than race explains the disparity is not forthcoming, the defendant will be held liable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs may also express statistical disparities in terms other than standard deviations.  For example, in this case, plaintiff has used a chi-square test to express her findings in terms of the statistical significance of a disparity.  A finding that a disparity is statistically significant \"at the 0.05 or 0.01 level\" means that there is a five percent or one percent probability, respectively, that the disparity is due to chance.  For large samples, the test of two or three standard deviations found by the Supreme Court to constitute sufficient proof \"is essentially equivalent to a rule requiring significance at a level in the range below 0.05 or 0.01.\"   Craik v.

Rec. at 119.  My own calculations show that the difference between the actual number of black offers and the expected value is greater than three standard deviations.  This pattern repeated itself to a somewhat lesser extent in appellant's analysis of offers to those applicants who specifically requested a teller position<sup>21</sup> (significant at 0.01) or a clerical position<sup>22</sup> (significant at 0.05).  In addition, appellant tested to see whether certain cycles in the bank's hiring period, during which the bank's hiring needs fluctuated, could account for the observed disparity.  Appellant looked for the possibility that blacks tended to apply in greater numbers when the bank's hiring needs were less.  However, the data indicate that blacks and whites did not apply at significantly different times vis-a-vis the bank's hiring cycle.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, for reasons unarticulated in its opinion, completely ignored these data.

Blacks represent 13.1% of defendant's non-exempt employees and 11.8% of the population of Tarrant County, 10.2% of the population of the Fort Worth Metropolitan area and 22.8% of the population of Fort Worth.  Accordingly, the Court finds that no discrimination against blacks as a class has been proved on the basis of defendant's hiring practices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rec. at 407.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a finding of fact, the district court's ultimate finding on the existence of discrimination may not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.   Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 1788, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).  A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if the reviewing court is left with \"the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   United States v.

Defendant argues correctly that population figures are preferable when the applicant flow data is shown to be significantly flawed.   Payne v. Travenol, 673 F.2d at 823.  However, absent significant flaws in the applicant flow data, these data are far more relevant than general population data to an analysis of an employer's hiring practices.

Assuming arguendo that the bank's non-exempt positions do require minimal qualifications--a point on which the defendant offered no evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>--the bank nonetheless suggested no reason to assume that these qualifications were unevenly distributed between blacks and whites.  Absent proof to the contrary, courts should decline to assume that blacks and whites do not possess the relevant qualifications in equal proportions.   Payne v. Travenol, 673 F.2d at 822;  De Medina v. Reinhardt, 686 F.2d 997, 1008 (D.C.Cir.1982).  The same argument applies with equal force to the bank's contention regarding duplicate submissions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the clear and unshaded light of appellant's statistical evidence, I would conclude that the district court's conclusion that appellant failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination in hiring is clearly erroneous.  Because the bank wholly failed to rebut appellant's proof, I conclude that the bank has discriminated against the class on the basis of race in its hiring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would conclude as well that the bank has discriminated on the basis of race against the employee members of the class.  By far the most compelling evidence on this point--and one that also went unrebutted--concerns the disparate treatment accorded the class in the evaluation process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   Over a period covering four annual evaluations, blacks rated an average of eleven to fifteen points lower than their non-black co-workers.  These differences are statistically significant from 0.05 to 0.001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>   In order to see whether factors other than race accounted for these disparities, appellant presented a multiple regression analysis of the data, controlling for the employees' prior experience and initial grade placement at the time of hire.  This analysis showed a coefficient for race of -34.37 on the first evaluation and -39.31 on the second evaluation, which means that, after controlling for the effects of experience and grade at hire, blacks scored 34.37 and 39.91 points below non-blacks on the first and second evaluations, respectively, during the period of the class.  Both coefficients are significant at 0.001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also analyzed the bank's promotions and compensation practices as they affected non-exempt employees.  Blacks averaged consistently less across the board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>   Because the presentation of raw averages alone is generally not considered probative of disparate treatment, see Pouncy v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, supra, 668 F.2d at 802-03, appellant conducted another multiple regression analysis to control for various factors--listed in note 29 below--that might have affected the averages.  This analysis again reflected significant disparate treatment of blacks, revealing a disparity in salary of $45.98 per month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>   This latter figure was statistically significant at .05, which appellant's expert characterized as \"compelling\" and \"actually kind of remarkable, given how much went into that equation and the quantity of the number of black employees.\"    Rec.Vol. V at 174.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's expert summarized his findings as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>[There] are race-related differences, most of them significant in all of those variables, both in the hiring part and in the treatment of present employees....

See, e.g., Davis v. Califano, 613 F.2d 957, 962 (D.C.Cir.1980) (\"[S]tatistical evidence may establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination in an individual case.\");   Reed v.

Carmichael v. Birmingham Saw Works, 738 F.2d 1126, 1131 (11th Cir.1984) (\"Statistics can be relevant and important in an individual case....  But statistics alone cannot make a case of individual disparate treatment.\").  We need not decide this issue since Watson established a prima facie case under Green without relying exclusively on statistical data.

See, e.g., Green, 411 U.S. at 804-05, 93 S.Ct. at 1825.  Thus, in this case, the statistical data which Watson presented remained pertinent even though the class was eventually decertified.

In title VII cases, the size of an attorney's fee award usually corresponds to the number of plaintiffs involved in the suit.

The trial judge read the Chief Justice's opinion to mean that a common question was present only when the same person made both hiring and promotion decisions.

U.S. Industries, Inc., 726 F.2d 1038 (5th Cir.1984), held that the disparate impact model could be properly applied to assess \"a promotional system which is based upon subjective selection criteria,\" because \"such a system can be facially neutral but yet be discriminatorily applied so that it impacts adversely on one group.\"   Id. at 1046.  In Griffin v. Carlin, 755 F.2d 1516 (11th Cir.1985), Judge Tuttle wrote that former Fifth Circuit precedent--with which Pouncy was found implicitly to be in conflict--\"allow[s] disparate impact challenges to the end result of multi-component selection procedures and to subjective selection procedures.\"   Id. at 1523.  The Griffin court also found that the use of disparate impact theory in those circumstances is appropriate in and of itself.   Accord Hawkins v. Bounds, 752 F.2d 500, 503 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n        <p>This dispute is not insignificant, as it directly affects a plaintiff's burden of proof.  In contrast to the plaintiff's burden under the disparate treatment model, plaintiff need not prove discriminatory motive under a disparate impact model, nor does a showing of disparate impact carry with it any implication of discriminatory intent.  Thus, while both models assess the \"impact\" of a defendant's employment practices upon the plaintiff class, this difference in the burden of proof creates a situation in which the threshold at which the impact triggers prima facie liability is significantly less under the disparate impact theory.   Page v. U.S. Industries, 726 F.2d at 1054 (disparate treatment requires showing of \"gross disparity,\" while a \"marked disproportion\" suffices to prove disparate impact).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> For an example of the perils of mixing uninformed judicial intuition with statistical analysis, see Pennsylvania v. Rizzo, 466 F.Supp. 1219, 1229 (E.D.Pa.1979), in which the district court found that a small sample size defeated plaintiffs' showing of statistical significance.  As pointed out in Baldus &amp; Cole, supra Sec. 9.1 (1985 Supp.), however, plaintiff's proof of statistical significance had already taken into account the sample size.  \"The court, in effect, double counted the influence of the small sample.\"    Id.

Using current white salaries as the dependent variable, the statistician first developed a model that would predict the salaries of whites given the following variables:  the employee's tenure, job grade, and date of departure.  The data were then plotted on a graph, with actual salary on the x-axis and \"residual\"--the difference between the actual salary and the predicted salary--on the y-axis.  The residual values ranged from -180 (indicating an actual salary $180 less than the predicted salary) through zero (where actual salary equals predicted salary) to + 180.  Horizontal lines were drawn at zero--to represent the expected value--and -150 and + 150--to represent two standard deviations.  The plotted data fell randomly on either side of the zero line and generally within the lines representing two standard deviations.  The distribution indicated that the graph accurately predicted white salaries</p>\n        <p>The next step in the analysis was to see whether the white model would predict black salaries to a statistically significant degree.  The data points all fell within two standard deviations of the expected value.  From this, the appellee's expert concluded that the graph described a situation where race was not a factor.  Rec.Vol. III at 232.</p>\n        <p>I would not consider this evidence sufficient to rebut appellant's showing for the following reason:  All but two of the eleven data points for blacks fall below the expected value.  In fact, the average residual value for blacks is -37.64, while the average for whites is, by definition, zero.  Thus, appellee's own model shows that blacks received on average $37.64 per month less than whites, which tends to corroborate rather than rebut appellant's finding that blacks received $45.98 less than whites.  While each individual data point might fall within two standard deviations of the expected value, this result fails to rebut appellant's evidence because the data points are skewed towards the low end of the scale.  In fact, appellee's expert's only comment on this distribution was a less than ringing endorsement:  \"Well, the data is not clearly normal, but, then, again, it is not clearly non-normal.\"    Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Texas Department of Community Affairs v.

The Bank promoted Watson to the position of teller trainee approximately two years later.  After a two to three month training period, Watson became a teller in the Bank's motor bank in January of 1976.  Subsequently, the Bank transferred Watson to the Bank's main lobby and later promoted Watson to the position of commercial teller on February 2, 1980.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the course of the next year, Watson unsuccessfully applied for four different promotions.  First, in February of 1980, Watson unsuccessfully applied for promotion to the position of supervisor of tellers, which became vacant due to the resignation of assistant cashier Brian England.  Watson;  Richard Burt, a white male who was then the supervisor of the bookkeeping department;  Gail Levitt, a white female who was then supervisor of motor bank tellers;  and Pat Cullar, a white female who was then a commercial teller, all applied for the position.  Gary Shipp, senior vice president and cashier at the Bank since 1977 and the person to whom the supervisor of tellers reported, selected Richard Burt as England's replacement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>   Second, Watson unsuccessfully applied for promotion to the position of motor bank teller supervisor.  Watson, Pat Cullar, and four or five other persons applied for the position vacated by Gail Levitt.  Pat Cullar received the promotion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>   Third, Watson unsuccessfully applied a second time for the position of lobby teller supervisor when the Bank again promoted Burt.  Watson, Cullar, Sylvia Hardin, a black female commercial teller, and Patsy Weatherly, a white female who was then supervisor of the proof department, all applied for the position.  Burt chose Cullar.  Fourth, as a result of Cullar's second promotion, the position of motor bank teller supervisor again became vacant, and Watson unsuccessfully applied for the position.  Other applicants included Hardin and Kevin Brown, a white male teller in the motor bank.  Based on Cullar's recommendation, Burt selected Brown for the position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson took a leave of absence from work in January 1981 in order to undergo foot surgery.  She applied for the last two described promotions while on sick leave.  Watson did not return to work after January of 1981, and she subsequently resigned in August of 1981.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Watson timely filed the instant suit on October 21, 1981, alleging that the Bank discriminated against her and other similarly situated persons on the basis of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e et seq.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After conducting an evidentiary hearing on the class certification issue, the district court certified a class consisting of \"blacks who applied to or were employed by defendant on or after October 21, 1979 or who may submit employment applications to defendant in the future.\"    Subsequently, the district court decertified the broad class of employees and applicants because the district court concluded, in light of all the evidence at trial, that there was not \"a common question of law or fact between the unsuccessful black applicants and those blacks employed by the Bank.\"    The district court then split the class into two distinct classes consisting of (1) black applicants and (2) black employees.  The district court further found that the class of black employees did not meet the numerosity requirement of Rule 23(a) and decertified the employee class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the merits, the district court concluded first that although Watson demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, she failed to demonstrate that the Bank's articulated reasons for failing to promote her were pretextual.  The district court then addressed the claims of the applicant class holding that Watson's statistical evidence failed to present a prima facie case of discrimination in hiring because the percentage of blacks in the Bank's work force mirrored the percentage of blacks in Tarrant County, Texas, and the Fort Worth metropolitan area, citing Hazelwood School District v.

For the following reasons, this Court affirms the judgment of the district court in part, but vacates the district court's judgment regarding the applicant class claims, remanding solely for the district court to dismiss the applicant class claims without prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

The \"entirely subjective decisionmaking process\" articulated in Footnote 15 presents one factual situation in which a putative class might meet the requirements of Rule 23(a).  Chief Justice Berger, in his concurring and dissenting opinion, suggests another:  Rule 23(a) might be met upon a showing that \"the same person or persons who made the challenged decisions were motivated by prejudice against [the protected class], and that this prejudice manifested itself in both the hiring decisions and the decisions not to promote [members of the class].\"  457 U.S. at 162 &amp; n., 102 S.Ct. at 2373 &amp; n.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the district court relied on the Chief Justice's opinion to certify a class composed of both applicants and employees.  After the evidentiary hearing, the district court found that a single individual, Gary Shipp, was responsible for both hiring and promotion decisions.  That fact, the district court reasoned, satisfied the commonality requirement for a class composed of both applicants and employees.  After the trial on the merits, however, the district court concluded that Shipp's role was more limited.  The evidence at trial demonstrated that a limited group of white department supervisors made all hiring and promotion decisions, as well as employee evaluations used to compute compensation, and that upper management routinely approved those decisions.  As a result, the district court concluded that Watson failed to show the existence of common questions between the applicants' and employees' claims because the same individual was not responsible for both hiring and promotion decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Watson asserts the district court erred because the commonality requirement may be satisfied by a showing that the same persons make both types of decisions.  Assuming, arguendo, that Watson is correct, this Court's inquiry does not end with that conclusion.  We cannot conclude that certification of a class of both employees and applicants is mandated merely because common questions exist.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>   Rather, the other factors enunciated in Rule 23(a) also must be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, assuming a common question was presented in the instant case, e.g., whether the same limited group of white supervisors discriminated in both hiring and promotions, that common question was not in fact a central feature in the actual proof presented at trial.  The applicant class claims relied primarily on applicant flow statistics.  In contrast, the proof asserted in support of the promotions claims focused on statistical evidence of the Bank's treatment of black individuals in the employee evaluation process, promotions process, compensation process and other employment practices.  Consequently, the actual proof presented demonstrates that Watson's promotion claim was not typical of the applicant class claims, and she was not an adequate class representative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court concludes that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to decertify the class because, as a practical matter, the \"maintenance of [Watson's] action as a class action did not advance 'the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of the procedure.' \"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   Falcon, 457 U.S. at 159, 102 S.Ct. at 2371 (quoting American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v.

Not only may the statistics be relevant at the initial stage of the litigation in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> but they are also relevant at the third stage of analysis when the plaintiff is attempting to prove that the reasons proffered by the defendant for its action are either unworthy of credence or mere pretexts for discrimination.   See, e.g., Green, 411 U.S. at 804-05, 93 S.Ct. at 1825.  In this case, the district court did not decide to decertify the class until after the trial had been completed and all the statistical evidence had been introduced.  Much of the evidence, of course, was related primarily to the plaintiff's class claims.  Even once the class claims dropped from the suit, however, the data retained relevance to the plaintiff's individual claim since it continued to bear on the veracity of the defendant's explanations for its promotion decisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing all the evidence, including the statistical evidence, the district court concluded that the reasons offered by the Bank were not pretextual.  We judge this holding under the clearly erroneous standard.   Pullman-Standard v.

We conclude that the district court's finding that the Bank's explanations for its action were not pretexts for discrimination is not clearly erroneous.  The district court's finding will not be set aside unless this Court on the entire evidence is left with the \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"   United States v.

Although the district court noted that Burt received excellent performance evaluations and that Cullar's and Watson's ratings were comparable, the district court clearly placed primary emphasis on Burt's and Cullar's experience in finding no discrimination and little emphasis on the employee evaluations.  This Court cannot say that the district court's ultimate finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court is more troubled by the Bank's promotion of Brown because Brown clearly had less experience than Watson.  The district court noted that Cullar highly recommended Brown for the promotion, relying on his performance as a teller and as her assistant.  In addition, the Bank relied on Brown's experience supervising temporary employees at Six Flags Over Texas.  Finally, the district court noted that Watson was on sick leave when the position became vacant and Brown, in contrast, was available immediately.  The Bank, however, failed to urge this last reason as a basis for its failure to promote Watson.  Disregarding this basis for upholding the district court's decision, the record nevertheless still supports \"two permissible views of the evidence.\"    Specifically, even though the reasons articulated for Brown's promotion are somewhat inconsistent with the Bank's articulated reasons for Burt's and Cullar's promotions, the district court clearly credited the Bank's explanation.  We do not find any inconsistency to be so striking as to make the Bank's proffered reasons incredible.  Consequently, this Court holds that the finding regarding the Brown promotion is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. THE APPLICANT CLASS CLAIMS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding that Watson was not an adequate representative of the applicant class because her promotion claims were not typical of the applicant claims, the district court nevertheless chose to address the merits of the applicant claims.  The district court found that Watson failed to present a prima facie case of race discrimination in hiring because the percentage of blacks in the Bank's work force mirrored the percentage of blacks in the population of Tarrant County and the Fort Worth metropolitan area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than address the correctness of the district court's reliance on population figures rather than applicant flow data, and we note parenthetically our grave concerns with the district court's approach, see Payne, 673 F.2d at 823-24, this Court vacates the judgment of the district court as it relates to the applicant class claims.  The case is remanded to the district court to dismiss the applicant claims without prejudice.  We note the unfair prejudice that might flow from a determination of the class claims when both the district court and this Court have held that the named plaintiff is not a proper class representative.

The erosion began with Vuyanich v. Republic National Bank,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> and it grows today with the majority's refusal to certify a class of applicants and employees in the face of common and typical questions of fact and law and unrebutted statistical proof of a class-wide pattern and practice of discrimination.  Nothing in Rule 23 or this circuit's interpretation of the rule compels this result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The class action has been the greatest instrument in enforcing Title VII's promise that invidious race discrimination shall have no role in the workplace.  Without the efficiency and economy of this procedural tool, it is safe to say that the injuries of thousands would have remained both undiscovered and unredressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>   And yet, in the name of the very efficiency and economy that give the class action its being, the majority disposes of only one individual's claim and forecloses forever proof of a pattern and practice of discrimination by appellee Ft. Worth Bank &amp; Trust (the bank).  The applicants must start over from square one,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> and the employees have no choice but to shoulder a far more onerous evidentiary burden and prosecute their claims one by one by one.  This result serves neither efficiency nor economy.  More significantly, it disserves Title VII by preventing the court from recognizing and eradicating what is, on the record before us, clearly a pattern and practice of discrimination.  The majority has left the substantive norms of Title VII twisting in the cold wind of the Fifth Circuit's Rule 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's opinion has at least two readily apparent consequences.  First, the opinion would compel a finding that the district court's initial decision to certify the class was an abuse of discretion.  This result is apparent because the nature of plaintiff's statistical proof--which the majority deems fatal to typicality--is the same whether one individual or a group of individuals makes the decisions affecting the class.  Thus, even if every single decision had been made exclusively by Shipp instead of the white supervisors, this circuit would now refuse to certify the class because the class representative, in the absence of a smoking gun, was forced to rely on separate sets of statistics to prove up intent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-2\" id=\"fn4-2_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, and more important, the majority consigns pattern and practice suits to the dustbin of this circuit's history.  Whether from inadvertance or fear of overflowing dockets, this circuit is erecting insurmountable obstacles to the full enforcement of Title VII.  This dam threatens to stop the flow of statutory rights and holds the promise of an arid and barren future.  The rights, duties, and liabilities that arise from the constitution and statutes flow freely and are not to be impeded by the fear that there will be a flood of cases.  We have heard this hue and cry since the days of the constitution's nativity, and it has never stopped our judicial instrumentalities from carrying out their duties.  It threatens to do so today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the matter directly at hand, this appeal raises two significant issues.  The first is whether the district court abused its discretion in bifurcating the class.  I believe that it did and would accordingly recertify the class.  The second issue, which the majority does not reach, is whether the plaintiff successfully established a prima facie case of class-wide disparate treatment.  I would answer this question in the affirmative as well, and hold in addition that the bank failed to rebut appellant's case.  Accordingly, I would reverse and remand for appropriate relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Class Certification</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"racial discrimination is by definition class discrimination,\" General Telephone Company of the Southwest v.

In holding that the district court had not erred in certifying the class, this court first noted that Falcon had not held \"that employees never can represent applicants or that an across-the-board class is never appropriate.\" Id. at 1020.  The court then found a \"sufficient Rule 23(a) nexus\" in the defendant Sheriff's practice of restricting the assignment of all new female deputies to the jail, a practice which, because the number of positions offered females was smaller than that offered males, necessarily limited the number of females that could then be transferred to more desirable positions in the Sheriff's office.  The court found \"this connection between employees assigned to the jail and job applicants ... plainly sufficient to support a class of both.\"   Id. at 1020.  The court then found that the named plaintiff was a proper class representative because \"her claim involved issues of law or fact common to those of applicants and employees assigned to the jail.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court based this finding on plaintiff's showing that the</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sheriff's employment practices were infected by the \"entirely subjective decision-making processes\" recognized in Falcon as a manifestation of policy whose impact might be sufficient to connect otherwise differently situated persons.  The district court found that \"[t]he Sheriff's Office had no established seniority or merit system to determine eligibility for transfer o[r] promotion.  Nor did it have written guidelines for promotion or transfers.  Instead, promotions and transfers were determined by the supervisors, almost all of whom were male, based largely on subjective factors.\"    This finding demonstrates that \"discrimination in its broadest sense\" was not the only claim common to Richardson and the class she sought to represent.

Shipp rarely vetoes hiring decisions made by those supervisors reporting to him.  Shipp personally interviews some applicants but makes the final hiring decisions only for those persons working directly under his supervision.  During all periods relevant to this suit, Shipp had final authority over all personnel matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Performance evaluations and promotion decisions are made by the supervisors for those employees under their authority.  Since 1978 employees have been given yearly written evaluations which are completed by their supervisors.  Salary increases are calculated on the basis of the performance ratings.  The supervisors present the evaluations to the Salary Review Committee, which consists of the president or executive vice president of the Bank, the officer in charge of personnel and the senior operations officer.  Occasionally a change in the Supervisor's rating is made, with the concurrence of the full committee.  Gary Shipp has been a member of the Salary Review Committee during the entire period relevant to this case.  However, he has no more influence over the employee ratings than do the two other committee members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Memorandum Opinion, Rec. at 398.  Thus, the same exclusively white supervisory staff that makes the hiring decisions also makes essentially all decisions affecting employees within their respective departments.  The Salary Review Committee represents the only aberration in this process, in that it rather than Shipp has the final say in salary decisions.  However, raises hinge on the score an employee receives from her supervisor's evaluation, and these evaluations are rarely disturbed by the reviewers.  In effect then, the supervisors for the most part determine an employee's raise as well as her initial rate of compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its opinion certifying the class, the district court concluded that Watson had presented \"exactly that type of evidence\" envisioned by Falcon 's footnote 15.  Rec. at 220.  This evidence consisted of appellant's showing that Gary Shipp was \"responsible for both the hiring and promotion at defendant bank, and has been for over five years....  Although defendant asserts that Mr. Shipp does not make the hiring decisions, it is obvious he does have 'input' into those decisions, with the potential to 'sway' or otherwise influence their outcome through his discussions with the supervisors.  The evidence before the Court shows that Mr. Shipp reports directly to the bank officers and has never advanced a black to a position of supervisor.\"    Rec. at 221.  The district court therefore certified a class consisting of all blacks who have been employed by or applied for employment with the Bank since October 21, 1979, or who may apply to the bank in the future.  The court found that the class of applicants numbered over one hundred and the class of past and current black employees numbered fifteen as of June 1982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court remains free under Rule 23(c)(1) to reassess and alter its certification order at any time prior to a decision on the merits \"if, upon fuller development of the facts, the original determination appears unsound.\"    Advisory Committee Comment;  see also Richardson v.

The evidence showed that although Shipp has final authority over all personnel decisions, his function is largely one of reviewing decisions made by those department supervisors reporting to him.  The evidence showed that supervisors make hiring and promotion decisions for their departments, subject to Shipp's approval, and that as a general rule he defers to their judgment.  Supervisors also make the initial employee evaluation upon which raises are calculated, subject to approval by the three member Salary Review Committee.  Shipp is a member of the committee but does not have a disproportionate impact on the committee's decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, after hearing more evidence on the scope of Shipp's participation in the wide range of personnel decisions made by the Bank, the Court finds that Shipp did not make all hiring decisions and all subsequent decisions as to the employees' terms and conditions of employment.  Therefore, within the discretion under Rule 23 to alter the class certification, the Court finds that two distinct classes exist:  (1) those blacks who have applied to the Bank for employment since October 21, 1979, but were not hired and those blacks applying in the future;  and (2) those blacks who have been employed by the Bank since October 21, 1979.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rec. at 404.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's certification or decertification of a class only for an abuse of discretion, Richardson v.

First, the same persons generally made the hiring, evaluation, and promotion decisions for their respective departments.  As the district court acknowledged, the \"evidence showed that supervisors make hiring and promotion decisions for their departments, subject to Shipp's approval, and that as a general rule he defers to their judgment.\"    Rec. at 404 (emphasis added).  These managerial arrangements are disturbed only when the three member Salary Review Committee intrudes to approve raises.  However, the supervisors who make the hiring and promotion decisions also make the initial employee evaluations on which the raises are strictly based, and these evaluations are seldom disturbed.  Thus, the fact that Shipp himself does not loom as prominently in the formulation and execution of personnel policy as once thought does little to undermine the pressing presence of a common question of fact concerning the role of the all-white supervisory personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority, however, would deny certification because \"the actual proof presented demonstrates that Watson's promotion claim was not typical of the applicant class claims.\"    This conclusion rests upon the following assertion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>Thus, assuming a common question was presented in the instant case, e.g., whether the same limited group of white supervisors discriminated in both hiring and promotions, that common question was not a central feature in the actual proof presented at trial.  The applicant class claims relied primarily on applicant flow statistics.

Both sets of statistics represent the decisions of the same group of white supervisors.  The fact that these white supervisors were not raked over the coals or did not have their motives examined explicitly is irrelevant.  Statistical proof allows a plaintiff to infer and prove intent in the expected absence of candid admissions of intent to discriminate.  That is what statistical proof is all about.  Thus, the decisions of these white supervisors were indeed a central feature in the actual proof presented at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, proof of disparate treatment against a class of employees and applicants would be impossible without both sets of statistics.  If an employer discriminates against black applicants, a plausible inference is that he does not suddenly become a Frederick Douglass to his employees.  Each set of statistics bolsters the other and makes possible a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination.  There simply does not exist one all-encompassing statistical measure by which plaintiffs can describe the decisions affecting both applicants and employees.  The majority's requirement that the proof be identical for both groups is logically impossible and amounts to a requirement that the named plaintiff suffer injuries identical to those of the class members.

Nor would there remain a need for an analysis of typicality;  the representative plaintiff would either be or not be a member of the class.  This approach both undermines the congressional intent underlying Title VII and misconstrues the holding of Falcon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4 N.

First, as will be clear from the impending discussion of the bank's liability,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> plaintiff presented \"significant proof\" that the bank operated under a \"general policy of discrimination.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a>   Second, \"the discrimination manifested itself in the same general fashion\"--first, as already discussed, through the common bond of the supervisors and Shipp;  and second, through \"an entirely subjective decisionmaking process.\"    As in Richardson v. Byrd, there was no established seniority or merit system and no written guidelines to assist in either hiring or promotion decisions.  \"Instead, promotions and [hires] were determined by the supervisors, ... all of whom were [white], based largely on subjective factors.\"   Id. at 1020.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Watson's ability to represent the class adequately, I find it particularly significant that the district court found, with complete support from the record, that \"plaintiff proceeded zealously on behalf of the group of blacks who applied for employment by the Bank, as well as those blacks employed by the Bank.\"    Rec. at 407.  Moreover, even though the district court split the employees from the applicants, it passed up the option of appointing a new representative<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a> and proceeded to reach the merits of the applicant class' claim on the basis of Watson's zealous representation.  Thus, on the record before me, I would hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding a lack of questions of law or fact common to the class, and I would direct the court to recertify the plaintiff class.

When Watson began her career at the bank as a proof operator in August 1973, the bank employed four other blacks on its fifty member work force.  Two printed checks in the basement, one was a kitchen attendant, and the last was a porter.  The bank has never had a black director or officer, nor has it ever had a black supervisor.  Watson's unrebutted statistics indicate that a black who applies for a job at the bank has one-fourth the chance of a white applicant to get the job;  should the black be hired, her performance is apt to be evaluated thirty points lower and she is apt to be paid $46.00 per month less than an identically qualified white;  and the Bank is likely to advance her to greater responsibilities at a rate six-tenths of a pay grade per year more slowly than the equally qualified white.

Defendant argues correctly that population figures are preferable when the applicant flow data is shown to be significantly flawed.   Payne v. Travenol, 673 F.2d at 823.  However, absent significant flaws in the applicant flow data, these data are far more relevant than general population data to an analysis of an employer's hiring practices.   Id. at 834-24;  see also Hazelwood, 97 S.Ct. at 2742 n. 13 (applicant flow data \"very relevant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bank's only attack on the applicant flow data is a claim that the data fail to take into account either the applicants' qualifications or the possibility that duplicative applications skew the data base.  Assuming arguendo that the bank's non-exempt positions do require minimal qualifications--a point on which the defendant offered no evidence<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>--the bank nonetheless suggested no reason to assume that these qualifications were unevenly distributed between blacks and whites.  Absent proof to the contrary, courts should decline to assume that blacks and whites do not possess the relevant qualifications in equal proportions.   Payne v. Travenol, 673 F.2d at 822;  De Medina v. Reinhardt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"407895\"><a href=\"/opinion/407895/luba-s-kowalyszyn-de-medina-v-john-e-reinhardt-director-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">686</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">997</span></a></span>, 1008 (D.C.Cir.1982).  The same argument applies with equal force to the bank's contention regarding duplicate submissions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the clear and unshaded light of appellant's statistical evidence, I would conclude that the district court's conclusion that appellant failed to make out a prima facie case of discrimination in hiring is clearly erroneous.  Because the bank wholly failed to rebut appellant's proof, I conclude that the bank has discriminated against the class on the basis of race in its hiring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would conclude as well that the bank has discriminated on the basis of race against the employee members of the class.  By far the most compelling evidence on this point--and one that also went unrebutted--concerns the disparate treatment accorded the class in the evaluation process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a>   Over a period covering four annual evaluations, blacks rated an average of eleven to fifteen points lower than their non-black co-workers.  These differences are statistically significant from 0.05 to 0.001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>   In order to see whether factors other than race accounted for these disparities, appellant presented a multiple regression analysis of the data, controlling for the employees' prior experience and initial grade placement at the time of hire.  This analysis showed a coefficient for race of -34.37 on the first evaluation and -39.31 on the second evaluation, which means that, after controlling for the effects of experience and grade at hire, blacks scored 34.37 and 39.91 points below non-blacks on the first and second evaluations, respectively, during the period of the class.  Both coefficients are significant at 0.001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also analyzed the bank's promotions and compensation practices as they affected non-exempt employees.  Blacks averaged consistently less across the board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a>   Because the presentation of raw averages alone is generally not considered probative of disparate treatment, see Pouncy v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America, supra, 668 F.2d at 802-03, appellant conducted another multiple regression analysis to control for various factors--listed in note 29 below--that might have affected the averages.  This analysis again reflected significant disparate treatment of blacks, revealing a disparity in salary of $45.98 per month.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a>   This latter figure was statistically significant at .05, which appellant's expert characterized as \"compelling\" and \"actually kind of remarkable, given how much went into that equation and the quantity of the number of black employees.\"    Rec.Vol. V at 174.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's expert summarized his findings as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p>[There] are race-related differences, most of them significant in all of those variables, both in the hiring part and in the treatment of present employees....  You get a consistent pattern of race-related differences, depending on how many people you have and what the--the number of characteristics you are talking about.  Sometimes it is stronger than others, but it is very, very consistent in one particular direction....

An individual can bring an action only if he can find an attorney willing to take his case.  A plaintiff suing individually or on behalf of a small class may find it difficult to procure a competent attorney.  In title VII cases, the size of an attorney's fee award usually corresponds to the number of plaintiffs involved in the suit.  As the number of plaintiffs decreases, so too does the attorney's incentive to handle the case.  Thus, a person may find it impossible to bring an individual suit or a narrow class action even when he has a meritorious claim.</p>\n        <p>Note, Certifying Classes and Subclasses in Title VII Suits, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 619, 626 (1986).

The trial judge read the Chief Justice's opinion to mean that a common question was present only when the same person made both hiring and promotion decisions.

U.S. Industries, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"430902\"><a href=\"/opinion/430902/34-fair-emplpraccas-430-33-empl-prac-dec-p-34249-john-page-and-don/\"><span class=\"volume\">726</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1984), held that the disparate impact model could be properly applied to assess \"a promotional system which is based upon subjective selection criteria,\" because \"such a system can be facially neutral but yet be discriminatorily applied so that it impacts adversely on one group.\"   Id. at 1046.  In Griffin v. Carlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"448953\"><a href=\"/opinion/448953/ernest-l-griffin-cross-appellees-v-carl-carlin-postmaster-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1516</span></a></span> (11th Cir.1985), Judge Tuttle wrote that former Fifth Circuit precedent--with which Pouncy was found implicitly to be in conflict--\"allow[s] disparate impact challenges to the end result of multi-component selection procedures and to subjective selection procedures.\"   Id. at 1523.  The Griffin court also found that the use of disparate impact theory in those circumstances is appropriate in and of itself.   Accord Hawkins v. Bounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446635\"><a href=\"/opinion/446635/36-fair-emplpraccas-1285-36-empl-prac-dec-p-34940-jerue-b-hawkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">752</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 503 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n        <p>This dispute is not insignificant, as it directly affects a plaintiff's burden of proof.  In contrast to the plaintiff's burden under the disparate treatment model, plaintiff need not prove discriminatory motive under a disparate impact model, nor does a showing of disparate impact carry with it any implication of discriminatory intent.  Thus, while both models assess the \"impact\" of a defendant's employment practices upon the plaintiff class, this difference in the burden of proof creates a situation in which the threshold at which the impact triggers prima facie liability is significantly less under the disparate impact theory.   Page v. U.S. Industries, 726 F.2d at 1054 (disparate treatment requires showing of \"gross disparity,\" while a \"marked disproportion\" suffices to prove disparate impact).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> For an example of the perils of mixing uninformed judicial intuition with statistical analysis, see Pennsylvania v.

As pointed out in Baldus &amp; Cole, supra Sec. 9.1 (1985 Supp.), however, plaintiff's proof of statistical significance had already taken into account the sample size.  \"The court, in effect, double counted the influence of the small sample.\"    Id.

None of the black witnesses, however, had any knowledge of the statistical disparities.  At best, these witnesses rebut any anecdotal evidence.  Where the plaintiff is relying on statistical evidence, however, these witnesses are about as useful as a football in a game of basketball.

Using current white salaries as the dependent variable, the statistician first developed a model that would predict the salaries of whites given the following variables:  the employee's tenure, job grade, and date of departure.  The data were then plotted on a graph, with actual salary on the x-axis and \"residual\"--the difference between the actual salary and the predicted salary--on the y-axis.  The residual values ranged from -180 (indicating an actual salary $180 less than the predicted salary) through zero (where actual salary equals predicted salary) to + 180.  Horizontal lines were drawn at zero--to represent the expected value--and -150 and + 150--to represent two standard deviations.  The plotted data fell randomly on either side of the zero line and generally within the lines representing two standard deviations.  The distribution indicated that the graph accurately predicted white salaries</p>\n        <p>The next step in the analysis was to see whether the white model would predict black salaries to a statistically significant degree.  The data points all fell within two standard deviations of the expected value.  From this, the appellee's expert concluded that the graph described a situation where race was not a factor.  Rec.Vol. III at 232.</p>\n        <p>I would not consider this evidence sufficient to rebut appellant's showing for the following reason:  All but two of the eleven data points for blacks fall below the expected value.  In fact, the average residual value for blacks is -37.64, while the average for whites is, by definition, zero.  Thus, appellee's own model shows that blacks received on average $37.64 per month less than whites, which tends to corroborate rather than rebut appellant's finding that blacks received $45.98 less than whites.  While each individual data point might fall within two standard deviations of the expected value, this result fails to rebut appellant's evidence because the data points are skewed towards the low end of the scale.  In fact, appellee's expert's only comment on this distribution was a less than ringing endorsement:  \"Well, the data is not clearly normal, but, then, again, it is not clearly non-normal.\"    Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn32\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32_ref\">32</a>\n        <p> See, e.g., Texas Department of Community Affairs v.
