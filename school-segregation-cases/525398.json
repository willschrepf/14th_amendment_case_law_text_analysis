For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n                                                I.\n                                  FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n       Gray is an inmate incarcerated in the Idaho Correctional Institution-Orofino in protective\ncustody.   Gray was issued a disciplinary offense report (DOR) for the theft of a sack of\ncommissary. He was placed in a segregation cell pending the investigation and hearing of the\nDOR. While waiting for his hearing, inmates housed in the cell immediately above Gray\nallegedly poured excrement through the vents and into his cell. Gray notified prison staff of the\nsituation, and the staff moved Gray to a different cell once space became available. At the\ndisciplinary hearing for the DOR, Gray’s theft charge was confirmed and he was given seven\ndays of detention and ordered to pay restitution. At some point during this process, Gray\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fallegedly went a period of time without toilet paper. He claims to have developed constipation\nand was treated with magnesium citrate.\n       Gray filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus relief with the district court. In his\npetition, he claimed that his constitutional rights and protections were violated in his disciplinary\nproceeding. Further, he alleged several issues regarding the conditions of his confinement. The\ndistrict court summarily dismissed the petition upon motion by the State. Gray timely appeals.\n                                                 II.\n                                           ANALYSIS\n       Gray claims that the conditions of his confinement violated his due process rights. The\nwrit of habeas corpus is a constitutionally-mandated mechanism to effect the discharge of an\nindividual from unlawful confinement. See IDAHO CONST. art. I, § 5; I.C. §§ 19-4201 to 19-\n4226; Mahaffey v. State, 87 Idaho 228, 231, 392 P.2d 279, 280 (1964); Gawron v. Roberts, 113\nIdaho 330, 333, 743 P.2d 983, 986 (Ct. App. 1987). The essence of habeas corpus is an attack\nupon the legality of a person’s detention for the purpose of securing release where custody is\nillegal and is an avenue by which relief can be sought where detention of an individual is in\nviolation of a fundamental right. In re Robinson, 107 Idaho 1055, 1057, 695 P.2d 440, 442 (Ct.\nApp. 1985). An in-state prisoner may file a petition for writ of habeas corpus to request that a\ncourt inquire into state or federal constitutional questions concerning conditions of confinement,\nthe revocation of parole, miscalculation of a sentence, loss of good time credits, or detainers\nlodged against the prisoner. I.C. § 19-4203(2)(a)-(e). Habeas corpus may not be used as a\nsubstitute for, or in addition to, a direct appeal of a criminal conviction or proceeding under\nIdaho Criminal Rule 35 or the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedures Act. I.C. § 19-4203(4).\n       The decision to issue a writ of habeas corpus is a matter within the discretion of the court.\nJohnson v. State, 85 Idaho 123, 127, 376 P.2d 704, 706 (1962); Brennan v. State, 122 Idaho 911,\n914, 841 P.2d 441, 444 (Ct. App. 1992). When we review an exercise of discretion in a habeas\ncorpus proceeding, we conduct a three-tiered inquiry to determine whether the lower court\nrightly perceived the issue as one of discretion, acted within the boundaries of such discretion,\nand reached its decision by an exercise of reason. Brennan, 122 Idaho at 914, 841 P.2d at 444;\nSivak v. Ada County, 115 Idaho 762, 763, 769 P.2d 1134, 1135 (Ct. App. 1989). If a petitioner is\nnot entitled to relief on an application for a writ of habeas corpus, the decision by the petitioned\ncourt to dismiss the application without an evidentiary hearing will be upheld. Brennan, 122\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fIdaho at 917, 841 P.2d at 447. When a court considers matters outside the pleadings on an\nI.R.C.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, such motion must be treated as a motion for summary\njudgment. Hellickson v. Jenkins, 118 Idaho 273, 276, 796 P.2d 150, 153 (Ct. App. 1990).\n       Gray claims that he was deprived of due process as a result of his confinement. To\ndetermine whether an individual’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution have been violated, a court must undertake a two-step analysis. It\nmust first determine whether the individual’s threatened interest is a liberty or property interest\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. Schevers v. State, 129 Idaho 573, 575, 930 P.2d 603, 605\n(1996); Smith v. Meridian Joint School Dist. No. 2, 128 Idaho 714, 722, 918 P.2d 583, 591\n(1996). Only if the court finds a liberty or property interest will it proceed to the next step, in\nwhich it determines the extent of due process procedural protections. Smith, 128 Idaho at 722,\n918 P.2d at 591. The United States Supreme Court held that any liberty interest that is protected\nis generally limited to an interest in freedom from restraint which imposed an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin v.\nConner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). In other words, courts look at whether the restrictions\nconstitute a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of prison life. Id. at 484-85. The Idaho\nSupreme Court adopted the “atypical and significant hardship” test in Schevers, holding that this\ntest is applicable to claims arising under the Idaho Constitution’s Due Process Clause. Schevers,\n129 Idaho at 575-78, 930 P.2d at 605-08.\n       In this instance, Gray alleges that the conditions of his confinement constituted an\natypical and significant hardship sufficient to raise a protected liberty interest. Specifically, Gray\ncontends that: (1) he was placed in an unsanitary cell containing fecal matter; (2) he was forced\nto hold his bowel movements because he was not provided with toilet paper; and (3) his\nconditions in segregation and protective custody differed. 1 As to Gray’s first contention, he\n\n\n1\n         There are several additional issues raised by Gray that we do not address. Gray raised\nseveral issues in the district court that he does not raise on appeal. These issues regard his\ndisciplinary hearing proceedings. Specifically, Gray claimed that the hearing officer was\nprejudiced, that his staff advisor was ineffective, and that he was not given an adequate number\nof witness statement forms. The district court found that Gray’s constitutional rights and\nprotections were not violated in his disciplinary hearing. Gray does not raise these claims in his\ninitial brief to this Court. Nonetheless, the State argues against these claims in its brief, and Gray\nmentions the claims in passing in his reply brief. If an issue is “mentioned in passing and not\nsupported by any cogent argument or authority, it cannot be considered by this Court.” Trotter v.\n\n                                                  3\n\fasserts that he was left for days in an unsanitary cell that left him exposed to excrement. Further,\nhe alleges that he was given no cleaning supplies, no gloves, and no plastic bags to clean his cell.\nHe claims that his confinement in an unsanitary cell is akin to cruel and unusual punishment and,\ntherefore, constitutes an atypical and significant hardship. We determine that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in summarily dismissing this claim. The district court found that\nfollowing the alleged theft of the sack of commissary, Gray was placed in the only available cell.\nAfter being notified of the conditions of his cell, prison staff moved Gray to a different cell as\nsoon as one became available. The district court further found that Gray was provided with\ncleaning supplies “in conformance with the policy of the institution similar to those supplies\nprovided to the general population.” Additionally, a member of the prison staff swore in an\naffidavit that cleaning supplies were delivered to the unit each week, and an inmate janitor\nmaintained and refilled the supplies. Further, additional supplies were available upon request.\nTherefore, the district court properly exercised its reasoning in finding that Gray’s confinement\nwas not an atypical and significant hardship “when compared to the conditions of confinement in\nthe general prison population.”\n       As to Gray’s second contention, he asserts that the lack of toilet paper caused him\nextreme constipation and required him to obtain medical assistance. He claims that the creation\nof a medical problem constitutes an atypical and significant hardship, thus violating due process.\n\n\n\n\nBank of New York Mellon, 152 Idaho 842, 848, 275 P.3d 857, 863 (2012) (citing Dawson v.\nCheyovich Family Trust, 149 Idaho 375, 382-83, 234 P.3d 699, 706-07 (2010)). Since Gray only\nmentions these claims in passing in response to the State, and such claims are not supported with\nargument or authority, we will not address them. Gray raises two issues to this Court that he did\nnot raise below. First, Gray claims that his punishment requiring him to pay restitution is\nimproper because he had a heightened due process right when his property was at stake. Gray\ndid not raise this issue below. Second, Gray asserts that his disciplinary detention was excessive\nbecause he spent sixty-five days in segregation. Gray did not raise this issue in his initial\npetition, but the issue was mentioned in passing in Gray’s response to the State’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Accordingly, the district court did not provide a ruling regarding Gray’s\nrestitution claim or his length of segregation claim. Generally, issues not raised below may not\nbe considered for the first time on appeal. State v. Fodge, 121 Idaho 192, 195, 824 P.2d 123, 126\n(1992). Therefore, we will not address these issues. Gray requested that the disciplinary hearing\nfinding him guilty of theft be expunged from his record. The district court refused to address the\nmerits of the disciplinary case and refused to second guess the findings of the hearing officer.\nWe will also not address this issue in this habeas corpus matter.\n\n                                                 4\n\fHe also claims that inmates in segregation receive one roll of toilet paper each week, whereas the\ngeneral population receives two rolls each week.         The district court found that Gray was\nprovided with toilet paper in conformance with policy, and that he “could have obtained\nadditional supplies of toilet paper upon request.” We agree. The record demonstrates that two\nrolls of toilet paper were provided to each inmate, and an inmate can request additional toilet\npaper in exchange for the cardboard core of a used toilet paper roll. Further, the lack of toilet\npaper is not an atypical and significant hardship sufficient to invoke a liberty interest. Therefore,\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in summarily dismissing this claim.\n        As to Gray’s third contention, he asserts that conditions in segregation are different than\nconditions in protective custody.     The district court divided this general claim into seven\ndifferent assertions. These assertions are: (1) he had an unclean cell; (2) he had a lack of\ncleaning supplies; (3) he had an insufficient amount of toilet paper; (4) he had a lack of soap in\nhis cell; (5) he had unclean clothes supplied to him; (6) he had no religious advisor available to\nhim; and (7) he was required to wear pink clothing. The district court found that Gray had not\nexhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his complaints regarding the unclean\nclothes, the religious advisor, and wearing pink clothing. Idaho Code § 19-4206 requires habeas\ncorpus petitioners to exhaust administrative remedies in order to avoid dismissal. Accordingly,\nthe district court did not address those claims.       We will not address the issues for which\nadministrative remedies were not exhausted. The remaining issues are addressed above. Gray is\nnot entitled to relief regarding alleged differences between segregation and protective custody\nconditions.\n                                                III.\n                                         CONCLUSION\n        The district court did not abuse its discretion in summarily dismissing Gray’s petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus relief. Thus, we affirm the summary dismissal of Gray’s habeas corpus\npetition.\n        Judge GUTIERREZ and Judge MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f",

To\ndetermine whether an individual’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution have been violated, a court must undertake a two-step analysis. It\nmust first determine whether the individual’s threatened interest is a liberty or property interest\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. Schevers v.

Only if the court finds a liberty or property interest will it proceed to the next step, in\nwhich it determines the extent of due process procedural protections. Smith, 128 Idaho at 722,\n918 P.2d at 591. The United States Supreme Court held that any liberty interest that is protected\nis generally limited to an interest in freedom from restraint which imposed an “atypical and\nsignificant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin v.\nConner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995). In other words, courts look at whether the restrictions\nconstitute a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of prison life. Id. at 484-85. The Idaho\nSupreme Court adopted the “atypical and significant hardship” test in Schevers, holding that this\ntest is applicable to claims arising under the Idaho Constitution’s Due Process Clause. Schevers,\n129 Idaho at 575-78, 930 P.2d at 605-08.\n       In this instance, Gray alleges that the conditions of his confinement constituted an\natypical and significant hardship sufficient to raise a protected liberty interest. Specifically, Gray\ncontends that: (1) he was placed in an unsanitary cell containing fecal matter; (2) he was forced\nto hold his bowel movements because he was not provided with toilet paper; and (3) his\nconditions in segregation and protective custody differed. 1 As to Gray’s first contention, he\n\n\n1\n         There are several additional issues raised by Gray that we do not address. Gray raised\nseveral issues in the district court that he does not raise on appeal. These issues regard his\ndisciplinary hearing proceedings. Specifically, Gray claimed that the hearing officer was\nprejudiced, that his staff advisor was ineffective, and that he was not given an adequate number\nof witness statement forms. The district court found that Gray’s constitutional rights and\nprotections were not violated in his disciplinary hearing. Gray does not raise these claims in his\ninitial brief to this Court. Nonetheless, the State argues against these claims in its brief, and Gray\nmentions the claims in passing in his reply brief. If an issue is “mentioned in passing and not\nsupported by any cogent argument or authority, it cannot be considered by this Court.” Trotter v.\n\n                                                  3\n\fasserts that he was left for days in an unsanitary cell that left him exposed to excrement. Further,\nhe alleges that he was given no cleaning supplies, no gloves, and no plastic bags to clean his cell.\nHe claims that his confinement in an unsanitary cell is akin to cruel and unusual punishment and,\ntherefore, constitutes an atypical and significant hardship. We determine that the district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in summarily dismissing this claim. The district court found that\nfollowing the alleged theft of the sack of commissary, Gray was placed in the only available cell.\nAfter being notified of the conditions of his cell, prison staff moved Gray to a different cell as\nsoon as one became available. The district court further found that Gray was provided with\ncleaning supplies “in conformance with the policy of the institution similar to those supplies\nprovided to the general population.” Additionally, a member of the prison staff swore in an\naffidavit that cleaning supplies were delivered to the unit each week, and an inmate janitor\nmaintained and refilled the supplies. Further, additional supplies were available upon request.\nTherefore, the district court properly exercised its reasoning in finding that Gray’s confinement\nwas not an atypical and significant hardship “when compared to the conditions of confinement in\nthe general prison population.”\n       As to Gray’s second contention, he asserts that the lack of toilet paper caused him\nextreme constipation and required him to obtain medical assistance. He claims that the creation\nof a medical problem constitutes an atypical and significant hardship, thus violating due process.\n\n\n\n\nBank of New York Mellon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 848, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874019\"><a href=\"/opinion/874019/trotter-v-bank-of-new-york-mellon/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 863 (2012) (citing Dawson v.\nCheyovich Family Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382-83, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874251\"><a href=\"/opinion/874251/dawson-v-cheyovich-family-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706-07 (2010)). Since Gray only\nmentions these claims in passing in response to the State, and such claims are not supported with\nargument or authority, we will not address them. Gray raises two issues to this Court that he did\nnot raise below. First, Gray claims that his punishment requiring him to pay restitution is\nimproper because he had a heightened due process right when his property was at stake. Gray\ndid not raise this issue below. Second, Gray asserts that his disciplinary detention was excessive\nbecause he spent sixty-five days in segregation. Gray did not raise this issue in his initial\npetition, but the issue was mentioned in passing in Gray’s response to the State’s motion for\nsummary judgment. Accordingly, the district court did not provide a ruling regarding Gray’s\nrestitution claim or his length of segregation claim. Generally, issues not raised below may not\nbe considered for the first time on appeal. State v. Fodge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203372\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203372/state-v-fodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203372\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203372/state-v-fodge/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126\n(1992). Therefore, we will not address these issues. Gray requested that the disciplinary hearing\nfinding him guilty of theft be expunged from his record. The district court refused to address the\nmerits of the disciplinary case and refused to second guess the findings of the hearing officer.\nWe will also not address this issue in this habeas corpus matter.\n\n                                                 4\n\fHe also claims that inmates in segregation receive one roll of toilet paper each week, whereas the\ngeneral population receives two rolls each week.         The district court found that Gray was\nprovided with toilet paper in conformance with policy, and that he “could have obtained\nadditional supplies of toilet paper upon request.” We agree. The record demonstrates that two\nrolls of toilet paper were provided to each inmate, and an inmate can request additional toilet\npaper in exchange for the cardboard core of a used toilet paper roll. Further, the lack of toilet\npaper is not an atypical and significant hardship sufficient to invoke a liberty interest. Therefore,\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in summarily dismissing this claim.\n        As to Gray’s third contention, he asserts that conditions in segregation are different than\nconditions in protective custody.     The district court divided this general claim into seven\ndifferent assertions. These assertions are: (1) he had an unclean cell; (2) he had a lack of\ncleaning supplies; (3) he had an insufficient amount of toilet paper; (4) he had a lack of soap in\nhis cell; (5) he had unclean clothes supplied to him; (6) he had no religious advisor available to\nhim; and (7) he was required to wear pink clothing. The district court found that Gray had not\nexhausted his administrative remedies with respect to his complaints regarding the unclean\nclothes, the religious advisor, and wearing pink clothing. Idaho Code § 19-4206 requires habeas\ncorpus petitioners to exhaust administrative remedies in order to avoid dismissal. Accordingly,\nthe district court did not address those claims.       We will not address the issues for which\nadministrative remedies were not exhausted. The remaining issues are addressed above. Gray is\nnot entitled to relief regarding alleged differences between segregation and protective custody\nconditions.\n                                                III.\n                                         CONCLUSION\n        The district court did not abuse its discretion in summarily dismissing Gray’s petition for\nwrit of habeas corpus relief. Thus, we affirm the summary dismissal of Gray’s habeas corpus\npetition.\n        Judge GUTIERREZ and Judge MELANSON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f</pre>",
