Reiss, for appellant.\n\n      Alexander R. Boler (Tallahassee), for appellee.\n\nBefore SUAREZ, C.J., and LAGOA and LOGUE, JJ.\n\n      LOGUE, J.\n\n      The Estate of Betsy Gladis Hernandez appeals an order allocating a portion\n\nof proceeds from a wrongful death settlement to pay the Medicaid lien held by the\n\fAgency for Health Care Administration. The trial court apportioned the settlement\n\namount based on the formula in Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act. See\n\n§ 409.910(11)(f), Fla. Stat. (2012). We affirm.\n\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      In 2010, Ms. Hernandez died from complications from a rare condition. She\n\nwas survived by her husband and child. Her death was allegedly caused by Baptist\n\nHospital physicians’ misdiagnosis and treatment of her condition. Prior to the\n\nEstate filing suit, Baptist Hospital agreed to settle any wrongful death claims\n\nagainst it for $700,000. It is undisputed that the written settlement agreement did\n\nnot apportion the monies between the Estate and survivors.1\n\n      Due to Florida’s participation in the Medicaid program, the Agency had paid\n\n$409,676.36 of Ms. Hernandez’s medical expenses. These payments resulted in an\n\nautomatic lien on “collateral” for medical expenses paid on Ms. Hernandez’s\n\nbehalf. See § 409.910(6)(c), Fla. Stat. “Collateral” includes wrongful death\n\nsettlements. See §§ 409.910(6)(c) & 409.901(7)(b), Fla. Stat. (2012).\n\n      In 2012, the Estate filed a petition in probate court to determine the\n\nAgency’s lien. The petition requested that of the $700,000 settlement amount,\n\n$500,000 be apportioned to cover the survivors’ wrongful death statutory damages.\n\n\n1 The written settlement agreement does not appear in the record, but the Estate\nadmitted to the trial court that the agreement “made no reference to what type of\ndamages the $700,000 represented.”\n\n                                         2\n\fThe remaining $200,000 would be apportioned for the Medicaid lien and other\n\neconomic damages incurred by the Estate, including attorney’s fees. In response,\n\nthe Agency argued that, under the formula in Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party\n\nLiability Act, it was entitled to $262,500 prior to any wrongful death\n\napportionment. See § 409.910(11)(f). The Estate disagreed. Citing to Arkansas\n\nDepartment of Health & Human Services v. Ahlborn, 547 U.S. 268 (2006), it\n\ncontended that the federal Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396p(a)(1), preempts Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act. The Estate\n\nexplained that the Agency sought monies allocated to the survivors and that, under\n\nAhlborn’s interpretation of the anti-lien provision, the provision bars states from\n\nasserting a lien on the portions of a settlement not allocated to medical expenses.\n\n      Prior to any ruling on the petition, the United States Supreme Court issued\n\nits decision in Wos v. E.M.A., 133 S. Ct. 1391 (2013). The Estate then moved for\n\nan evidentiary hearing, arguing that Wos required an evidentiary hearing to\n\ndetermine what portion of the settlement qualifies as medical expenses. The\n\nAgency disagreed and argued that Ahlborn and Wos are inapplicable where the\n\nMedicaid recipient is deceased. Thus, the Agency reasoned that an evidentiary\n\nhearing was unnecessary because the petition turned on a straightforward\n\napplication of the formula in Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f         The trial court ultimately agreed with the Agency and denied the Estate’s\n\nmotion for an evidentiary hearing. It entered an order requiring the Estate to\n\nreimburse the Agency $262,500 from the $700,000 wrongful death settlement. The\n\nEstate moved for rehearing, which was denied, and then filed its notice of appeal in\n\nthis court. The Florida Supreme Court subsequently issued its opinion in Garcon v.\n\nFlorida Agency for Health Care Administration, 150 So. 3d 1101 (Fla. 2014),\n\nessentially recognizing that Florida courts must apply Wos.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n         The Estate argues that the trial court erred in one of two ways. First, citing to\n\nAhlborn, Wos, and Garcon, the Estate contends that Florida’s Medicaid Third-\n\nParty Liability Act is preempted by federal law which requires an evidentiary\n\nhearing to determine what portion of the settlement qualifies as medical expenses.\n\nIn the alternative, the Estate argues that an evidentiary hearing is necessary\n\nbecause Florida’s Wrongful Death Act prohibits the Agency from asserting a\n\nMedicaid lien on the portions of the settlement allocated to Ms. Hernandez’s\n\nsurvivors. We will address each issue in turn.2\n\n    I.      No Federal Preemption\n\n\n2 Both issues are questions of law reviewed de novo. See Vreeland v. Ferrer, 71 So.\n3d 70, 73 (Fla. 2011) (“Whether state law is preempted by federal law is a pure\nquestion of law that is subject to de novo review.”); Borden v. E.-European Ins.\nCo., 921 So. 2d 587, 591 (Fla. 2006) (“This issue involves a question of statutory\ninterpretation and thus is subject to de novo review.”).\n\n                                             4\n\f      The first issue involves the interplay between Florida and federal law. In\n\n1965, Congress created the Medicaid program to provide joint federal and state\n\nfunding of medical care for individuals who cannot afford to pay their own\n\nmedical costs. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. State participation in the program is\n\nvoluntary. However, once a state elects to participate, like Florida, the state must\n\ncomply with certain requirements imposed by federal Medicaid statutes. Pub.\n\nHealth Trust of Dade Cty., Fla. v. Dade Cty. Sch. Bd., 693 So. 2d 562, 564 (Fla. 3d\n\nDCA 1996).\n\n      In the early years of the program, Congress adopted the anti-lien provision.\n\nIt provides:\n\n      (a) Imposition of lien against property of an individual on account of\n          medical assistance rendered to him under a State plan\n\n      (1) No lien may be imposed against the property of any individual\n          prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be\n          paid on his behalf under the State plan, except-\n\n      (A) pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits\n          incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual, or\n\n      (B) in the case of the real property of an individual-[who is in a\n          nursing home and required by law to spend his own income on\n          those expenses, and who cannot reasonably be expected to return\n          home.]\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396p(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n      The Medicaid program is a cooperative one. The Federal Government pays\n\nbetween 50% and 83% of the costs a state incurs for patient care. Ahlborn, 547\n\n\n                                         5\n\fU.S. at 275. “[I]n return, the State pays its portion of the costs and complies with\n\ncertain statutory requirements for making eligibility determinations, collecting and\n\nmaintaining information, and administering the program.” Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a). One such requirement is that each participating state “implement a ‘third\n\nparty liability’ provision which requires the state to seek reimbursement for\n\nMedicaid expenditures from third parties who are liable for medical treatment\n\nprovided to a Medicaid recipient.” Roberts v. Albertson’s Inc., 119 So. 3d 457, 459\n\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citing § 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)).\n\n      To comply with this federal mandate, Florida enacted the Medicaid Third-\n\nParty Liability Act. It provides the Agency with three ways to recover expenses\n\nfrom third parties: (1) automatic subrogation to any rights of a Medicaid recipient\n\nto third-party benefits; (2) automatic assignment of the recipient’s rights to any\n\nthird-party benefits; or (3) automatic lien on “collateral.” § 409.910(6)(a)-(c), Fla.\n\nStat. “Collateral” and “third-party benefits” include “[a]ll judgments, settlements\n\nand settlement agreements rendered or entered into and related to such causes of\n\naction [related to a covered injury necessitating Medicaid payments].” §\n\n409.901(7)(b) & (28), Fla. Stat.\n\n      Although the entire amount of any settlement may be subject to a Medicaid\n\nlien, the amount of recovery is limited by the amount of Medicaid assistance\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fprovided. § 409.910(11)(e), Fla. Stat. It is also limited by a statutory formula. §\n\n409.910(11)(f), Fla. Stat.\n\n      A body of law has developed which further limits the Agency’s ability to\n\nassert a lien on portions of settlements. In Ahlborn, a case arising out of a personal\n\ninjury lawsuit, the federal Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision preempted a state law\n\nwhich automatically imposed a lien on tort settlement proceeds obtained by the\n\nMedicaid recipient. In that case, the settlement apportioned the recovery between\n\nmedical and non-medical expenses. The United States Supreme Court held that the\n\nanti-lien provision barred the state from asserting a lien on the portions of the\n\nsettlement not allocated to medical expenses. Ahlborn 547 U.S. at 284.\n\n      In Wos, the Court went a step further in a case arising out of a medical\n\nmalpractice settlement which did not divide the recovery between medical and\n\nnon-medical expenses. The Court analyzed a state statute which could be\n\ninterpreted as creating a conclusive presumption that one-third of a Medicaid\n\nbeneficiary’s tort recovery represented compensation for medical expenses. To the\n\nextent the statute created such a presumption, it was preempted by the Medicaid\n\nAct’s anti-lien provision. The Court held that the Medicaid beneficiary must be\n\nprovided with an opportunity to show that the parties to the settlement apportioned\n\nan amount for medical expenses that was less than the amount of the Medicaid\n\nlien. Wos, 133 S. Ct. at 1402.3\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      Recently, the Florida Supreme Court issued an opinion which essentially\n\nrecognized that Florida courts must apply Wos. Garcon, 150 So. 3d at 1102\n\n(vacating a decision and remanding the case for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith Wos). However, the Ahlborn, Wos, and Garcon decisions arose in the context\n\nof a living Medicaid recipient.\n\n      The issue of whether these decisions apply in the context of a deceased\n\nMedicaid recipient appears to be an issue of first impression in this state. In Austin\n\nv. Capital City Bank, No. 111,894, 2015 WL 4366519 (Kan. Ct. App. June 26,\n\n2015), however, the Court of Appeals of Kansas addressed a post-Wos case where\n\na state agency sought to recover Medicaid payments from a special needs trust\n\nafter the Medicaid recipient had died. There, a medical malpractice suit was filed\n\non behalf of a child who had suffered permanent disabilities. The suit was\n\nultimately settled. Under the terms of the settlement, a special needs trust was\n\ncreated which was designed to allow the child to keep the settlement funds and\n\nremain eligible to receive medical assistance through Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n\n3 In response to Wos, the Florida legislature amended the Medicaid Third-Party\nLiability Act. § 409.910(17)(b), Fla. Stat. (2013). It now provides Medicaid\nbeneficiaries with the opportunity to rebut the Act’s statutory formula. Id. In this\ncase, the settlement was reached before the 2013 amendment took effect. Cf.\nSuarez v. Port Charlotte HMA, LLC, 171 So. 3d 740, 742 (Fla. 2d DCA 2015)\n(holding that the 2013 amendment applied because the settlement was reached\nafter the amendment took effect). Neither the Estate nor the Agency raised any\nissue regarding the amendment’s application here. We therefore decline to reach\nthe issue.\n\n                                          8\n\f1396p(d)(4)(A) (2012). The child was the trust’s primary beneficiary, her mother\n\nwas the remainder beneficiary, and a bank was named trustee. After the child\n\npassed away, the bank eventually stopped making payments from the trust to the\n\nmother. Id. at *1. The mother then filed suit and named the state as a necessary\n\nparty. Among other points, she argued that Ahlborn and Wos represent rules of\n\ngeneral applicability for all Medicaid recipients. Id. at *4. Because the trust had no\n\ndesignation for medical care expenses, the mother contended that the state was not\n\nentitled to recover Medicaid payments from assets in the trust. Id. at *3.\n\n       The Austin court disagreed and concluded that the mother’s reliance on\n\nAhlborn and Wos was misplaced. It cogently explained why those decisions do not\n\nrepresent rules of general applicability for all Medicaid recipients:\n\n       In those cases, the [United States Supreme] Court considered the anti-\n       lien provision of the federal Medicaid statute, which states, in relevant\n       part, that “[n]o lien may be imposed against the property of any\n       individual prior to his [or her ] death on account of medical assistance\n       paid or to be paid on his [or her] behalf under the State plan.”\n       (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. § 1396p(a)(1). The plain language of 42\n       U.S.C. § 1396p(a)(1) clearly reflects Congress’ intent that the anti-lien\n       provision apply only to living Medicaid recipients.\n\nId. at *4.\n\n       We agree with Austin and find this authority to be persuasive. By its express\n\nterms, the Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision does not apply to a Medicaid lien\n\nimposed against the property of a Medicaid recipient after her death. We cannot\n\nignore the plain meaning of this provision. As our Supreme Court has repeatedly\n\n\n                                          9\n\fstated, “[i]f the language of the statute is clear and unequivocal, then the legislative\n\nintent must be derived from the words used without involving incidental rules of\n\nconstruction or engaging in speculation as to what the judges might think that the\n\nlegislators intended or should have intended.” Hess v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,\n\n175 So. 3d 687, 692 (Fla. 2015) (citation omitted). Thus, we hold that the federal\n\nMedicaid Act’s anti-lien provision does not preempt Florida’s Medicaid Third-\n\nParty Liability Act where a Medicaid lien is imposed on a wrongful death\n\nsettlement.\n\n   II.      Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act and Wrongful Death\n            Act\n\n         The second issue on appeal involves the interplay between Florida’s\n\nMedicaid Third-Party Liability Act and Wrongful Death Act. As noted above, the\n\nMedicaid Third-Party Liability Act governs the Agency’s right to recover\n\npayments made for medical expenses and provides the Agency with several ways\n\nto recover expenses from third parties. Regarding subrogation, the Act specifically\n\nprovides:\n\n         The agency is automatically subrogated to any rights that an applicant,\n         recipient, or legal representative has to any third-party benefit for the\n         full amount of medical assistance provided by Medicaid. Recovery\n         pursuant to the subrogation rights created hereby shall not be reduced,\n         prorated, or applied to only a portion of a judgment, award, or\n         settlement, but is to provide full recovery by the agency from any and\n         all third-party benefits. Equities of a recipient, his or her legal\n         representative, a recipient’s creditors, or health care providers shall\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f      not defeat, reduce, or prorate recovery by the agency as to its\n      subrogation rights granted under this paragraph.\n\n§ 409.910(6)(a), Fla. Stat. (emphasis added).\n\n      The legislative intent behind this Act is clear. Medicaid is to be repaid prior\n\nto any other person, program, or entity:\n\n      It is the intent of the Legislature that Medicaid be the payor of last\n      resort for medically necessary goods and services furnished to\n      Medicaid recipients. All other sources of payment for medical care are\n      primary to medical assistance provided by Medicaid. If benefits of a\n      liable third party are discovered or become available after medical\n      assistance has been provided by Medicaid, it is the intent of the\n      Legislature that Medicaid be repaid in full and prior to any other\n      person, program, or entity. Medicaid is to be repaid in full from, and\n      to the extent of, any third-party benefits, regardless of whether a\n      recipient is made whole or other creditors paid. Principles of common\n      law and equity as to assignment, lien, and subrogation are abrogated\n      to the extent necessary to ensure full recovery by Medicaid from\n      third-party resources. It is intended that if the resources of a liable\n      third party become available at any time, the public treasury should\n      not bear the burden of medical assistance to the extent of such\n      resources.\n\n§ 409.910(1), Fla. Stat. (emphasis added). This language reflects the legislature’s\n\ninterest in providing options to fund medical assistance it has deemed important to\n\npublic welfare.\n\n      When interpreting the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act, the Florida\n\nSupreme Court has warned the judicial branch to “be cautious when evaluating the\n\nchoices made by the legislative branch as to the appropriate funding for programs\n\nit has deemed important to the public welfare. We must avoid unnecessarily\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\flimiting the funding options available to the legislature when addressing today’s\n\npolicy problems.” Agency for Health Care Admin. v. Associated Indus. of Fla.,\n\nInc., 678 So. 2d 1239, 1243 (Fla. 1996) (determining the constitutionality of the\n\nAct). This recognition may appear prescient. With Medicaid costs and qualified\n\nindividuals on the rise, the interest in protecting Florida’s ability to recover funds\n\nto maintain this source of public benefits has also undoubtedly increased.\n\n      Against this backdrop, the Wrongful Death Act allows a decedent’s personal\n\nrepresentative to bring a single action against negligent parties to recover damages\n\nfor the decedent’s survivors and estate. See § 768.21, Fla. Stat. (2012); Cont’l\n\nNat’l Bank v. Brill, 636 So. 2d 782, 784 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994). It is silent on the\n\nmatter of Medicaid liens. It contemplates, however, that the damages recovered by\n\nthe decedent’s survivors are distinct from the damages recovered by the decedent’s\n\nestate. See § 768.21, Fla. Stat.; S. Shore Hosp. v. Easton, 441 So. 2d 161, 163 (Fla.\n\n3d DCA 1983). For this reason, one line of cases has held that certain statutory\n\nliens do not attach to wrongful death settlement proceeds attributable to survivors’\n\nclaims. See, e.g., Hartford Ins. Co. v. Goff, 4 So. 3d 770 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009)\n\n(workers’ compensation lien).\n\n      However, another line of cases has allowed Medicaid liens to attach to\n\nwrongful death settlement funds which may be attributable to the survivors’\n\nclaims. The key distinction between the two lines of cases is the plain meaning of\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fthe Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act. Unlike the statutes giving rise to the liens\n\nin Goff and other similar cases, the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act’s\n\nprovisions require that the Agency’s lien has priority. See § 409.910(1) & (6), Fla.\n\nStat.\n\n        For example, in Strafford v. Agency for Health Care Administration, 915\n\nSo. 2d 643 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005), and Englich v. Agency for Healthcare\n\nAdministration, 916 So. 2d 994 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005), the Second and Fourth\n\nDistricts held, respectively, that a Medicaid lien must be satisfied in accordance\n\nwith the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act prior to apportioning a wrongful death\n\nsettlement between the decedent’s estate and survivors. In both cases, the estate’s\n\npersonal representative sought to allocate portions of a wrongful death settlement\n\nbetween the survivors and the Agency without fully satisfying the Agency’s\n\nMedicaid lien. Both courts rejected the personal representative’s arguments by\n\nrelying on the plain language of the Act, such as the provisions discussing\n\nsubrogation and requiring Medicaid to be repaid prior to any other person,\n\nprogram, or entity. Strafford, 915 So. 2d at 646 (“Admittedly, the settlement in this\n\ncase occurred in the context of a wrongful death action in which the recoverable\n\ndamages for the survivors and the decedent’s estate are distinct . . . .

Agency for Health Care Administration, 947 So. 2d 457 (Fla. 3d\n\nDCA 2006), this court expressly adopted the reasoning of Strafford and Englich.\n\nLike Englich and Strafford, Ross involved an estate’s personal representative\n\nseeking to allocate wrongful death settlement proceeds among the survivors and\n\nthe Agency without fully satisfying the Agency’s lien. This court held that the\n\nAgency must be paid in accordance with the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act:\n\n      Contrary to the personal representative’s contention, she does not\n      have the right to allocate the settlement funds in such a manner that\n      the Agency receives less than the full amount of its expenditures for\n      medical assistance. Strafford v. Agency for Health Care Admin., 915\n      So.2d 643 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005) (“Following a settlement, the court is\n      required to segregate an amount sufficient to repay the Agency's\n      expenditures for medical assistance and shall order this amount to be\n      paid directly to the Agency.”).

The trial court apportioned the settlement\n\namount based on the formula in Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act. See\n\n§ 409.910(11)(f), Fla. Stat. (2012). We affirm.\n\n                   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      In 2010, Ms. Hernandez died from complications from a rare condition. She\n\nwas survived by her husband and child. Her death was allegedly caused by Baptist\n\nHospital physicians’ misdiagnosis and treatment of her condition. Prior to the\n\nEstate filing suit, Baptist Hospital agreed to settle any wrongful death claims\n\nagainst it for $700,000. It is undisputed that the written settlement agreement did\n\nnot apportion the monies between the Estate and survivors.1\n\n      Due to Florida’s participation in the Medicaid program, the Agency had paid\n\n$409,676.36 of Ms. Hernandez’s medical expenses. These payments resulted in an\n\nautomatic lien on “collateral” for medical expenses paid on Ms. Hernandez’s\n\nbehalf. See § 409.910(6)(c), Fla. Stat. “Collateral” includes wrongful death\n\nsettlements. See §§ 409.910(6)(c) & 409.901(7)(b), Fla. Stat. (2012).\n\n      In 2012, the Estate filed a petition in probate court to determine the\n\nAgency’s lien. The petition requested that of the $700,000 settlement amount,\n\n$500,000 be apportioned to cover the survivors’ wrongful death statutory damages.\n\n\n1 The written settlement agreement does not appear in the record, but the Estate\nadmitted to the trial court that the agreement “made no reference to what type of\ndamages the $700,000 represented.”\n\n                                         2\n\fThe remaining $200,000 would be apportioned for the Medicaid lien and other\n\neconomic damages incurred by the Estate, including attorney’s fees. In response,\n\nthe Agency argued that, under the formula in Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party\n\nLiability Act, it was entitled to $262,500 prior to any wrongful death\n\napportionment. See § 409.910(11)(f). The Estate disagreed. Citing to Arkansas\n\nDepartment of Health & Human Services v. Ahlborn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145661\"><a href=\"/opinion/145661/arkansas-dept-of-health-and-human-servs-v-ahlborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006), it\n\ncontended that the federal Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396p(a)(1), preempts Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act. The Estate\n\nexplained that the Agency sought monies allocated to the survivors and that, under\n\nAhlborn’s interpretation of the anti-lien provision, the provision bars states from\n\nasserting a lien on the portions of a settlement not allocated to medical expenses.\n\n      Prior to any ruling on the petition, the United States Supreme Court issued\n\nits decision in Wos v. E.M.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"855660\"><a href=\"/opinion/855660/wos-v-e-m-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Estate then moved for\n\nan evidentiary hearing, arguing that Wos required an evidentiary hearing to\n\ndetermine what portion of the settlement qualifies as medical expenses. The\n\nAgency disagreed and argued that Ahlborn and Wos are inapplicable where the\n\nMedicaid recipient is deceased. Thus, the Agency reasoned that an evidentiary\n\nhearing was unnecessary because the petition turned on a straightforward\n\napplication of the formula in Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f         The trial court ultimately agreed with the Agency and denied the Estate’s\n\nmotion for an evidentiary hearing. It entered an order requiring the Estate to\n\nreimburse the Agency $262,500 from the $700,000 wrongful death settlement. The\n\nEstate moved for rehearing, which was denied, and then filed its notice of appeal in\n\nthis court. The Florida Supreme Court subsequently issued its opinion in Garcon v.\n\nFlorida Agency for Health Care Administration, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2014),\n\nessentially recognizing that Florida courts must apply Wos.\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n         The Estate argues that the trial court erred in one of two ways. First, citing to\n\nAhlborn, Wos, and Garcon, the Estate contends that Florida’s Medicaid Third-\n\nParty Liability Act is preempted by federal law which requires an evidentiary\n\nhearing to determine what portion of the settlement qualifies as medical expenses.\n\nIn the alternative, the Estate argues that an evidentiary hearing is necessary\n\nbecause Florida’s Wrongful Death Act prohibits the Agency from asserting a\n\nMedicaid lien on the portions of the settlement allocated to Ms. Hernandez’s\n\nsurvivors.

In\n\n1965, Congress created the Medicaid program to provide joint federal and state\n\nfunding of medical care for individuals who cannot afford to pay their own\n\nmedical costs. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq. State participation in the program is\n\nvoluntary. However, once a state elects to participate, like Florida, the state must\n\ncomply with certain requirements imposed by federal Medicaid statutes. Pub.\n\nHealth Trust of Dade Cty., Fla. v. Dade Cty. Sch. Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1136083\"><a href=\"/opinion/1136083/public-health-trust-v-dade-cty-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">693</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 564 (Fla. 3d\n\nDCA 1996).\n\n      In the early years of the program, Congress adopted the anti-lien provision.\n\nIt provides:\n\n      (a) Imposition of lien against property of an individual on account of\n          medical assistance rendered to him under a State plan\n\n      (1) No lien may be imposed against the property of any individual\n          prior to his death on account of medical assistance paid or to be\n          paid on his behalf under the State plan, except-\n\n      (A) pursuant to the judgment of a court on account of benefits\n          incorrectly paid on behalf of such individual, or\n\n      (B) in the case of the real property of an individual-[who is in a\n          nursing home and required by law to spend his own income on\n          those expenses, and who cannot reasonably be expected to return\n          home.]\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1396p(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n\n      The Medicaid program is a cooperative one. The Federal Government pays\n\nbetween 50% and 83% of the costs a state incurs for patient care. Ahlborn, 547\n\n\n                                         5\n\fU.S. at 275. “[I]n return, the State pays its portion of the costs and complies with\n\ncertain statutory requirements for making eligibility determinations, collecting and\n\nmaintaining information, and administering the program.” Id. (citing 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1396a). One such requirement is that each participating state “implement a ‘third\n\nparty liability’ provision which requires the state to seek reimbursement for\n\nMedicaid expenditures from third parties who are liable for medical treatment\n\nprovided to a Medicaid recipient.” Roberts v. Albertson’s Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 459\n\n(Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citing § 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)).\n\n      To comply with this federal mandate, Florida enacted the Medicaid Third-\n\nParty Liability Act. It provides the Agency with three ways to recover expenses\n\nfrom third parties: (1) automatic subrogation to any rights of a Medicaid recipient\n\nto third-party benefits; (2) automatic assignment of the recipient’s rights to any\n\nthird-party benefits; or (3) automatic lien on “collateral.” § 409.910(6)(a)-(c), Fla.\n\nStat. “Collateral” and “third-party benefits” include “[a]ll judgments, settlements\n\nand settlement agreements rendered or entered into and related to such causes of\n\naction [related to a covered injury necessitating Medicaid payments].” §\n\n409.901(7)(b) & (28), Fla. Stat.\n\n      Although the entire amount of any settlement may be subject to a Medicaid\n\nlien, the amount of recovery is limited by the amount of Medicaid assistance\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fprovided. § 409.910(11)(e), Fla. Stat. It is also limited by a statutory formula. §\n\n409.910(11)(f), Fla. Stat.\n\n      A body of law has developed which further limits the Agency’s ability to\n\nassert a lien on portions of settlements. In Ahlborn, a case arising out of a personal\n\ninjury lawsuit, the federal Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision preempted a state law\n\nwhich automatically imposed a lien on tort settlement proceeds obtained by the\n\nMedicaid recipient. In that case, the settlement apportioned the recovery between\n\nmedical and non-medical expenses. The United States Supreme Court held that the\n\nanti-lien provision barred the state from asserting a lien on the portions of the\n\nsettlement not allocated to medical expenses. Ahlborn 547 U.S. at 284.\n\n      In Wos, the Court went a step further in a case arising out of a medical\n\nmalpractice settlement which did not divide the recovery between medical and\n\nnon-medical expenses. The Court analyzed a state statute which could be\n\ninterpreted as creating a conclusive presumption that one-third of a Medicaid\n\nbeneficiary’s tort recovery represented compensation for medical expenses. To the\n\nextent the statute created such a presumption, it was preempted by the Medicaid\n\nAct’s anti-lien provision. The Court held that the Medicaid beneficiary must be\n\nprovided with an opportunity to show that the parties to the settlement apportioned\n\nan amount for medical expenses that was less than the amount of the Medicaid\n\nlien. Wos, 133 S. Ct. at 1402.3\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\f      Recently, the Florida Supreme Court issued an opinion which essentially\n\nrecognized that Florida courts must apply Wos. Garcon, 150 So. 3d at 1102\n\n(vacating a decision and remanding the case for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith Wos). However, the Ahlborn, Wos, and Garcon decisions arose in the context\n\nof a living Medicaid recipient.\n\n      The issue of whether these decisions apply in the context of a deceased\n\nMedicaid recipient appears to be an issue of first impression in this state. In Austin\n\nv. Capital City Bank, No. 111,894, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4366519</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Kan. Ct. App. June 26,\n\n2015), however, the Court of Appeals of Kansas addressed a post-Wos case where\n\na state agency sought to recover Medicaid payments from a special needs trust\n\nafter the Medicaid recipient had died. There, a medical malpractice suit was filed\n\non behalf of a child who had suffered permanent disabilities. The suit was\n\nultimately settled. Under the terms of the settlement, a special needs trust was\n\ncreated which was designed to allow the child to keep the settlement funds and\n\nremain eligible to receive medical assistance through Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. §\n\n\n3 In response to Wos, the Florida legislature amended the Medicaid Third-Party\nLiability Act. § 409.910(17)(b), Fla. Stat. (2013). It now provides Medicaid\nbeneficiaries with the opportunity to rebut the Act’s statutory formula. Id. In this\ncase, the settlement was reached before the 2013 amendment took effect. Cf.\nSuarez v. Port Charlotte HMA, LLC, 1</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2487056\"><a href=\"/opinion/2487056/vreeland-v-ferrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 740, 742 (Fla. 2d DCA 2015)\n(holding that the 2013 amendment applied because the settlement was reached\nafter the amendment took effect). Neither the Estate nor the Agency raised any\nissue regarding the amendment’s application here. We therefore decline to reach\nthe issue.\n\n                                          8\n\f1396p(d)(4)(A) (2012). The child was the trust’s primary beneficiary, her mother\n\nwas the remainder beneficiary, and a bank was named trustee. After the child\n\npassed away, the bank eventually stopped making payments from the trust to the\n\nmother. Id. at *1. The mother then filed suit and named the state as a necessary\n\nparty. Among other points, she argued that Ahlborn and Wos represent rules of\n\ngeneral applicability for all Medicaid recipients. Id. at *4. Because the trust had no\n\ndesignation for medical care expenses, the mother contended that the state was not\n\nentitled to recover Medicaid payments from assets in the trust. Id. at *3.\n\n       The Austin court disagreed and concluded that the mother’s reliance on\n\nAhlborn and Wos was misplaced. It cogently explained why those decisions do not\n\nrepresent rules of general applicability for all Medicaid recipients:\n\n       In those cases, the [United States Supreme] Court considered the anti-\n       lien provision of the federal Medicaid statute, which states, in relevant\n       part, that “[n]o lien may be imposed against the property of any\n       individual prior to his [or her ] death on account of medical assistance\n       paid or to be paid on his [or her] behalf under the State plan.”\n       (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. § 1396p(a)(1). The plain language of 42\n       U.S.C. § 1396p(a)(1) clearly reflects Congress’ intent that the anti-lien\n       provision apply only to living Medicaid recipients.\n\nId. at *4.\n\n       We agree with Austin and find this authority to be persuasive. By its express\n\nterms, the Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision does not apply to a Medicaid lien\n\nimposed against the property of a Medicaid recipient after her death. We cannot\n\nignore the plain meaning of this provision. As our Supreme Court has repeatedly\n\n\n                                          9\n\fstated, “[i]f the language of the statute is clear and unequivocal, then the legislative\n\nintent must be derived from the words used without involving incidental rules of\n\nconstruction or engaging in speculation as to what the judges might think that the\n\nlegislators intended or should have intended.” Hess v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 692 (Fla. 2015) (citation omitted). Thus, we hold that the federal\n\nMedicaid Act’s anti-lien provision does not preempt Florida’s Medicaid Third-\n\nParty Liability Act where a Medicaid lien is imposed on a wrongful death\n\nsettlement.\n\n   II.      Florida’s Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act and Wrongful Death\n            Act\n\n         The second issue on appeal involves the interplay between Florida’s\n\nMedicaid Third-Party Liability Act and Wrongful Death Act. As noted above, the\n\nMedicaid Third-Party Liability Act governs the Agency’s right to recover\n\npayments made for medical expenses and provides the Agency with several ways\n\nto recover expenses from third parties. Regarding subrogation, the Act specifically\n\nprovides:\n\n         The agency is automatically subrogated to any rights that an applicant,\n         recipient, or legal representative has to any third-party benefit for the\n         full amount of medical assistance provided by Medicaid. Recovery\n         pursuant to the subrogation rights created hereby shall not be reduced,\n         prorated, or applied to only a portion of a judgment, award, or\n         settlement, but is to provide full recovery by the agency from any and\n         all third-party benefits. Equities of a recipient, his or her legal\n         representative, a recipient’s creditors, or health care providers shall\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f      not defeat, reduce, or prorate recovery by the agency as to its\n      subrogation rights granted under this paragraph.\n\n§ 409.910(6)(a), Fla. Stat. (emphasis added).\n\n      The legislative intent behind this Act is clear. Medicaid is to be repaid prior\n\nto any other person, program, or entity:\n\n      It is the intent of the Legislature that Medicaid be the payor of last\n      resort for medically necessary goods and services furnished to\n      Medicaid recipients. All other sources of payment for medical care are\n      primary to medical assistance provided by Medicaid. If benefits of a\n      liable third party are discovered or become available after medical\n      assistance has been provided by Medicaid, it is the intent of the\n      Legislature that Medicaid be repaid in full and prior to any other\n      person, program, or entity. Medicaid is to be repaid in full from, and\n      to the extent of, any third-party benefits, regardless of whether a\n      recipient is made whole or other creditors paid. Principles of common\n      law and equity as to assignment, lien, and subrogation are abrogated\n      to the extent necessary to ensure full recovery by Medicaid from\n      third-party resources. It is intended that if the resources of a liable\n      third party become available at any time, the public treasury should\n      not bear the burden of medical assistance to the extent of such\n      resources.\n\n§ 409.910(1), Fla. Stat. (emphasis added). This language reflects the legislature’s\n\ninterest in providing options to fund medical assistance it has deemed important to\n\npublic welfare.\n\n      When interpreting the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act, the Florida\n\nSupreme Court has warned the judicial branch to “be cautious when evaluating the\n\nchoices made by the legislative branch as to the appropriate funding for programs\n\nit has deemed important to the public welfare. We must avoid unnecessarily\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\flimiting the funding options available to the legislature when addressing today’s\n\npolicy problems.” Agency for Health Care Admin. v.

This recognition may appear prescient. With Medicaid costs and qualified\n\nindividuals on the rise, the interest in protecting Florida’s ability to recover funds\n\nto maintain this source of public benefits has also undoubtedly increased.\n\n      Against this backdrop, the Wrongful Death Act allows a decedent’s personal\n\nrepresentative to bring a single action against negligent parties to recover damages\n\nfor the decedent’s survivors and estate.

Brill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788298\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788298/continental-nat-bank-v-brill/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994). It is silent on the\n\nmatter of Medicaid liens. It contemplates, however, that the damages recovered by\n\nthe decedent’s survivors are distinct from the damages recovered by the decedent’s\n\nestate. See § 768.21, Fla. Stat.; S. Shore Hosp. v. Easton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163 (Fla.\n\n3d DCA 1983). For this reason, one line of cases has held that certain statutory\n\nliens do not attach to wrongful death settlement proceeds attributable to survivors’\n\nclaims. See, e.g., Hartford Ins. Co. v. Goff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1643453\"><a href=\"/opinion/1643453/hartford-ins-co-v-goff/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2d DCA 2009)\n\n(workers’ compensation lien).\n\n      However, another line of cases has allowed Medicaid liens to attach to\n\nwrongful death settlement funds which may be attributable to the survivors’\n\nclaims. The key distinction between the two lines of cases is the plain meaning of\n\n\n\n                                         12\n\fthe Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act. Unlike the statutes giving rise to the liens\n\nin Goff and other similar cases, the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act’s\n\nprovisions require that the Agency’s lien has priority. See § 409.910(1) & (6), Fla.\n\nStat.\n\n        For example, in Strafford v. Agency for Health Care Administration, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1712267\"><a href=\"/opinion/1712267/strafford-v-agency-for-health-care-admin/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2d DCA 2005), and Englich v. Agency for Healthcare\n\nAdministration, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1620994\"><a href=\"/opinion/1620994/englich-v-agency-for-healthcare-admin/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 4th DCA 2005), the Second and Fourth\n\nDistricts held, respectively, that a Medicaid lien must be satisfied in accordance\n\nwith the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act prior to apportioning a wrongful death\n\nsettlement between the decedent’s estate and survivors. In both cases, the estate’s\n\npersonal representative sought to allocate portions of a wrongful death settlement\n\nbetween the survivors and the Agency without fully satisfying the Agency’s\n\nMedicaid lien. Both courts rejected the personal representative’s arguments by\n\nrelying on the plain language of the Act, such as the provisions discussing\n\nsubrogation and requiring Medicaid to be repaid prior to any other person,\n\nprogram, or entity. Strafford, 915 So. 2d at 646 (“Admittedly, the settlement in this\n\ncase occurred in the context of a wrongful death action in which the recoverable\n\ndamages for the survivors and the decedent’s estate are distinct . . . . Even so, the\n\n[Medicaid Third-Party Liability] Act’s provisions require that the Agency be paid\n\nprior to any apportionment between the estate and the survivors.”); Englich, 916\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fSo. 2d at 997 (“Given the plain meaning of the statute, and the cases interpreting\n\nits provisions, the trial court correctly denied the plaintiff’s request to reduce the\n\nMedicaid lien proportionately to the amount the survivors’ recovery bore to their\n\ntotal claim.”).\n\n      In Ross v. Agency for Health Care Administration, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 3d\n\nDCA 2006), this court expressly adopted the reasoning of Strafford and Englich.\n\nLike Englich and Strafford, Ross involved an estate’s personal representative\n\nseeking to allocate wrongful death settlement proceeds among the survivors and\n\nthe Agency without fully satisfying the Agency’s lien. This court held that the\n\nAgency must be paid in accordance with the Medicaid Third-Party Liability Act:\n\n      Contrary to the personal representative’s contention, she does not\n      have the right to allocate the settlement funds in such a manner that\n      the Agency receives less than the full amount of its expenditures for\n      medical assistance. Strafford v. Agency for Health Care Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1712267\"><a href=\"/opinion/1712267/strafford-v-agency-for-health-care-admin/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span>\n      <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 2d DCA 2005) (“Following a settlement, the court is\n      required to segregate an amount sufficient to repay the Agency's\n      expenditures for medical assistance and shall order this amount to be\n      paid directly to the Agency.”). The Wrongful Death Act does not alter\n      this requirement. Englich v. Agency for Healthcare Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1620994\"><a href=\"/opinion/1620994/englich-v-agency-for-healthcare-admin/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span>\n      <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 4th DCA 2005).\n\nRoss, 947 So. 2d at 458. We are bound by that decision.\n\n      Contrary to the Estate’s contention, Ahlborn, Wos, and Garcon have not\n\nundermined Ross as authority. As explained above, Ahlborn, Wos, and Garcon are\n\ninapplicable here because the federal Medicaid Act’s anti-lien provision applies\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fonly to living Medicaid recipients. In cases where, as here, a Medicaid lien was\n\nimposed against a wrongful death settlement, Ross controls.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       15\n\f</pre>",
