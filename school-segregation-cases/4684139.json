Governmental Immunity. Commonwealth, Claim against,\n     Liability for tort. Negligence, Hospital, Proximate cause,\n     Governmental immunity. Proximate Cause.\n\n\n     Civil action commenced in the Superior Court Department on\nDecember 5, 2011.\n\n\n\n    1\n        A pseudonym.\n    2\n       This case was initially heard by a panel comprised of\nJustices Rubin, Maldonado, and Massing. After circulation of a\nmajority and dissenting opinion to the other justices of the\nAppeals Court, the panel was expanded to include Chief Justice\nKafker and Justice Cypher. Following the expansion of the\npanel, the court ordered a rehearing of the case before the\nexpanded panel. See Sciaba Constr. Corp. v. Boston, 35 Mass.\nApp. Ct. 181, 181 n.2 (1993).\n\n     Justice Cypher participated in the deliberation on this\ncase while an Associate Justice of the court, prior to her\nappointment as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial\nCourt.\n\f                                                                      2\n\n\n     The case was heard by Elizabeth M. Fahey, J., on a motion\nfor summary judgment.\n\n\n     John E. Zuccaro, III, for the plaintiff.\n     Anne M. McLaughlin, Assistant Attorney General, for the\nCommonwealth.\n\n\n     MALDONADO, J.    The plaintiff filed a complaint against the\n\nCommonwealth under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L.\n\nc. 258 (MTCA), alleging that, while she was committed to a\n\nlocked unit of Tewksbury State Hospital, a similarly committed\n\nmale patient raped her while she was watching television in a\n\nrecreation room that is shared by both the male and female\n\npatients of that unit.    The only issue before us is whether the\n\nhospital's failure to segregate by gender its patients' use of a\n\ncommon recreation room constitutes an \"original cause\" of the\n\nrape.    See G. L. c. 258, § 10(j).3   Concluding that it does not,\n\nwe affirm the summary judgment entered in favor of the\n\nCommonwealth.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       General Laws c. 258, § 10(j), inserted by St. 1993,\nc. 495, § 57, immunizes public employers from suit under the\nMTCA for\n\n     \"any claim based on an act or failure to act to prevent or\n     diminish the harmful consequences of a condition or\n     situation, including the violent or tortious conduct of a\n     third person, which is not originally caused by the public\n     employer or any other person acting on behalf of the public\n     employer.\"\n\f                                                                    3\n\n\n     Background.4   Tewksbury State Hospital evaluates and treats\n\npatients with varying degrees of mental illness.    The hospital's\n\nHathorne Unit is a locked unit that houses, on separate\n\ncorridors, both male and female patients.5   Male patients are not\n\npermitted access onto the female corridor, and female patients\n\nare not permitted access onto the male corridor, except that\n\npatients of both genders enjoy nearly free access to a common\n\nrecreation room.    The recreation room contains a ping-pong\n\ntable, some other games, and a television set; it also leads to\n\na common sunroom which offers a second television set for\n\npatient viewing.    The common rooms are not staffed or equipped\n\nwith video surveillance, but hospital staff conduct safety\n\nchecks in the rooms every thirty minutes.\n\n\n\n     4\n       We take the facts from the statement of material facts\nsubmitted in connection with the Commonwealth's summary judgment\nmotion. We view any factual disputes in the light most\nfavorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party. See Milliken\n& Co. v. Duro Textiles, LLC, 451 Mass. 547, 550 n.6 (2008);\nHarrison v. Mattapoisett, 78 Mass. App. Ct. 367, 370 (2010).\nThus, we credit the plaintiff's evidence that she was raped.\n     5\n       The summary judgment record is silent regarding what types\nof patients are assigned to the Hathorne Unit, how placement\ndecisions are made, who makes them, or who, other than the\nplaintiff and her assailant, was housed there. The record does\ninclude evidence that when a patient is admitted to the\nhospital, the Department of Mental Health's division of forensic\nmental health services conducts a check of the patient's\ncriminal background and queries the Sex Offender Registry Board\nto determine whether the patient is a registered sex offender or\nhas a history of sexual offenses.\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\n     In March, 2009, a District Court judge committed the\n\nplaintiff, who had been charged with an assault and battery, to\n\nthe hospital for a competency evaluation under G. L. c. 123,\n\n§ 15(b).6   She was assigned to the Hathorne Unit.   The plaintiff\n\nalleges that about three weeks into her commitment, she was\n\nwatching television in the sunroom when a male patient entered\n\nthe sunroom and forcibly raped her.7\n\n     Like the plaintiff, the male patient was also hospitalized\n\non a court-ordered mental health evaluation in connection with\n\nan open criminal charge.8   While the male patient had a criminal\n\nhistory that included convictions for assaultive behavior, a\n\nDepartment of Mental Health background check revealed that he\n\nwas not a registered sex offender and, further, that his\n\ncriminal history \"did not suggest that he posed any risk of\n\n\n\n\n     6\n       Under G. L. c. 123, § 15(b), as amended through St. 2000,\nc. 357, a judge in a criminal case may order a defendant to be\n\"hospitalized at a facility or, if such person is a male and\nappears to require strict security, at the Bridgewater state\nhospital . . . to determine whether mental illness or mental\ndefect have so affected a person that he is not competent to\nstand trial or not criminally responsible for the crime or\ncrimes with which he has been charged.\"\n     7\n       The rape resulted in a pregnancy, which subsequently\nresulted in a miscarriage.\n     8\n       There is no evidence that either the plaintiff or the male\npatient was held on bail.\n\f                                                                     5\n\n\ncommitting a sexual assault or other violent sex offending\n\nbehavior.\"9\n\n     In December, 2011, the plaintiff filed this tort action\n\nalleging that the Commonwealth's negligence caused the sexual\n\nassault, the unwanted pregnancy, and the subsequent miscarriage.\n\nThe Commonwealth moved for summary judgment on the ground that\n\nit was immune from suit under § 10(j) of the MTCA.    A judge of\n\nthe Superior Court allowed the motion and entered summary\n\njudgment for the Commonwealth.   This appeal followed.\n\n     Discussion.   Summary judgment is appropriate where \"all\n\nmaterial facts have been established and the moving party is\n\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"   Augat, Inc. v.\n\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co., 410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991).    \"In reviewing\n\na grant of summary judgment, 'we assess the record de novo and\n\ntake the facts, together with all reasonable inferences to be\n\ndrawn from them, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.'\"   Pugsley v. Police Dept. of Boston, 472 Mass. 367, 370-\n\n371 (2015), quoting from Bulwer v. Mount Auburn Hosp., 86 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 316, 318 (2014), S.C., 473 Mass. 672 (2016).    Here,\n\nwhere the Commonwealth is immune from suit for \"any claim based\n\non an act or failure to act to prevent or diminish the harmful\n\n\n     9\n       The plaintiff does not argue that the hospital was\nnegligent in its assessment of the male patient's risk of\nviolence.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\nconsequences of a condition or situation, including the violent\n\nor tortious conduct of a third person, which is not originally\n\ncaused by the public employer or any other person acting on\n\nbehalf of the public employer,\" the defendant bore the burden of\n\ndemonstrating the absence of a triable issue regarding whether\n\nthe plaintiff's rape and resulting pregnancy were \"originally\n\ncaused by the public employer\" (emphasis supplied).    G. L.\n\nc. 258, § 10(j).    Alternatively, it bore the burden of showing\n\nthat proof that the public employer \"committed an affirmative\n\nact that was the original cause of the injury\" would not be\n\nforthcoming.   Audette v. Commonwealth, 63 Mass. App. Ct. 727,\n\n732 (2005).    See Kourouvacilis v. General Motors Corp., 410\n\nMass. 706, 714 (1991) (\"[A] party who moves for summary judgment\n\nhas the burden of initially showing that there is an absence of\n\nevidence to support the case of the nonmoving party shouldering\n\nthe burden of proof at trial\").\n\n    In this context, \"originally caused\" means an affirmative\n\nact that creates the circumstance which results in the harm\n\ninflicted by the third party.    See Brum v. Dartmouth, 428 Mass.\n\n684, 693 (1999); Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 318\n\n(2002); Gennari v. Reading Pub. Schs., 77 Mass. App. Ct. 762,\n\n764 (2010).    The requirement of an \"affirmative act\" is strict;\n\nit is also quite distinct from a failure to prevent the harm.\n\nSee Kent v. Commonwealth, supra (where the court reiterated that\n\f                                                                       7\n\n\nthe \"original cause\" language had been construed \"to mean an\n\naffirmative act [not a failure to act] by a public employer that\n\ncreates the 'condition or situation' that results in harm\n\ninflicted by a third party\").    See also Brum v. Dartmouth, 428\n\nMass. at 696 (\"[T]o interpret . . . the subordinate clause\n\nreferring to 'originally caused' conditions, to include\n\nconditions that are, in effect, failures to prevent harm, would\n\nundermine that principal purpose [of § 10(j)]\").     The facts of\n\nthese two cases, and several others, demonstrate the significant\n\ndifference between the failure to act and an \"original cause.\"\n\n       In Brum, a school principal was told that three men were\n\ncoming to attack three particular students, but neither he nor\n\nany other school official instituted any precautionary measures\n\nto protect the students or to prevent the attackers' entry onto\n\nthe school premises.    Id. at 686-687.   The assailants arrived at\n\nthe school visibly armed, proceeded to a second-floor classroom\n\nunimpeded by school officials, and fatally stabbed one of the\n\nidentified students; his mother brought suit.     Id. at 687.     In\n\nthat case, the Supreme Judicial Court held that the principal's\n\nfailure to institute any safety precautions on behalf of the\n\nstudent was a failure to prevent the harm and not an affirmative\n\nact and, consequently, that it was not an original cause of the\n\ncondition or situation that lead to the student's death.        Id. at\n\n696.   This distinction between a failure to act and an original\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\ncause was further explored by this court in Jacome v.\n\nCommonwealth, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 489-490 (2002).\n\n    In Jacome, a teenager drowned at a public beach when\n\nlifeguards left their posts early.    Id. at 488.   Despite the\n\ndangerous bathing conditions, the beach remained open and no\n\nwarning signs had been posted.    The court held that, under\n\n§ 10(j), the Commonwealth's negligent failure to prevent the\n\nharm did not constitute an original cause of the swimmer's\n\ndrowning.   The court noted specifically that, \"[h]ad the public\n\nemployees acted differently, e.g., had the beach been closed,\n\nhad conspicuous warning signs been posted, had lifeguards\n\nremained on duty until 6:00 P.M., it is possible that the\n\ntragedy might have been averted.    But the very statement of\n\nthese possibilities demonstrates why th[e] claim is barred by\n\n§ 10(j).    They are all examples of ways in which the public\n\nemployees might have prevented the harm to [the deceased teenage\n\nswimmer], and consequently they fall within the immunity from\n\nsuit in such circumstances that the Legislature has preserved.\"\n\nId. at 490.\n\n    Similarly, in Pallazola v. Foxborough, 418 Mass. 639, 639-\n\n640 (1994), a man was seriously injured on a public way when he\n\nwas struck by a goal post that had become electrified when fans\n\nattending a sporting event removed the post and caused it to\n\ncome into contact with a high-voltage overhead electric power\n\f                                                                      9\n\n\nline.     Although the plaintiff recovered a jury award against the\n\ntown based upon the town's failure to provide sufficient police\n\nprotection and prevent the unlawful removal of the goal post\n\nfrom the stadium, the court held that § 10(j) barred the\n\nplaintiff's recovery and reversed the judgment.      Id. at 641-642.\n\nIn Serrell v. Franklin County, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 400 (1999), the\n\nplaintiff, a visitor at a house of correction, was inadvertently\n\ninjured after correctional officers intervened in a fight\n\nbetween an inmate and another visitor.      Id. at 400-401.   We held\n\nthat, \"[t]o the extent that [the plaintiff] seeks to hold the\n\ncounty liable for the correctional officers' failure to prevent\n\nthe violent outburst of [an] inmate . . . , Brum makes clear\n\nthat she may not do so.\"10    Id. at 403.\n\n     Here, the plaintiff alleges that by allowing access to the\n\nrecreation room to both males and females, the hospital is an\n\noriginal cause of her rape, pregnancy, and miscarriage.       While\n\nwe agree with the dissent that \"[t]he Commonwealth bears a\n\n\n     10\n       In Serrell, 47 Mass. App. Ct. at 401-403, 405, we also\nconcluded that § 10(b) and (j) precluded recovery under several\nof the plaintiff's theories, including the Commonwealth's\n\"failure to provide a safe area in which to visit an inmate;\n. . . failure properly to train, instruct and supervise\ncorrectional officers; [and] the correctional officers' failure\nto monitor the inmates in the visiting area and thereby control\nand ameliorate an increasingly volatile situation,\" but that\n§ 10(j) did not bar recovery based on a theory of negligent\nintervention, where the officers' own actions inadvertently\ncaused harm to the plaintiff.\n\f                                                                   10\n\n\nspecial responsibility for the safety and general well-being of\n\nthose who have been involuntarily committed to State psychiatric\n\nfacilities,\" post at   , we do not think it a fair inference\n\nthat by merely allowing both men and women access to a common\n\nrecreation room, the hospital was an original cause of the\n\nplaintiff's rape and, therefore, of the injuries, including the\n\nplaintiff's pregnancy and miscarriage, which flowed therefrom.\n\nSee, e.g., Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. at 319-320 (where the\n\nCommonwealth did not create the condition that resulted in the\n\nvictim's shooting by a parolee, § 10[j] barred suit).    Indeed,\n\nthe Supreme Judicial Court has refused to \"adopt an\n\ninterpretation of [§ 10(j)] that construes the words 'originally\n\ncaused' so broadly as to encompass the remotest causation and\n\npreclude immunity in nearly all circumstances.\"    Brum, 428 Mass.\n\nat 695.\n\n    In Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. at 313, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court addressed an analogous situation.   There, a\n\npolice officer was shot and seriously wounded by a convicted\n\nmurderer who had been paroled years earlier.   The officer argued\n\nthat the parole board's decision to parole his assailant was an\n\noriginal cause of his injury.   Id. at 318.   The court disagreed.\n\nIt reasoned that while \"[t]here can be little doubt that the\n\n[earlier] parole decision contributed in some measure to [the\n\nshooter's] freedom [years later], at least in the sense that the\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\nparole board released him from State confinement when he might\n\notherwise still be serving his life sentence,\" that act did not\n\n\"materially contribute[]\" to creating the specific condition or\n\nsituation that resulted in harm.   Id. at 318, 319.   The same is\n\ntrue here.\n\n    There can be no question that not every man is a rapist or\n\nat risk of a sexual offense, and it is undisputed that the\n\nhospital checks its patients' criminal and sexual offending\n\nhistory before admitting them, and that it did so in this case.\n\nThe hospital made a reasoned decision, which is not at issue\n\nhere, that the male patient posed no risk of sexual assault.\n\nThe male perpetrator also did not \"appear[] to require strict\n\nsecurity,\" as indicated by his not having been committed to the\n\nBridgewater State Hospital pursuant to G. L. c. 123, § 15(b),\n\nand the hospital here had no role in committing him to its care.\n\nSee, e.g., Brum v. Dartmouth, 428 Mass. at 689 (because the\n\ndecision to release a prisoner on bail rests with the court, the\n\nprosecutor's recommendation for release was too remote to serve\n\nas a source of liability for the prisoner's attack on another).\n\nFurthermore, hospital staff performed safety checks in the room\n\nevery thirty minutes, and nothing in the summary judgment record\n\nsupports an inference that the recreation room itself made the\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\noccurrence of a rape more foreseeable.11   Contrast Gennari v.\n\nReading Pub. Schs., 77 Mass. App. Ct. at 764-765 (that children\n\nwould run and push each other during a mandated recess session\n\nwas sufficiently foreseeable to overcome § 10[j] immunity, where\n\nschool principal chose an unsafe play area).    Under these\n\ncircumstances, the plaintiff's claim \"can be characterized only\n\nas failure to prevent the assailant from being in a position to\n\nattack the plaintiff,\" which is insufficient to overcome the\n\nimmunity that § 10(j) provides.    Brum v. Dartmouth, supra at\n\n695.\n\n       We have no doubt that \"[h]ad the public employees acted\n\ndifferently\" in this case by more closely monitoring the\n\nrecreation and sunroom \"it is possible the tragedy might have\n\nbeen averted.   But the very statement of these possibilities\n\ndemonstrates why this claim is barred by § 10(j).\"    Jacome v.\n\nCommonwealth, 56 Mass. App. Ct. at 490.    See Bonnie W. v.\n\nCommonwealth, 419 Mass. 122, 123, 126 (1994) (the Commonwealth\n\nwas not liable for a woman's rape on the basis of a parole\n\n\n\n\n       11\n       On this record, there can be no reasonable depiction of\nthe sunroom as a secluded area. The sunroom was adjacent to the\nrecreation room. It was open to all patients and monitored by\nstaff every one-half hour. We also reject any inference that\nthe rape occurred because the plaintiff was in a locked hospital\nunit wearing only a hospital gown, post at   .\n\f                                                                    13\n\n\nofficer's failure to supervise a sexual predator parolee).12\n\n\"[T]he principal purpose of § 10(j) is to preclude liability for\n\nfailures to prevent or diminish harm, including harm brought\n\nabout by the wrongful act of a third party.\"    Brum v. Dartmouth,\n\nsupra at 696.    Accordingly, we do not agree with the dissent\n\nthat the hospital's decision to not segregate by gender its\n\npatients' use of the recreation room caused the plaintiff to be\n\nraped by another individual.    Nor do we agree that the decision\n\nwe reach today runs afoul of our reasoning and decision in\n\nDevlin v. Commonwealth, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 530 (2013).\n\n       In Devlin, we concluded that a treatment center's decision\n\nto employ its prison population to work in a treatment facility\n\nin which it housed its civilly committed population was an\n\n\"original cause\" of the violent attack sustained by the\n\ntreatment center's patient.    In that case, the treatment center\n\nvoluntarily elected to employ convicted inmates serving criminal\n\nsentences to work at the location in which it housed its civilly\n\ncommitted population -- a choice that was explicitly forbidden\n\nby statute.    Id. at 533-534, citing G. L. c. 123, § 35, fourth\n\npar.    Here, the hospital made no analogous decision.   Unlike the\n\n\n       12\n       By contrast, in Bonnie W., unlike the situation here, the\nCommonwealth was liable for recommending a sexual offender for\nwork in a setting that gave him access to the victim's house\nkey. 419 Mass. at 126. Here, the hospital did not provide a\nknown sexual predator with access to the plaintiff.\n\f                                                                  14\n\n\nmanagement choice made in Devlin to comingle a dangerous prison\n\npopulation with a civilly-committed vulnerable population, the\n\nhospital here did not comingle two distinctly different\n\ncommitted populations.13   For all these reasons, therefore, we\n\n\n\n     13\n       In our view, the legislation referenced by the dissent,\nwhich requires segregation of male and female detainees, has no\nbearing on our case. First, the dissent has put forth no\nevidence that the policy decisions that led to these statutes\nconcerned a fear that the mere comingling of genders would\nresult in an increase in the number of rapes at these\ninstitutions. Second, it is noteworthy that each of these\nstatutes pertains to the segregation by gender of potentially\ndangerous detainees -- either because these individuals are\nimprisoned convicts, potentially dangerous substance abusers,\npersons held on bail, or persons awaiting arraignment whose\npotential for dangerousness has not yet been determined. See,\ne.g., G. L. c. 127, § 22 (\"Male and female prisoners shall not\nbe put or kept in the same room in a jail or house of\ncorrection\" [emphasis added]). See also G. L. c. 123, § 35\n(establishing separate commitment facilities for males and\nfemales found to be dangerous due to substance abuse disorders);\nG. L. c. 125, § 16, third par., inserted by St. 1989, c. 664,\n§ 1 (\"The department [of correction] shall maintain at the\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham, a separate\nawaiting trial unit for females\" on bail); G. L. c. 127, § 20\n(establishing separate reception centers for male and female\n\"prisoners\" [emphasis added]); G. L. c. 127, § 21 (permitting\nclassification of prisoners by gender \"to promote their . . .\nsafe custody . . . and to secure the separation of male and\nfemale prisoners\" [emphasis added]); G. L. c. 147, § 20 (if a\nfemale is arrested and detained at a police station, commanding\nofficer must summon matron attached to station or, if no matron\nis so attached, remove the female prisoner to the nearest\nstation with a matron).\n\n     The record in this case does not support an inference that\nthe mental health patients committed to the hospital for\nevaluation and placed on the Hathorne unit posed the same risks\nof dangerousness as those underlying the enactment of the\nstatutes referenced by the dissent. There is no evidence that\nthe plaintiff's assailant was being imprisoned to serve a\n\f                                                                  15\n\n\nconclude summary judgment properly entered for the Commonwealth\n\nhere.\n\n                                        Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nsentence, was being held on bail, or was potentially sexually\ndangerous.\n\f    MASSING, J. (dissenting, with whom Rubin, J., joins).      In\n\ngeneral, the Commonwealth is not liable under the Massachusetts\n\nTort Claims Act (MTCA) for torts committed by third parties,\n\neven third parties under the supervision of public employers or\n\ntheir employees.   Thus, the Commonwealth cannot be sued for the\n\nviolent acts of persons at liberty on parole, even though\n\nparolees are under the supervision of public employees and their\n\nconditional liberty is the result of the decision of public\n\nemployees.   See Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. 312, 319 (2002).\n\nNor is the Commonwealth generally liable for failing to prevent\n\nviolent acts committed by one inmate against another in a\n\nprison, house of correction, or jail.   Contrast Devlin v.\n\nCommonwealth, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 530, 535 (2013) (no exemption\n\nfrom liability where convicted inmates were allowed to work in\n\narea of State hospital where civilly committed persons were\n\nhoused and treated).   A narrow exception exists, however, when\n\nan act or decision of a public employer \"materially contributed\n\nto creating the specific 'condition or situation' that resulted\n\nin the harm.\"   Kent, supra at 319, quoting from G. L. c. 258,\n\n§ 10(j).   In my view, the Tewksbury State Hospital's decision to\n\nhouse both male and female committed patients in the same locked\n\nunit, and to allow the patients unsupervised access to the\n\ncommon room, is such an act.   Accordingly, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\f                                                                        2\n\n\n       By its terms, § 10(j) exempts the Commonwealth from\n\nliability for \"any claim based on an act or failure to act to\n\nprevent or diminish the harmful consequences of a condition or\n\nsituation, including the violent or tortious conduct of a third\n\nperson,\" unless it is \"originally caused by the public employer\n\nor any other person acting on behalf of the public employer.\"\n\nG. L. c. 258, § 10(j), inserted by St. 1993, c. 495, § 57.          I\n\nrecognize that this provision does not permit us to recast every\n\n\"failure to . . . prevent\" the \"conduct of a third person\" into\n\nan affirmative act of the public employer that \"originally\n\ncaused\" the \"condition or situation\" leading to the plaintiff's\n\ninjury, lest the exception swallow the rule.     See Brum v.\n\nDartmouth, 428 Mass. 684, 693 (1999).     \"What is needed is an\n\nexample of a condition leading to a harmful consequence, where\n\nthat condition was originally caused by the public employer but\n\nnot brought about by the public employer's failure to prevent\n\nit.\"    Ibid.   This case presents such an example.\n\n       I do not contend that the hospital was the sole cause of\n\nthe plaintiff's alleged rape, or that it can be liable solely\n\nfor failure to prevent the plaintiff's injury.        Rather, the\n\nhospital affirmatively acted to house in the same locked unit\n\nboth men and women who were committed for competency evaluations\n\nin connection with criminal charges, and to permit them to have\n\nunsupervised contact in a secluded common room.        This decision\n\f                                                                      3\n\n\nwas an \"original cause\" of the plaintiff's rape, pregnancy, and\n\nmiscarriage.   The hospital \"materially contributed to creating,\"\n\nand did not merely fail to prevent, the condition that resulted\n\nin the plaintiff's being attacked in the common room by an\n\ninvoluntarily committed male patient.\n\n    Devlin v. Commonwealth, 83 Mass. App. Ct. 530 (2013),\n\ngoverns the case before us.   In Devlin, the plaintiff had been\n\ncivilly committed under G. L. c. 123, § 35, to the Massachusetts\n\naddiction center at the Southeastern Correctional Center in\n\nBridgewater to be treated for alcoholism.     Id. at 530-531.   A\n\ncriminal convict who was permitted to work in the facility as a\n\n\"trustee\" attacked the plaintiff, resulting in the loss of sight\n\nin his left eye.    Id. at 531-532.   We held that the\n\nCommonwealth's \"affirmative decision to allow convicted inmates\n\nto work in an area where civilly committed individuals were\n\nhoused and treated\" was an \"original cause\" of the injury.      Id.\n\nat 535.\n\n    Likewise, this court held under § 10(j) that a school\n\nprincipal's decision to require first graders to take recess in\n\nan enclosed, concrete courtyard materially contributed to the\n\nsevere injury that resulted when one pupil pushed over another\n\nin the courtyard.    Gennari v. Reading Pub. Schs., 77 Mass. App.\n\nCt. 762, 764-765 (2010).   See Bonnie W. v. Commonwealth, 419\n\nMass. 122, 123-126 (1994) (Commonwealth not exempt from\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\nliability for parole officer's recommendation that convicted\n\nrapist be hired by trailer park operator in maintenance position\n\nthat gave him access to the keys of plaintiff's mobile home,\n\nwhich parolee then used to gain access to plaintiff's trailer\n\nand sexually assault her);1 Kent, 437 Mass. at 319 n.9\n\n(discussing Bonnie W. and other cases predating § 10[j]\n\nillustrating factual scenarios that could come within the\n\nconcept of \"original cause\").\n\n       The common thread in these cases is that an affirmative\n\ndecision by a public employer, not just a failure to act, played\n\na significant role in placing a vulnerable plaintiff in harm's\n\nway.       Here, as in Devlin and Gennari, the hospital made an\n\naffirmative decision to place the female plaintiff and her male\n\nassailant in a confined space -- a locked hospital unit -- for\n\ncriminal competency evaluation, and to give both men and women\n\ncommitted for evaluation access to an isolated, unmonitored\n\ncommon room.      While the majority may be correct that the\n\nhospital had no choice whom it accepted for evaluation, the\n\nhospital did make an affirmative decision to house involuntarily\n\ncommitted men and women together in a locked unit and to permit\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       By contrast, the Commonwealth was not liable for the\nsexual assault based solely on the same parole officer's failure\nto supervise the parolee. Bonnie W., 419 Mass. at 126.\n\f                                                                   5\n\n\ncommon access to the sunroom.2   Its decision materially\n\ncontributed to the situation that resulted in the plaintiff's\n\nbeing in that room, wearing a hospital gown because her only\n\nclothes were in the wash, when a male patient raped her.    \"The\n\nCommonwealth's decision was not so remote from the injury that\n\nit can be considered not to have been an original cause.\"\n\nDevlin, 83 Mass. App. Ct. at 535.\n\n     The Commonwealth bears a special responsibility for the\n\nsafety and general well-being of those who have been\n\ninvoluntarily committed to State psychiatric facilities.    See\n\n\n     2\n       Although the hospital's decision did not violate any law\nor regulation, the statutes governing the detention of females\ngenerally call for them to be housed in separate facilities from\nsimilarly situated males. See, e.g., G. L. c. 127, § 22 (\"Male\nand female prisoners shall not be put or kept in the same room\nin a jail or house of correction\"). See also G. L. c. 123, § 35\n(establishing separate commitment facilities for males and\nfemales found to be dangerous due to substance abuse disorders);\nG. L. c. 125, § 16, third par., inserted by St. 1989, c. 664,\n§ 1 (\"The department [of correction] shall maintain at the\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham, a separate\nawaiting trial unit for females\"); G. L. c. 127, § 20\n(establishing separate reception centers for male and female\nprisoners); G. L. c. 127, § 21 (allowing for classification of\nprisoners by gender \"to promote their . . . safe custody . . .\nand to secure the separation of male and female prisoners\");\nG. L. c. 127, § 83A (establishing, for male prisoners, camps for\nemployment \"in reforestation, maintenance and development of\nstate forests\"); G. L. c. 147, § 20 (if a female is arrested and\ndetained at a police station, commanding officer must summon\nmatron attached to station or, if no matron is so attached,\nremove the female prisoner to the nearest station with a\nmatron). While these laws may or may not have been enacted to\nprevent institutional rapes, they certainly reflect a concern\nthat the comingling of genders in locked facilities\naffirmatively creates health and safety risks.\n\f                                                                     6\n\n\nBrum, 428 Mass. at 699-700, citing DeShaney v. Winnebago County\n\nDept. of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200 (1989).     But even\n\nwithout any special responsibility, the Department of Mental\n\nHealth employees \"owed [the plaintiff] a duty of care, not\n\nbecause they were employed to protect persons such as [the\n\nplaintiff] and failed to do so, but because, by taking action\n\nthat exposed [the plaintiff] to risk, they were bound, as any\n\nother person would be, to act reasonably.\"   Onofrio v.\n\nDepartment of Mental Health, 408 Mass. 605, 610 (1990).     Under\n\nthese circumstances, I would conclude as a matter of law that\n\nthe Commonwealth is not immune from the plaintiff's claim of\n\nnegligence on the basis of § 10(j).\n\n    Accordingly, summary judgment should not have been allowed,\n\nand the plaintiff's MTCA claim should proceed to trial.    At\n\ntrial, the plaintiff would have the burden to prove that a rape\n\noccurred, see ante at note 4, that the hospital or its employees\n\nwere negligent, and that their negligence was a proximate cause\n\nof her injury.   See Harrison v. Mattapoisett, 78 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n367, 372-373 (2010), quoting from Jupin v. Kask, 447 Mass. 141,\n\n146 (2006) (\"To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must\n\nprove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable\n\ncare, that the defendant breached this duty, that damages\n\f                                                                 7\n\n\nresulted, and that there was a causal relation between the\n\nbreach of the duty and the damage\").3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       The majority observes that the plaintiff does not argue\nthat the hospital was negligent in assessing her alleged\nassailant's risk of violence. See ante at note 9. This\nquestion is not germane to the applicability of § 10(j).\nRather, questions such as whether the hospital reasonably\nconcluded that this particular male patient posed no risk of\nsexual assault, or whether the hospital adequately supervised\nthe common room, go to the ultimate issue of whether the\nhospital was negligent.\n\f",

The only issue before us is whether the\n\nhospital's failure to segregate by gender its patients' use of a\n\ncommon recreation room constitutes an \"original cause\" of the\n\nrape.    See G.

The hospital's\n\nHathorne Unit is a locked unit that houses, on separate\n\ncorridors, both male and female patients.5   Male patients are not\n\npermitted access onto the female corridor, and female patients\n\nare not permitted access onto the male corridor, except that\n\npatients of both genders enjoy nearly free access to a common\n\nrecreation room.    The recreation room contains a ping-pong\n\ntable, some other games, and a television set; it also leads to\n\na common sunroom which offers a second television set for\n\npatient viewing.

The record does\ninclude evidence that when a patient is admitted to the\nhospital, the Department of Mental Health's division of forensic\nmental health services conducts a check of the patient's\ncriminal background and queries the Sex Offender Registry Board\nto determine whether the patient is a registered sex offender or\nhas a history of sexual offenses.\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\n     In March, 2009, a District Court judge committed the\n\nplaintiff, who had been charged with an assault and battery, to\n\nthe hospital for a competency evaluation under G.

Commonwealth, 437 Mass. at 319-320 (where the\n\nCommonwealth did not create the condition that resulted in the\n\nvictim's shooting by a parolee, § 10[j] barred suit).    Indeed,\n\nthe Supreme Judicial Court has refused to \"adopt an\n\ninterpretation of [§ 10(j)] that construes the words 'originally\n\ncaused' so broadly as to encompass the remotest causation and\n\npreclude immunity in nearly all circumstances.\"    Brum, 428 Mass.\n\nat 695.\n\n    In Kent v. Commonwealth, 437 Mass. at 313, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court addressed an analogous situation.   There, a\n\npolice officer was shot and seriously wounded by a convicted\n\nmurderer who had been paroled years earlier.   The officer argued\n\nthat the parole board's decision to parole his assailant was an\n\noriginal cause of his injury.   Id. at 318.   The court disagreed.\n\nIt reasoned that while \"[t]here can be little doubt that the\n\n[earlier] parole decision contributed in some measure to [the\n\nshooter's] freedom [years later], at least in the sense that the\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\nparole board released him from State confinement when he might\n\notherwise still be serving his life sentence,\" that act did not\n\n\"materially contribute[]\" to creating the specific condition or\n\nsituation that resulted in harm.   Id. at 318, 319.   The same is\n\ntrue here.\n\n    There can be no question that not every man is a rapist or\n\nat risk of a sexual offense, and it is undisputed that the\n\nhospital checks its patients' criminal and sexual offending\n\nhistory before admitting them, and that it did so in this case.\n\nThe hospital made a reasoned decision, which is not at issue\n\nhere, that the male patient posed no risk of sexual assault.\n\nThe male perpetrator also did not \"appear[] to require strict\n\nsecurity,\" as indicated by his not having been committed to the\n\nBridgewater State Hospital pursuant to G. L. c. 123, § 15(b),\n\nand the hospital here had no role in committing him to its care.\n\nSee, e.g., Brum v. Dartmouth, 428 Mass. at 689 (because the\n\ndecision to release a prisoner on bail rests with the court, the\n\nprosecutor's recommendation for release was too remote to serve\n\nas a source of liability for the prisoner's attack on another).\n\nFurthermore, hospital staff performed safety checks in the room\n\nevery thirty minutes, and nothing in the summary judgment record\n\nsupports an inference that the recreation room itself made the\n\f                                                                  12\n\n\noccurrence of a rape more foreseeable.11   Contrast Gennari v.\n\nReading Pub.

First, the dissent has put forth no\nevidence that the policy decisions that led to these statutes\nconcerned a fear that the mere comingling of genders would\nresult in an increase in the number of rapes at these\ninstitutions. Second, it is noteworthy that each of these\nstatutes pertains to the segregation by gender of potentially\ndangerous detainees -- either because these individuals are\nimprisoned convicts, potentially dangerous substance abusers,\npersons held on bail, or persons awaiting arraignment whose\npotential for dangerousness has not yet been determined. See,\ne.g., G. L. c. 127, § 22 (\"Male and female prisoners shall not\nbe put or kept in the same room in a jail or house of\ncorrection\" [emphasis added]). See also G. L. c. 123, § 35\n(establishing separate commitment facilities for males and\nfemales found to be dangerous due to substance abuse disorders);\nG. L. c. 125, § 16, third par., inserted by St. 1989, c. 664,\n§ 1 (\"The department [of correction] shall maintain at the\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham, a separate\nawaiting trial unit for females\" on bail); G. L. c. 127, § 20\n(establishing separate reception centers for male and female\n\"prisoners\" [emphasis added]); G. L. c. 127, § 21 (permitting\nclassification of prisoners by gender \"to promote their . . .\nsafe custody . . . and to secure the separation of male and\nfemale prisoners\" [emphasis added]); G. L. c. 147, § 20 (if a\nfemale is arrested and detained at a police station, commanding\nofficer must summon matron attached to station or, if no matron\nis so attached, remove the female prisoner to the nearest\nstation with a matron).\n\n     The record in this case does not support an inference that\nthe mental health patients committed to the hospital for\nevaluation and placed on the Hathorne unit posed the same risks\nof dangerousness as those underlying the enactment of the\nstatutes referenced by the dissent. There is no evidence that\nthe plaintiff's assailant was being imprisoned to serve a\n\f                                                                  15\n\n\nconclude summary judgment properly entered for the Commonwealth\n\nhere.\n\n                                        Judgment affirmed.\n\n\n\n\nsentence, was being held on bail, or was potentially sexually\ndangerous.\n\f    MASSING, J.

In\n\ngeneral, the Commonwealth is not liable under the Massachusetts\n\nTort Claims Act (MTCA) for torts committed by third parties,\n\neven third parties under the supervision of public employers or\n\ntheir employees.

App. Ct. at 535.\n\n     The Commonwealth bears a special responsibility for the\n\nsafety and general well-being of those who have been\n\ninvoluntarily committed to State psychiatric facilities.    See\n\n\n     2\n       Although the hospital's decision did not violate any law\nor regulation, the statutes governing the detention of females\ngenerally call for them to be housed in separate facilities from\nsimilarly situated males. See, e.g., G. L. c. 127, § 22 (\"Male\nand female prisoners shall not be put or kept in the same room\nin a jail or house of correction\"). See also G. L. c. 123, § 35\n(establishing separate commitment facilities for males and\nfemales found to be dangerous due to substance abuse disorders);\nG. L. c. 125, § 16, third par., inserted by St. 1989, c. 664,\n§ 1 (\"The department [of correction] shall maintain at the\nMassachusetts Correctional Institution, Framingham, a separate\nawaiting trial unit for females\"); G. L. c. 127, § 20\n(establishing separate reception centers for male and female\nprisoners); G. L. c. 127, § 21 (allowing for classification of\nprisoners by gender \"to promote their . . . safe custody . . .\nand to secure the separation of male and female prisoners\");\nG. L. c. 127, § 83A (establishing, for male prisoners, camps for\nemployment \"in reforestation, maintenance and development of\nstate forests\"); G. L. c. 147, § 20 (if a female is arrested and\ndetained at a police station, commanding officer must summon\nmatron attached to station or, if no matron is so attached,\nremove the female prisoner to the nearest station with a\nmatron). While these laws may or may not have been enacted to\nprevent institutional rapes, they certainly reflect a concern\nthat the comingling of genders in locked facilities\naffirmatively creates health and safety risks.\n\f                                                                     6\n\n\nBrum, 428 Mass. at 699-700, citing DeShaney v.

Under\n\nthese circumstances, I would conclude as a matter of law that\n\nthe Commonwealth is not immune from the plaintiff's claim of\n\nnegligence on the basis of § 10(j).\n\n    Accordingly, summary judgment should not have been allowed,\n\nand the plaintiff's MTCA claim should proceed to trial.    At\n\ntrial, the plaintiff would have the burden to prove that a rape\n\noccurred, see ante at note 4, that the hospital or its employees\n\nwere negligent, and that their negligence was a proximate cause\n\nof her injury.

See ante at note 9. This\nquestion is not germane to the applicability of § 10(j).\nRather, questions such as whether the hospital reasonably\nconcluded that this particular male patient posed no risk of\nsexual assault, or whether the hospital adequately supervised\nthe common room, go to the ultimate issue of whether the\nhospital was negligent.\n\f</pre>",
