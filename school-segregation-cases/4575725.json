S e c r e ta r y :\n 1979, requesting my opinion on several questions concerning access\nrights of private owners of land located within the boundaries of the\nnational forests. Your letter poses the following questions:\n   (1) Whether the Organic Act of June 4, 1897,1 grants to private\nlandowners,2 other than actual settlers, a right of ingress to and egress\nfrom their properties located within the exterior boundaries of the\nnational forests, or whether you may deny such access;\n   (2) W hether private landowners with property located within the\nexterior boundaries of the national forests have a right-of-way across\nnational forest lands by implied easement or easement by necessity\nenforceable against the federal government; and, if so, whether this\nright-of-way is limited to those instances in which the United States by\nits conveyance created a situation in which nonfederal lands are sur­\nrounded by public lands;\n   (3) Whether, if a right-of-way exists across national forests, it has\nbeen modified by:\n                 (a) The Organic Act of June 4, 1897, 16 U.S.C. § 478;\n                 (b) The Wilderness Act, § 5(a), 16 U.S.C. § 1134(a);\n                 (c) The Act of October 13, 1964, 16 U.S.C. §§ 532-538;\n\n    1A c t o f J u n e 4. 1897, c h . 2. § 1. 30 S tat. 36 (c o d ifie d at 16 U .S .C . § 478).\n    - A s used in th is o p in io n , th e te rm “ p riv a te la n d o w n e rs \" re fe rs to all n o n fe d e ra l la n d o w n e rs unless\no th e r w is e in d icated .\n\n\n                                                                    30\n\f                (d) The Montana Wilderness Study Act of 1977, § 3, 16 U.S.C.\n              § 1132 note; or\n                (e) Any other statute; and\n   (4)   Whether § 5(a) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1134(a), au­\nthorizes you to deny access and offer as indemnity an exchange of\nnational forest land for private land, or whether the private landowner\nmay insist on a right of access.\n   I conclude, first, that the Organic Act of June 4, 1897, does not grant\na right of access to owners of land surrounded by national forests, other\nthan actual settlers, and that you have discretionary authority to deny\nsuch access, provided that a right of access does not otherwise exist. Of\ncourse, access cannot be denied arbitrarily.\n   Second, in my opinion, the common law doctrine of easement by\nnecessity does not apply to land owned by the federal government. A\nright of access may be implied from the terms of a federal land grant\nonly if Congress intended to grant the right. This intent may be show\nfrom the circumstances surrounding the grant, including the purpose\nfor which it was made.\n   Third, none of the statutes you have asked us to consider, nor any\nothers that we have found, would modify such a right in any case in\nwhich it is found to exist.\n   Fourth, I conclude that, absent a prior existing access right, you may\ndeny “adequate access” under the Wilderness Act, but you must offer a\nland exchange as indemnity.\n\n                                                                        I.\n\n  Your first question is whether Congress has given private inholders 3\na statutory right of ingress and egress with respect to their property,\nincluding a right to build roads. Congress clearly has the power to\ngrant such statutory rights.4 The question is whether it has done so.\n  Your department concludes that the Organic Act of June 4, 1897,\ngrants a right of access, including a right to build roads, to all owners\n\n     3 A n “ in h o ld e r\" is a la n d o w n e r w h o se p ro p e rty is c o m p le te ly s u rro u n d e d b y p r o p e r ty o w n e d b y\nth e U n ited S tates.

Section 478, the codifi­\ncation of § 1 of the Act, provides:\n              Nothing in sections 473 to 478, 479 to 482 and 551 of this\n              title shall be construed as prohibiting the egress or ingress\n              of actual settlers residing within the boundaries of na­\n              tional forests, or from crossing the same to and from their\n              property or homes; and such wagon roads and other im­\n              provements may be constructed thereon as may be neces­\n              sary to reach their homes and to utilize their property\n              under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by\n              the Secretary of Agriculture. Nor shall anything in such\n              sections prohibit any person from entering upon such na­\n              tional forests for all proper and lawful purposes, including\n              that of prospecting, locating, and developing the mineral\n              resources thereof. Such persons must comply with the\n              rules and regulations covering such national forests.\n   In 1962, Attorney General Kennedy was asked by the Secretary of\nAgriculture for his opinion on the meaning of this statute. See 42 Op.\nA tt’y Gen. 127 (1962). Prior to 1962, your department interpreted the\nfirst sentence of § 478 as granting a right of access to all owners of land\nsurrounded by a national forest. It reasoned that the term “ingress and\negress” included the construction of wagon roads, and that the term\n“actual settlers” included any person or corporation owning property\nwithin the boundaries of national forests. As a result, private landown­\ners, including lumber corporations, were considered to have a statutory\nright to build logging roads. Id. at 130. Attorney General Kennedy\nopined that the term “actual settlers” includes original settlers who\nreside on the land, and excludes corporations and other business enti­\nties.5 He further concluded that the Secretary of Agriculture has discre­\ntionary authority to impose a reciprocity requirement on requests by\ninholders, other than actual settlers, to use existing roads or to build\nnew roads within national forests. Id. at 142-45.\n   You have advised us that, notwithstanding the 1962 opinion, your\ndepartment has continued to maintain that § 478 creates a right of\naccess for all private inholders. This interpretation, you have informed\nus, has been based upon the second sentence of § 478, which was not\ndirectly addressed in the 1962 opinion. My review of the reasoning set\nforth in that earlier opinion, as well as my analysis of § 478 and its\nlegislative history, convinces me that no such access right exists.\n   The 1962 opinion analyzed § 478 by dividing it into the following\nthree categories: (1) ingress and egress of actual settlers; (2) construc­\n\n     5      B etw e en th e e x tre m e s o f th e o rig in a l s e ttle r a n d c o r p o ra tio n s o r b usiness e n titie s a re in te rm e d ia ry\nty p e s o f p ro p e rty o w n e rs su c h as h e irs o r assigns o f an a c tu a l s e ttle r.

A tt’y G en . 127, 138 (1962).\n\n\n                                                                       32\n\f tion of wagon roads and other improvements by actual settlers; and (3)\n entry upon the national forest for all proper and lawful purposes by any\n person. Id. at 127, 138-39. We are concerned here only with the third\ncategory because you inquire as to the rights of landowners other than\nactual settlers. In this category, “entry upon” may be subdivided into\nentry by mere ingress and egress, in particular the use of existing roads,\nand entry requiring construction of roads. Section 478 provides that\nany entry upon the forest reserve by any person is subject to the rules\nand regulations covering such national forests. The question now pre­\nsented, therefore, is whether the Secretary’s regulations may, in appro­\npriate cases, include denial of the requested entry.\n    To determine correctly the scope of rights protected by the 1897\nAct, it is necessary to study carefully the language of the Act itself, and\nits legislative history. As the legislative history is fully summarized in\nthe 1962 opinion, I note only the aspects particularly relevant here. At\nthe outset, it is helpful to review the sequence of events which led to\nthe passage of the Act. During the 1800’s the public entered freely\nupon federal land, and Congress, although it did not provide specific\nlegal authority for most uses of the public domain, made no serious\nattempt to halt such uses. See generally G. Robinson, The Forest Serv­\nice 2-5 (1978); Clawson & Held, The Federal Lands 46 (1957). This\ntacit approval constituted an open invitation to the public to avail itself\nof the federal land without specific authorization. Most people assumed\nthat the United States was a temporary titleholder and that the land\nwould eventually pass into private ownership. See R. Robbins, Our\nLanded Heritage: The Public Domain, 1776-1970, 5-6 (1976). The\npublic land laws of the era, including preemption laws,6 homestead\nlaws,7 and mining laws,8 presumed unimpeded access to the public\ndomain.\n   This policy of unimpeded access was recognized by the Supreme\nCourt in Buford v. Houtz, 133 U.S. 320, 326 (1890), a case in which the\nCourt considered the complaints of owners of alternate odd-numbered\nsections of land that sheepowners were damaging their land by driving\n\n     6T h e A c t o f M ay 29, 1830, 4 S tal. 4 2 0 -2 1 , first g ra n te d p re e m p tio n rig h ts to settlers.

The Court denied plaintiffs’ request for an injunction with the\nfollowing explanation:\n             We are of opinion that there is an implied license, grow­\n             ing out of the custom of nearly a hundred years, that the\n             public lands of the United States . . . shall be free to the\n             people who seek to use them where they are left open\n             and unenclosed, and no act of government forbids this\n             use. . ..\n             The whole system of the control of the public lands of\n             the United States as it had been conducted by the G ov­\n             ernment, under acts of Congress, shows a liberality in\n             regard to their use which has been uniform and\n             remarkable.\n133 U.S. at 326-27. The Court refused to allow the complainants, under\nthe pretense of owning a small portion of a tract of land, to obtain\ncontrol over the entire tract and thereby deny defendants their privi­\nlege to use the public domain. 133 U.S. at 322. See also, Broder v. Water\nCo., 101 U.S. 274, 276 (1879) (Court noted conduct of government\nencouraging development of mines and construction of canals and\nditches on public domain); Forbes v. Gracey, 94 U.S. 762 (1876) (Court\nnoted tacit consent to enter upon the public lands for the purposes of\nmining); Atchison v. Peterson, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 507 (1874) (Court noted\n“silent acquiescence” to the general occupation of the public lands for\nmining).\n   In the late 19th century, efforts expanded to protect the Nation’s\nnatural resources from the results of what were perceived as overly\ngenerous land-use policies. See Robbins, supra, at 301-24. In 1891, the\nCongress passed a law authorizing the President to reserve forest lands\nfrom the public domain. Act of March 3, 1891, ch. 561, §24, 26 Stat.\n1103. One provision of this Act, § 24, later known as the Forest Re­\nserve Act of 1891, was added as an amendment by the conference\ncommittee.9 The amended bill was considered in the closing days of the\nCongress on an oral presentation of its terms, no printed version being\navailable. It was approved with little debate.10 The status of these forest\n\n   9 S e c tio n 24 p ro v id e d :\n          [T ]h e P re sid e n t o f th e U n ite d S ta te s m a y , fro m tim e to tim e, set a p a rt an d re se rv e , in\n          a n y S ta te o r T e r rito r y h a v in g p u b lic land b e a rin g forests, a n y part- o f th e p u b lic lands\n          w h o lly o r in p a rt c o v e re d w ith tim b e r o r u n d e rg ro w th , w h e th e r o f c o m m e rc ia l valu e\n          o r n o t, as p u b lic re s e rv a tio n s , an d th e P resid en t shall, by p u b lic p ro c la m a tio n , d e c la re\n          th e esta b lish m e n t o f su ch re s e rv a tio n s an d th e lim its th e reo f.\n    l0S o m e S e n a to rs ex p ressed c o n c e rn ab o u t not k n o w in g e x a c tly w h a t w as in .t h e r e p o rt, b u t th e\nm a jo rity felt th a t in th e c lo sin g d a y s o f th e session “ th e re has g o t to be s o m e th in g ta k en fo r g ra n te d o r\nelse th e p u b lic b usiness c a n n o t g o fo rw a rd as it should.*’ 22 C o n g .

Presidential Proclamations Nos. 19-31,\nFeb. 22, 1897, 29 Stat. 893-912. Within the boundaries of the reserves\nwere villages, patented mining claims, homestead claims of actual set­\ntlers and other developments. See 30 Cong. Rec. 901-02 (1897). Each of\nthe proclamations contained the following admonition: “Warning is\nhereby expressly given to all persons not to enter or make settlement\nupon the tract of land reserved by this proclamation.” See, e.g., 29 Stat.\n894 (1897). The proclamations also prohibited the general use of timber\non the reserves, and jeopardized other theretofore legitimate activities\nof persons living within or near the reserves.\n   Congressmen from states affected by the proclamations expressed\noutrage at what they considered the President’s hasty and ill-advised\naction. 30 Cong. Rec. 902 (1897). This reaction culminated in the\npassage of an amendment to the Sundry Civil Expense Appropriation\nAct, 30 Stat. 36 (1897). This amendment was designed to solve the\n“difficulties surrounding these forest reservations” (id. at 900) and to\nprovide for “administering the forest so reserved” (id. at 909).11 Senator\nCarter of Montana explained that the amendment was offered “not for\nthe purpose of benefitting any particular individual or class of individ­\nuals, but for the purpose of permitting existing communities in the\nUnited States to enjoy the privileges which have ordinarily been ac­\ncorded to the pioneer settlers on the frontier everywhere.” Id. at 902.\nOther Senators also criticized the provision prohibiting entry or settle­\nment upon the reserves. Id. at 910-11. Senator Allison of Iowa stated:\n“[I]f segregations are made I think every interest existing at the time,\nhowever remote it may be, should be protected.” Id. at 911 (emphasis\nadded). The House debate on the amendment indicates that the con­\ngressmen also were concerned about preserving existing uses of the\nforest reserves. Id. at 1007-13 (remarks of Representatives Castle,\nKnowles, Lacy, and DeVries).12\n   The bill was referred to a conference committee, which reported the\nbill without changes in or comments upon the access section. Id. at\n1242-43. During the Senate debate on the conference report, some of\nthe same western Senators on whose behalf the amendment was intro­\nduced sought to change the clause “actual settlers residing within the\nboundaries of national forests” to “bona fide settlers or owners within a\nreservation.” Id. at 1278-81. Senator White explained that the provision\n\n    “ T h e a m e n d m e n t te m p o ra rily re s to re d th e w ith d ra w n lands to th e p u b lic d o m a in b y su sp e n d in g\nth e o p e ra tio n o f th e p re sid e n tia l p ro c la m a tio n s fo r a p p ro x im a te ly o n e year. 30 C o n g .

Id. at 1278. The amendment was defeated.\nId. at 1285. Opponents of the amendment emphasized that there was no\nintent to deprive any person of access to his property, and that “what­\never rights have been acquired as respects the public lands under the\npublic land laws are reserved and preserved.” Id. at 1283. It was noted\nthat entry upon the forests was subject to the rules and regulations of\nthe Secretary of Interior (who then had this administrative authority)\nand that such rules would not likely prevent access to a person’s home.\nId. at 1280 (remarks of Senator Berry). Notwithstanding the concession\nthat the bill was “imperfect,” the conference report was agreed to. It\nwas pointed out that further amendment would cause substantial delay\nand that any evils could be corrected by subsequent legislation. Id. at\n 1282—83. The House adopted the conference report without debate on\nthis provision. Id. at 1397-401.\n   This legislative history demonstrates that the effect of the second\nsentence of § 478 is to protect whatever rights and licenses with regard\nto the public domain existed prior to the reservation. We interpret the\nprovision as a congressional declaration that the establishment of forest\nreserves would not alter the long-standing policy of allowing\nunimpeded access to the public land or interfere with the rights of\npersons then using the land, not as an affirmative grant of a broad right\nof entry to all persons. The express language of the statute provides\nthat nothing in the act shall be construed to prohibit certain activities.\nThe language grants no rights not already in existence. See Robbins,\nsupra, at 323; John Ise, The United States Forest Policy 140 (1920).\n   The protection of “lawful” and “proper” entry upon the reserves\ncannot be construed to limit congressional authority to regulate such\nentry. No vested right to use the public domain for a particular purpose\narises from the government’s mere acquiescence in such use. In Light v.\nUnited States, 220 U.S. 523 (1911), the Court wrote:\n        [WJithout passing a statute, or taking any affirmative\n        action on the subject, the United States suffered its public\n        domain to be used for such purposes. There thus grew up\n        a sort of implied license that these lands, thus left open,\n        might be used so long as the Government did not cancel\n        its tacit consent. Buford v. Houtz, 133 U.S. 326. Its failure\n        to object, however, did not confer any vested right on the\n        complainant, nor did it deprive the United States of the\n        power of recalling any implied license under which the\n        land had been used for private purposes.\nId. at 535. See also The Yosemite Valley Case, 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 77\n(1872); Frisbie v. Whitney, 76 U.S. (9 Wall.) 187, 194 (1869).\n   Section 478 clearly subjects entry upon the national forests to reason­\nable regulation by the Secretary. Prior to the enactment of the Federal\n                                   36\n\f Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43 U.S.C.\n§§ 1701-1782, and its repeal of § 2 of the Act of June 4, 1897, 16 U.S.C.\n§ 551, insofar as the latter section applied to the issuance of rights-of-\nway through public lands, the Secretary was required to read § 478 and\n§551 together. United States v. Grimaud, 220 U.S. 506, 515 (1911).\nSection 551 provides that the Secretary shall “make such rules and\nregulations and establish such service as will insure the objects of such\nreservations, namely, to regulate their occupancy and use and to pre­\nserve the forests thereon from destruction . . .     This section was held\nto confer upon the Secretary a “broad scope of regulation” intended to\n“be effective.” See 42 Op. A tt’y Gen. 127, 140, citing Chicago Mil. & St.\nP. Ry. v. United States, 218 F. 288, 298 (9th Cir. 1914), affd, 244 U.S.\n358 (1917); Shannon v. United States, 160 F. 870, 873 (9th Cir. 1908). In\nGrimaud, the Court stated that the Secretary “is required to make\nprovisions to protect the forest reserves from depredation and harmful\nuses.” 220 U.S. at 552. The Secretary’s authority to grant rights-of-way\nacross national forest lands now is based on 16 U.S.C. §§ 532-538, and\nFLPMA, 43 U.S.C. §§ 1761-1771. Both statutes authorize the Secretary\nto protect the forest lands.13\n  This interpretation is consistent with the 1962 opinion of the A ttor­\nney G eneral.14 His review of the legislative history of §478 disclosed a\nlegislative desire to protect explicitly only the rights of ingress and\negress of actual settlers. 42 Op. A tt’y Gen. 127, 138. He found that\nentry upon the national forests by all other persons is subject to your\nrules and regulations covering the forests and discussed the scope of\nyour regulatory authority as follows:\n\n     ,3 S ectio n 504 o f F L P M A . 43 U .S .C . § 1764, d ire c ts ih e S e c re ta ry to issue re g u la tio n s w ith re s p e c t\nto th e te rm s an d c o n d itio n s o f th e rig h ts-o f-w a y .

The imposition of harsh and oner­\n           ous requirements not related to the benefit received or to\n           your general responsibility to preserve and manage the\n           national forests, might well constitute an abuse of\n           discretion.\n42 Op. A tt’y Gen. at 147.\n   Your department argues that it has a long-standing policy that the\nSecretary is without discretion to deny access under § 478, and that a\nchange in this policy would have a drastic effect on the well-established\nexpectations of landowners within the national forests. It is a familiar\nprinciple that interpretations made contemporaneously with the enact­\nment of a statute and consistently followed for a long period are\nentitled to great weight, particularly if they have been relied on by the\npublic. See Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 192-93 (1969); Alaska S.S. Co.\nv. United States, 290 U.S. 256, 262 (1933); Norwegian Nitrogen Products\nCo. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 315 (1933). Correspondingly, when\nan agency’s interpretation has been neither consistent nor long-standing,\nthe weight given it diminishes accordingly. See Southeastern Community\nCollege v. Davis, 422 U.S. 397, 411-12 (1979); United Housing Founda­\ntion, Inc. v. Forman, 421 U.S. 837, 858-59 n.25 (1975). Prior to 1962,\nyour department relied on the first sentence of § 478 to find the same\nrights you now find in the second sentence. This 1962 revision of the\ndepartment’s interpretation occurred almost 70 years after enactment of\nthe statute.15\n   In any case, to the extent that my judgment is governed by the\ncustomary rules of statutory construction, I am guided by the overrid­\ning rule that the statute, and not the agency’s interpretation, is conclu­\nsive. See, e.g., VolksWagenwerk v. Federal Maritime Commission, 390\nU.S. 261, 272 (1968). Additionally, I am persuaded by the legislative\nhistory and by the common sense rule that legislative history disclosing\nCongress’ intent is entitled to more weight than a conflicting adminis­\ntrative interpretation and must control. See Norwegian Nitrogen Products\nCo. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 315 (1933); Sutherland, Statutes and\nStatutory Construction §49.04 (1973 & Supp. 1975).\n   In sum, I conclude that § 478 does not grant access rights to private\ninholders other than actual settlers. In my opinion, absent a right of\naccess otherwise granted to the landowner by Congress, you may deny\nrequested access if such denial will protect the public interest in the\n\n     14 In S oriano v. U nited States. 494 F .2 d 681, 683 (9 th C ir. 1974), th e c o u r t d e c lin e d to g iv e sp ecial\nd e fe re n c e to a re g u la tio n p ro m u lg a te d m o re th a n 100 y ea rs a fte r e n a c tm e n t o f th e statu te.\n\n\n                                                            38\n\f land to be traversed. Because you may not arbitrarily deny access to\n private landowners, I do not foresee that this interpretation will have a\n drastic effect on their expectations.\n\n                                                                        II.\n\n    Your second question is whether an inholder has an easement by\n necessity or other implied easement across national forest land. The\n conclusion in Part I (that § 478 does not grant a right of access to\n private property across national forest reserves, and that, absent an\naccess right otherwise guaranteed to a landowner by Congress, § 478\nallows denial of access) renders apparent the importance of this\nquestion.\n    In the 1962 opinion, the Attorney General stated that whether an\neasement by necessity lies against the government is a complex and\ncontroversial question. While he concluded that it need not be decided\nat that time, the Attorney General nonetheless offered his view that\nsuch an easement does not exist over public lands. 42 Op. A tt’y Gen.\n 127, 148. It is also my view that the common law doctrine of easement\nby necessity does not apply to congressional disposition of the public\ndomain. This does not mean, however, that access cannot otherwise be\nimplied. In my opinion, access may be implied if it is necessary to\neffectuate the purpose for which the land was granted.\n    The doctrine of easement by necessity is a common law property\nconcept that was recently described by the Supreme Court as follows:\n“Where a private landowner conveys to another individual a portion of\nhis lands in a certain area and retains the rest, it is presumed at common\nlaw that the grantor has reserved an easement to pass over the granted\nproperty if such passage is necessary to reach the retained property.”\nLeo Sheep Co. v. United States, 440 U.S. 668, 679 (1979).16 Authoritative\ntreatises on property law identify three basic prerequisites to the cre­\nation of an easement by necessity.17 First, the titles to the two tracts in\nquestion at some time must have been held by one person. This is the\nunity-of-title requirement. Second, the unity of title must have been\nsevered by a conveyance of one of the tracts. Third, the easement must\nbe necessary in order for the owner of the dominant tenement to use\nhis land. This necessity must exist both at the time of the severance of\ntitle and at the time of application for the exercise of the easement.18\n\n     16 In L eo Sheep, th e C o u rt c o n s id e re d th e q u estio n w h e th e r th e U n ite d S ta te s h ad re s e rv e d an\nea sem en t to pass o v e r lan d s w h ic h h ad passed fro m fed eral o w n e rs h ip .

Here fed­\neral law must control. The Constitution vests in Congress alone author­\nity to dispose of and make needful rules concerning the public domain.\nU.S. Const., Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. As I have noted earlier in this opinion,\nthis power is vested in Congress “without limitation.” United States v.\nGratiot, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 526, 537 (1840). See also Kleppe v.

Grant River Dam Authority, 363\nU.S. 229, 235 (1960); United States v. Union Pac. Ry., 353 U.S. 112, 116\n(1957).23 In Pearsall v. Great No. Ry., 161 U.S. 646, 664 (1895), the\nCourt wrote: “Nothing is to be taken as conceded . . . but what is\ngiven in unmistakeable terms, or by an implication equally clear. . . .”\nThese general rules must not be applied to defeat the intent of Con­\ngress, however. The Supreme Court has stated that public grants are\n“not to be construed as to defeat the intent of the legislature, or to\nwithhold what is given either expressly or by necessary or fair\n implication. . . .” United States v. Denver & Rio Grande R.R., 150 U.S.\n 1, 14 (1893). In all cases, the intent of Congress must control. Id. See\nalso Missouri, K. & T. Ry. v. Kansas Pac. Ry., 97 U.S. 491, 497 (1878).\n   These rules dictate that if it is clear that Congress intended to grant\naccess, such access must be acknowledged, its scope consistent with the\npurposes for which the grant was made.24 An implied easement defined\nby the actual intent of Congress must be distinguished from an ease­\nment by necessity, which relies on a presumed intent of the parties.\nThere are no clear uniform rules for determining the scope of an\neasement by necessity. In some cases, it has been held that the scope\nincludes whatever access is necessary for any reasonable, beneficial use\nof the dominant tenement, not merely the use for which the grant was\nmade. See, e.g., New York Cent. R.R. v. Yarian, 219 Ind. 477, 39 N.E.2d\n604, 606 (1942); Soltis v. Miller, 444 Pa. 357, 283 A.2d 369, 370-71\n(1971); Meyers v. Dunn, 49 Conn. 71, 78 (1881); Whittier v. Winkley, 62\nN.H. 338, 339-40 (1882); Jones on Easements § 323 (1898). Since the\ncommon law doctrine is based on the presumed intent of the parties, its\noperation may have the effect of disregarding or possibly frustrating the\nintention of the grantor, absent express language in the conveyance\ndenying an easement. 2 G. Thompson, Law of Real Property § 362\n(1961), citing Lord v. Sanchez, 136 Cal. App. 2d 704 289 P.2d 41 (1955);\nMoore v. Indiana & Michigan Elec. Co., 299 Ind. 309, 95 N.E.2d 210\n(1950). Thus, if the doctrine were allowed to operate where the G ov­\nernment is the grantor, the actual intent of Congress would, at the least,\n\n    23 W e n o te th a t y o u r d e p a rtm e n t, w ith o u l re a c h in g th e ea sem en t-b y -n e cessity issue, h as c o n c lu d e d\nth a t an ex a m in atio n o f th e g ra n tin g s ta tu te is essential to d e te rm in in g a c cess rig h ts.

Plainly, the\napplication of the common law doctrine would be inconsistent with the\nestablished principles that the intent of Congress in disposing of federal\nland must control, and that rights in government land cannot be pre­\nsumed to pass by implication.25\n   The doctrine of easements by necessity was developed to settle\ndisputes between private parties, not disputes involving the federal\ngovernm ent.26 The federal government has at one time held title to\nover three-fourths of the territory of the United States; it today retains\ntitle to approximately one-third of the nation’s land. One-Third of the\nNation’s Land: A Report to the President and to Congress by the\nPublic Land Law Review Comm’n, at 8 (1970). It holds property as\nsovereign, as well as proprietor, and exercises power beyond that\nwhich is available to a private party. Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S.\n529, 539 (1976); Light v. United States, 220 U.S. 523, 536-37 (191 1).\nThroughout its history, statutes have been enacted allowing access\nacross its land.27 It holds land in trust for all the people and in dispos­\ning of it is concerned with the public interest. Utah Power & Light Co.\nv. United States, 243 U.S. 389, 409 (1917); Causey v. United States, 240\nU.S. 399, 402 (1916). In Causey, the Court wrote that “the Government\nin disposing of its public lands does not assume the attitude of mere\nseller of real estate at its market value.” Id.\n   For these reasons, other doctrines applicable to private landowners\nhave been held inapplicable to the sovereign. In Jourdan v. Barrett, 45\nU.S. (4 How.) 169, 184-85 (1846), the Supreme Court held that no\nprescriptive rights may be obtained against the sovereign, and in Field\nv. Seabury, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 323, 332-33 (1856), the Court held that\ngovernment patents may not be collaterally attacked as can grants from\na private party. In United States v.

Id. at 40.\n   These same reasons lead me to conclude, as did the Court in Leo\nSheep, that the doctrine of easements by necessity as applicable to\nfederal lands is “somewhat strained, and ultimately of little signifi­\ncance” and that the “pertinent inquiry . . . is the intent of Congress.” 28\nA grantee is entitled instead to reasonable access across government\nland to use his property, for the purposes for which the land grant was\nmade, if such an access right either expressly or impliedly arises from\nthe act authorizing the land grant.29\n  To interpret correctly congressional intent underlying a statutory\nland grant, it is necessary to look at the condition of the country when\nthe grant was made, as well as the declared purpose of the grant. Leo\nSheep Co. v. United States, 440 U.S. 668, 682 (1979); Winona & St. Paul\nR.R. v. Barney, 113 U.S. 618, 625 (1885); Platt v. Union Pacif. R.R., 99\nU.S. 48, 64 (1878). In Superior Oil Co. v. United States, 353 F.2d 34 (9th\nCir. 1965), for example, the court looked to the purpose of the grant\nand concluded that the scope of the implied access was not broad\nenough to include the type of entry sought. The plaintiff oil company\nwas a lessee of a religious mission which had received a land patent to\nfacilitate and encourage its activities among the Indians. The land in\nquestion was surrounded by the Hopi Reservation, which the United\nStates held in trust for the Indians. The issue on appeal was whether\n\n     28In L eo Sheep Co. v.

In ruling that access\n was limited to the scope of the grant, the court stated:\n        Certainly it cannot be said either that public policy de­\n        mands or that the Indians’ trustee impliedly intended a\n        grant of a way of access across Indian lands greater in\n        scope than was required for mission purposes and whose\n        greater scope was necessary only in order to permit the\n        granted lands to be used in a fashion adverse to the\n        interests of the Indians.30\n   Although some courts that have dealt with this issue have written in\nterms of easements by necessity, most of them in effect have looked at\nthe grant in question and limited access according to the purpose of the\ngrant. The Superior Oil case was relied on by the Tenth Circuit in\nKinscherff v. United States, 586 F.2d 159 (10th Cir. 1978), which held:\n              An easement by necessity for some purposes could possibly\n              have arisen when the United States granted the patent to\n              plaintiffs’ predecessor in interest. . . . While nothing ordi­\n              narily passes by implication in a patent, Walton v. United\n              States, 415 F.2d 121 (10th Cir.), an implied easement may\n              arise within the scope o f the patent.\nId. at 161 (emphasis added).\n   Similar statements appear in Utah v. Andrus, (unreported) C 79-0037\n(D. Utah Oct. 1, 1979), in which Utah claimed an easement by neces­\nsity for access to its school grant lands. Relying on United States v.\nDunn, 478 F.2d 443, 444 n.2 (9th Cir. 1973), the district court con­\ncluded: “Although this common law presumption might not ordinarily\napply in the context of a Federal land grant, the liberal rules of\nconstruction applied to school trust land allowed for the consideration\nof this common law principle and justify its application here.” 31 The\n\n     30T h e c o u r t, in e ffec t, c re a te d a h y b rid d o c trin e , a p p ly in g p rin c ip le s o f b o th w a y s o f n ec essity an d\n w a y s c r e a te d b y th e a c tu a l in ten t o f th e g ra n to r:\n             A p p e lla n t's p o sitio n is sim p ly th a t sin ce th e p a te n t fo r th e M ission w as in u n re s tric te d\n             fee sim p le it c a rrie d w ith it by im p lic a tio n a w a y o f n e c e ssity o v e r lan d s o f th e U n ited\n             S ta te s fo r all p u rp o s e s to w h ic h th e c o n v e y e d land m ig h t la w fu lly b e put.\n             S u c h is n o t th e law .

It\nreasoned:\n            Under the Constitution Congress has the authority and\n            responsibility to manage Federal land. U.S. Const, art. IV,\n            § 3, cl. 2. . . . There is nothing in the school land grant\n            program that would indicate that when Congress devel­\n            oped the school land grant scheme it intended to abrogate\n            its right to control activity on Federal land. Further, it is\n            consistent with common law property principles to find\n            that the United States, as the holder of the servient tene­\n            ment, has the right to limit the location and use of Utah’s\n            easement of access to that which is necessary for the\n            state’s reasonable enjoyment of its right. . . . Thus, the\n            court holds that, although the State of Utah or its lessee\n            must be allowed access to section 36, the United States\n            may regulate the manner of access under statutes such as\n            FLPMA.\nSlip Op. at 21.\n   Cases like Superior Oil, Kinscherff, and Utah v. Andrus lend support\nto my conclusions with respect to implied rights to access across\nfederal land. While the common law easement by necessity does not\nrun against the United States, a right to access may nonetheless be\nimplied by reference to particular grants. And, to the extent that such\nimplied rights exist, your broad authority—delegated to you by Con­\ngress—to manage forest reserves empowers you to regulate their exer­\ncise. See United States v. Perko, 108 F. Supp. 315, 322-23 (D. Minn.\n1952), affd, 204 F.2d 446 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 346 U.S. 832 (1953);\nPerko v. Northwest Paper Co., 133 F. Supp. 560, 569 (D. Minn. 1955).\n   Determining what implied rights exist in the numerous federal land\ngrants is beyond the scope of this opinion. As set forth above, this\ndetermination depends on when the grant was made and for what\npurpose. Mindful of the goal of giving effect to legislative intent, you\nmust look to the rules the Supreme Court has adopted for interpretation\nof federal land grants. As discussed previously, land grants generally\nare to be strictly construed. This rule must be balanced against the\nconflicting rule that in some situations, certain types of land grants may\ndeserve a more liberal construction because of the circumstances sur­\nrounding passage of the statutes in question. See generally Leo Sheep Co.\nv. United States, 440 U.S. 668, 682-83 (1979) (railroad land grants);\n\nd o c trin e o f ea se m e n t b y n ec essity is n o t b in d in g o n th e U n ite d S tates. . .      Id. at 446.

United States, 255 U.S. 489, 508 (1921) (state school land\ngrants). Absent express language to the contrary, however, a grant\nshould not be construed to include broad rights to use retained govern­\nment property, particularly in the case of gratuitous grants. See United\nStates v. Union Pac. R.R., 353 U.S. 112 (1957); Camfield v. United\nStates, 167 U.S. 518 (1897); Wisconsin Central R.R. v. United States, 164\nU.S. 190 (1896); 30 Op. A tt’y Gen. 263, 264 (1941).\n   Once the right, if any, is found to exist, you should consider how\nthat right reasonably should be regulated to protect the public’s interest\nin federal property. It is beyond dispute that such rights are subject to\nreasonable regulation without a resulting inverse condemnation. See\ngenerally Johnson v. United States, 479 F.2d 1383 (Ct. Cl. 1973) (restric­\ntion of access by erection of fence enclosing extended portion of high­\nway held not a taking); 2 Nichols on Eminent Domain § 5.72[1] (1978).\nNonetheless, fewer restrictions properly may be imposed on well\nestablished, developed uses than on unexercised rights. See Penn Central\nTransp. Corp. v. City o f New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978); Euclid v. Amber\nRealty Co., 272 U.S. 365 (1926). Frustration and appropriation are\nessentially different things. United States v. Grand River Dam Authority,\n363 U.S. 229, 236 (1960), citing Omnia Co. v. United States, 261, 502,\n513 (1923).\n\n                                                                   III.\n\n   Your third question is whether any act of Congress has modified any\nimplied rights that may accompany federal grants. Of particular con­\ncern are the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. §§1131-1136, and various\nwilderness study acts.32 See, e.g., Montana Wilderness Study Act of\n1977, Pub. L. No. 95-150, 91 Stat. 1243; Sheep Mtn. and Snow Mtn.\nWilderness Areas, et al., Pub. L. No. 94-557, § 3, 90 Stat. 2635 (1976).\nThese wilderness study acts require you to exercise your discretion so\nas to preserve the wilderness character of the land.33 If a request for a\nparticular mode of access would destroy that wilderness character,\ntherefore, you must deny the request. These acts also provide, how­\never, that their mandates are subject to “existing private rights.” 34 See,\ne.g., Montana Wilderness Study Act, § 3(a), 16 U.S.C. § 1132 note. You\nmust determine, therefore, what implied access rights are guaranteed in\na particular grant, and allow the exercise of those rights.

The Organic Act of 1897, 16 U.S.C. §478, discussed at length in\nPart I of this opinion, preserves access rights existing at the time of\ncreation of a forest reserve. The Act of October 13, 1964, 16 U.S.C.\n532-538, which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to grant ease­\nments for road rights-of-way over lands administered by the Forest\nService,35 was passed in reaction to Attorney General Kennedy’s 1962\ninterpretation of 16 U.S.C. §478, which, as discussed earlier, allowed\nthe imposition of a reciprocity requirement with respect to rights-of-\nway. By empowering the Secretary of Agriculture to grant permanent\neasements, the Congress hoped to provide an alternative to statutory\nassurance of access to and from private inholdings.36 Thus, the statute\ndoes not substantively modify implied rights of access. It does, along\nwith FLPMA, allow the imposition of certain procedural requirements,\nsuch as application for a permit prior to road construction. We have\nfound no other statute that substantively modifies implied access rights.\n\n                                                                    IV.\n\n   Your final question concerns § 5(a) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C.\n1134(a). Your department has concluded that this provision guarantees\na private owner “adequate access” to an inholding unless the land­\nowner voluntarily chooses a land exchange. Pursuant to this interpreta­\ntion, regulations have been promulgated providing that access “shall be\ngiven.” 37 The Department of the Interior has taken the position that\n§ 5(a) grants the Secretary of the Interior (and, by analogy, the Secre­\ntary of Agriculture) the authority to deny access to a landowner, and\n\n   3516 U .S .C . § 533.

The\npurpose of the Wilderness Act is to “secure for the American people of\npresent and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of\nwilderness.” 16 U.S.C. § 1131(a). “Wilderness” is defined as an area of\n“undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influ­\nence, without permanent improvements or human habitation.” 16\nU.S.C. § 1131(c). Section 4(c) of the Act prohibits, with limited excep­\ntions, use of motor vehicles or other mechanical transportation. 16\nU.S.C. § 1133(c). It also prohibits permanent roads within any wilder­\nness area, except as specifically provided in the Act, and subject to\n“existing private rights.” Id. The Act directs you to administer wilder­\nness areas within your jurisdiction so as to preserve their wilderness\ncharacter. 16 U.S.C. § 1133(b). The phrase “existing private rights” in\n§ 4(c), 16 U.S.C. § 1133(c), is not defined in the Act or in its legislative\nhistory, but, in my opinion, includes existing easements, which are well-\nrecognized rights in property.39 Thus, in spite of the A ct’s general\nprohibitions, if a private inholder has an implied right to a particular\ntype of access, that right is preserved.\n   The Wilderness Act was developed over a 15-year period, with\nalmost unprecedented citizen participation. See S. Rep. No. 109, 88th\nCong., 1st Sess. 7 (1963). The first major wilderness bill was introduced\nin the 85th Congress. S. 1176, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957). In 1961, the\nSenate passed a wilderness bill, S. 174, but the House failed to pass it.\n\n     38 S u p p le m e n ta l M e m o ra n d u m In S u p p o rt o f P la in tifT s M o tio n fo r P e rm a n e n t In ju n c tio n , at 14-19,\n U n ited S ta tes v.

It provides:\n               In any case where State-owned or privately owned land\n            is completely surrounded by national forest lands within\n            areas designated by this chapter as wilderness, such State\n            or private owner shall be given such rights as may be\n            necessary to assure adequate access to such State-owned\n            or privately owned land by such State or private owner\n            and their successors in interest, or the State-owned land\n            or privately owned land shall be exchanged for federally\n            owned land in the same State of approximately equal\n            value under authorities available to the Secretary of Agri­\n            culture: Provided, however, that the United States shall\n            not transfer to a State or private owner any mineral\n            interests unless the State or private owner relinquishes or\n            causes to be relinquished to the United States the mineral\n            interest in the surrounded land.\nSince the enactment of the Wilderness Act, your department has inter­\npreted this language to preserve the statutory right of access you found\nin 16 U.S.C. § 478.40 Because, in my opinion, §478 does not grant a\nright of access to inholders other than actual settlers, the question\npresented here is whether § 5(a) grants to inholders a broad right of\n“adequate access” beyond any existing private rights. I believe it does\nnot.\n   The term “adequate access” is not defined in the Act, but the legisla­\ntive history makes clear that the term includes access not consistent\nwith wilderness uses.41 For example, in both the Senate and House\n\n    40S ee n o te 37 supra.\n    41       O th e r sectio n s a p p ly to uses c o n s is te n t w ith w ild e rn e ss p re s e rv a tio n .

See, e.g., 107 Cong. Rec. 18,105 (1961); 109 Cong. Rec.\n5,925-26 (1963). Accordingly, your regulation defining “adequate\naccess” does not limit access to established uses or to means consistent\nwith wilderness uses. It includes access which “will serve the reason­\nable purposes for which the state and private land is held or used.” 42\nWhat constitutes adequate access will depend on the facts and circum­\nstances o f each case, and is a determination left to your discretion.\n   The Act requires that the state or private inholder be given such\nrights as are necessary to assure adequate access, or that the land be\nexchanged for federally owned land of approximately equal value. The\nlanguage of § 5(a) indicates that a landowner has a right to access or\nexchange. If he is offered either,, he has been accorded all the rights\ngranted by the statute. If you offer land exchange, the landowner has\nno right of access under § 5(a). This interpretation is supported by the\nlegislative history of the section.43\n   The language of § 5(a) first appeared in an amendment to S. 174, 87th\nCong., 1st Sess. (1961). Senator Bennett of Utah proposed the amend­\nment in response to concerns of the Western Association of State Land\nCommissioners, and, accordingly, the amendment pertained only to\nstate-owned land. 107 Cong. Rec. 18,092 (1961).44 The Senator identi­\nfied a series of “loopholes” in the bill. He described the 13th loophole\nas follows: “No provision is made in S. 174 to preserve the right of\n\no c c u p a n c ie s.

This should certainly be\ndone or alternatively, the States should be permitted to choose Federal\nlands in another location in lieu of the land isolated within wilderness\nareas.” Id. The choice referred to by Senator Bennett was the choice of\nlands if access were denied, not the choice of either access or exchange.\nHe stated that the purpose of his amendment was to “give the States\naccess to State lands within wilderness areas established under the bill,\nor indemnify the States for loss of such access.” 107 Cong. Rec. 18,103\n(1961). He did not indicate that a state could choose between access\nand indemnity. His amendment provided in part:\n          In any case where State-owned land is completely sur­\n       rounded by lands incorporated into the wilderness system\n       such State shall be given (1) such rights as may be neces­\n       sary to assure adequate access to such State-owned land\n       by such State and its successors in interest, or (2) land in\n       the same State, not exceeding the value of the surrounded\n       land, in exchange for the surrounded land. Exchanges of\n       land under the provisions of this subsection shall be ac­\n       complished in the manner provided for the exchange of\n       lands in national forests.\n107 Cong. Rec. 18,103 (1961). In urging support of his amendment,\nSenator Bennett explained:45\n      [T]he Western Association of State Land Commissioners\n      unanimously adopted a resolution calling for indemnifica­\n      tion to the States which will lose access to State lands in\n      wilderness areas established under S. 174. Where State\n      school sections or other State lands are isolated by wilder­\n      ness areas, the State should be given an opportunity, if\n      access is denied, to make in lieu selections of Federal lands\n      in other areas.\nId. (emphasis added).46 These statements demonstrate that Senator\nBennett believed that access not consistent with wilderness preservation\ncould be denied, and wanted to give states an alternative in such\ncircumstances.\n   The Senator later explained that his amendment was designed to\ncorrect problems states had experienced with land exchanges in the\npast. 107 Cong. Rec. 18,105 (1961). He wanted to ensure that if the\nstate land was “locked up,” the state clearly would be entitled to an\nexchange. He further explained:\n\n     45 A u th o rity to e x c h a n g e land is p ro v id e d by 16 U .S .C . § § 4 8 5 , 486 (o rig in a lly e n a c te d as A c t o f\nM ar. 20, 1922, c h . 105, 42 S tat. 465) an d 16 U .S .C . § 516 (o rig in a lly e n a c te d as A c t o f M ar. 3, 1925,\nch . 473, 43 S tat. 1215).\n     46 H is b e lie f th a t a c cess to sta te -o w n e d lan d s m a y be d e n ie d e n tire ly m a y resu lt in p a rt fro m th e\nla n g u a g e o f § 4 (c ) , 16 U .S .C . § 1133(c), w h ic h s p ecifically p ro te c te d o n ly ex istin g priva te rig h ts. H e\nm a d e n o s ta te m e n ts re ly in g on th is la n g u ag e, h o w e v e r.\n\n\n                                                                 51\n\f       The first choice, providing that the State shall have adequate\n       access, would in fact defeat the value o f the wilderness bill,\n       assuming there were a very valuable mineral in a State\n       school section, and the State were to decide that it was\n       worth money to drive a road through the wilderness to\n       get to it. This would change the situation with respect to\n       existing law, because we would be imposing particular\n       restrictions, in spirit at least, with respect to access to the\n       land.\nId. (emphasis added).\n   Because of misunderstandings regarding the effect of the proposed\namendment on mineral lands, Senator Bennett withdrew the amend­\nment to allow time to confer with other Senators from western states.\nHe re-offered the amendment the following day, with minor changes\nnot relevant here. 107 Cong. Rec. 18,384 (1961). Senator Church, who\nearlier had expressed reservations about the amendment, now voiced\nhis support. In his brief remarks, he stated:\n       I think the amendment is fair to the States involved. If\n       they need rights of access, they should have them; if they\n       want to relinquish the land, they ought to have the right\n       to acquire other land of comparable value.\nId. Although we can infer from these remarks an understanding that\nthe section gives states the option of choosing access or exchange, the\nstatement does admit of other interpretations. In light of the evidence\nto the contrary, the resolution of this question cannot be rested on the\nremarks of one senator during debate on the Senate floor, where “the\nchoice of words . . . is not always accurate or exact.” In re Carlson,\n292 F. Supp. 778, 783 (C.D. Cal. 1968), citing United States v. Internat'l\n Union UAW-CIO, 352 U.S. 567, 585-86 (1957). If the Congress had\nintended to grant landowners a right to adequate access, it could have\ndone so expressly. Resolving the doubt in favor of the grantee of such a\nright would violate the well-established rule that any doubts as to\ncongressional grants of property interests must be resolved in favor of\nthe government. Andrus v. Charleston Stone Prod. Co., 436 U.S. 604, 617\n(1978); United States v. Union Pac. R.R., 353 U.S. 112, 116 (1957).\n   The Senate agreed to Senator Bennett’s amendment to S. 174, but\nS. 174 did not pass the House during the 87th Congress. A House\nversion of the bill did include a similar provision, also applicable only\nto state-owned land. The House report on this bill indicated that the\nsection required only that a state be given either access or exchange; it\ndid not indicate that the state could choose between them, or that\nadequate access otherwise was guaranteed. It stated:\n      If surrounded land is owned by a State, the State would\n      be given either right of access or opportunity of exchange.\n                                    52\n\f             . . . Ingress and egress would be provided for all valid\n             occupancies.\nH.R. Rep. No. 2521, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 108 (1962) (emphasis added).\n  Variations of Senator Bennett’s amendment appeared in both the\nSenate and House versions of the wilderness legislation in the 88th\nCongress. S. 4, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. § 3(j) (1963); H.R. 9070, 88th\nCong., 2d Sess. § 6(a) (1964). The Senate committee report on S. 4\nindicates that the understanding that states could be denied access and\noffered a land exchange as indemnity remained unchanged:\n                Section 3(j) provides that where State inholdings exist\n             in wilderness areas, the State shall be afforded access, or\n             shall be given Federal lands in exchange of equal value.\n               The amendment is an attempt to clarify the intention of\n             the Senate in regard to section 3(j), which was originally\n             proposed, withdrawn, revised, again proposed and\n             adopted during floor consideration of S. 174 in 1962 [sic].\n             The amended section represents a more deliberate and\n             careful drafting and consideration.\nS. Rep. No. 109, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 10, 21 (1963).\n   The House modified this section to include “privately owned land”\nin the first paragraph regarding “adequate access,” rather than in the\nsecond paragraph regarding “ingress and egress.” This modification is\nnot explained in the House report. See H.R. Rep. No. 1538, 88th Cong.,\n2d Sess. 13 (1963). The change was discussed in both the Senate and\nHouse hearings, however. The sentiment expressed was that private\nowners should have the same rights as the States. National Wilderness\nPreservation Act: Hearings on H.R. 9070, H.R. 9162, S. 4 and Related\nBills, Before the Subcomm. on Public Lands o f the House Comm, on\nInterior and Insular Affairs, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 1369-72 (1963). Both\npublic witnesses and congressmen stated that ingress and egress was\nuncertain under both 16 U.S.C. §478 and the wilderness acts, and that\nthe same provision for exchange should be made for private owners as\nwas made for States. Id. There is no indication that this addition of\nprivately owned lands modified the purpose of the section as identified\nby Senator Bennett.\n   In sum, if uses are well-established prior to wilderness designation,\nthey may be permitted to continue.47 In addition, all existing private\n\n     47     S ectio n 4(d)(1) o f th e A c t, 16 U .S .C . § 1133(d)(1), p ro v id e s th a t th e “ use o f a irc ra ft o r m o to r ­\nb o ats, w h e re th e se uses h av e a lre a d y b e c o m e esta b lish e d , m ay be p e rm itte d to c o n tin u e su b je c t to su ch\nre stric tio n s as th e S e c re ta ry o f A g ric u ltu re d ee m s d e s ira b le .” T h e c o m m itte e re p o rts rev ea l an in ten t\nth a t o th e r w ell-estab lish ed uses also be p e rm itte d to c o n tin u e .

As a result of § 5(a), therefore, the inholder\nactually may possess more access “rights” than were possessed prior to\nwilderness designation. If the landowner rejects an offer of land ex­\nchange, he may retain title to the inholding and exercise access rights\nconsistent with wilderness uses, or he may consent to acquisition of his\nland by the federal government.\n   These responses to the questions you have asked should provide\nsatisfactory guidance in your performance of your federal land manage­\nment responsibilities.\n\n                                        Sincerely,\n                                        B e n ja m in   R.

Your letter poses the following questions:\n   (1) Whether the Organic Act of June 4, 1897,1 grants to private\nlandowners,2 other than actual settlers, a right of ingress to and egress\nfrom their properties located within the exterior boundaries of the\nnational forests, or whether you may deny such access;\n   (2) W hether private landowners with property located within the\nexterior boundaries of the national forests have a right-of-way across\nnational forest lands by implied easement or easement by necessity\nenforceable against the federal government; and, if so, whether this\nright-of-way is limited to those instances in which the United States by\nits conveyance created a situation in which nonfederal lands are sur­\nrounded by public lands;\n   (3) Whether, if a right-of-way exists across national forests, it has\nbeen modified by:\n                 (a) The Organic Act of June 4, 1897, 16 U.S.C. § 478;\n                 (b) The Wilderness Act, § 5(a), 16 U.S.C. § 1134(a);\n                 (c) The Act of October 13, 1964, 16 U.S.C. §§ 532-538;\n\n    1A c t o f J u n e 4. 1897, c h . 2. § 1. 30 S tat. 36 (c o d ifie d at 16 U .S .C . § 478).\n    - A s used in th is o p in io n , th e te rm “ p riv a te la n d o w n e rs \" re fe rs to all n o n fe d e ra l la n d o w n e rs unless\no th e r w is e in d icated .\n\n\n                                                                    30\n\f                (d) The Montana Wilderness Study Act of 1977, § 3, 16 U.S.C.\n              § 1132 note; or\n                (e) Any other statute; and\n   (4)   Whether § 5(a) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. § 1134(a), au­\nthorizes you to deny access and offer as indemnity an exchange of\nnational forest land for private land, or whether the private landowner\nmay insist on a right of access.\n   I conclude, first, that the Organic Act of June 4, 1897, does not grant\na right of access to owners of land surrounded by national forests, other\nthan actual settlers, and that you have discretionary authority to deny\nsuch access, provided that a right of access does not otherwise exist. Of\ncourse, access cannot be denied arbitrarily.\n   Second, in my opinion, the common law doctrine of easement by\nnecessity does not apply to land owned by the federal government. A\nright of access may be implied from the terms of a federal land grant\nonly if Congress intended to grant the right. This intent may be show\nfrom the circumstances surrounding the grant, including the purpose\nfor which it was made.\n   Third, none of the statutes you have asked us to consider, nor any\nothers that we have found, would modify such a right in any case in\nwhich it is found to exist.\n   Fourth, I conclude that, absent a prior existing access right, you may\ndeny “adequate access” under the Wilderness Act, but you must offer a\nland exchange as indemnity.\n\n                                                                        I.\n\n  Your first question is whether Congress has given private inholders 3\na statutory right of ingress and egress with respect to their property,\nincluding a right to build roads. Congress clearly has the power to\ngrant such statutory rights.4 The question is whether it has done so.\n  Your department concludes that the Organic Act of June 4, 1897,\ngrants a right of access, including a right to build roads, to all owners\n\n     3 A n “ in h o ld e r\" is a la n d o w n e r w h o se p ro p e rty is c o m p le te ly s u rro u n d e d b y p r o p e r ty o w n e d b y\nth e U n ited S tates.

Section 478, the codifi­\ncation of § 1 of the Act, provides:\n              Nothing in sections 473 to 478, 479 to 482 and 551 of this\n              title shall be construed as prohibiting the egress or ingress\n              of actual settlers residing within the boundaries of na­\n              tional forests, or from crossing the same to and from their\n              property or homes; and such wagon roads and other im­\n              provements may be constructed thereon as may be neces­\n              sary to reach their homes and to utilize their property\n              under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by\n              the Secretary of Agriculture. Nor shall anything in such\n              sections prohibit any person from entering upon such na­\n              tional forests for all proper and lawful purposes, including\n              that of prospecting, locating, and developing the mineral\n              resources thereof. Such persons must comply with the\n              rules and regulations covering such national forests.\n   In 1962, Attorney General Kennedy was asked by the Secretary of\nAgriculture for his opinion on the meaning of this statute. See 42 Op.\nA tt’y Gen. 127 (1962). Prior to 1962, your department interpreted the\nfirst sentence of § 478 as granting a right of access to all owners of land\nsurrounded by a national forest. It reasoned that the term “ingress and\negress” included the construction of wagon roads, and that the term\n“actual settlers” included any person or corporation owning property\nwithin the boundaries of national forests. As a result, private landown­\ners, including lumber corporations, were considered to have a statutory\nright to build logging roads. Id. at 130. Attorney General Kennedy\nopined that the term “actual settlers” includes original settlers who\nreside on the land, and excludes corporations and other business enti­\nties.5 He further concluded that the Secretary of Agriculture has discre­\ntionary authority to impose a reciprocity requirement on requests by\ninholders, other than actual settlers, to use existing roads or to build\nnew roads within national forests. Id. at 142-45.\n   You have advised us that, notwithstanding the 1962 opinion, your\ndepartment has continued to maintain that § 478 creates a right of\naccess for all private inholders. This interpretation, you have informed\nus, has been based upon the second sentence of § 478, which was not\ndirectly addressed in the 1962 opinion. My review of the reasoning set\nforth in that earlier opinion, as well as my analysis of § 478 and its\nlegislative history, convinces me that no such access right exists.\n   The 1962 opinion analyzed § 478 by dividing it into the following\nthree categories: (1) ingress and egress of actual settlers; (2) construc­\n\n     5      B etw e en th e e x tre m e s o f th e o rig in a l s e ttle r a n d c o r p o ra tio n s o r b usiness e n titie s a re in te rm e d ia ry\nty p e s o f p ro p e rty o w n e rs su c h as h e irs o r assigns o f an a c tu a l s e ttle r.

Id. at 127, 138-39. We are concerned here only with the third\ncategory because you inquire as to the rights of landowners other than\nactual settlers. In this category, “entry upon” may be subdivided into\nentry by mere ingress and egress, in particular the use of existing roads,\nand entry requiring construction of roads. Section 478 provides that\nany entry upon the forest reserve by any person is subject to the rules\nand regulations covering such national forests. The question now pre­\nsented, therefore, is whether the Secretary’s regulations may, in appro­\npriate cases, include denial of the requested entry.\n    To determine correctly the scope of rights protected by the 1897\nAct, it is necessary to study carefully the language of the Act itself, and\nits legislative history. As the legislative history is fully summarized in\nthe 1962 opinion, I note only the aspects particularly relevant here. At\nthe outset, it is helpful to review the sequence of events which led to\nthe passage of the Act. During the 1800’s the public entered freely\nupon federal land, and Congress, although it did not provide specific\nlegal authority for most uses of the public domain, made no serious\nattempt to halt such uses. See generally G. Robinson, The Forest Serv­\nice 2-5 (1978); Clawson & Held, The Federal Lands 46 (1957). This\ntacit approval constituted an open invitation to the public to avail itself\nof the federal land without specific authorization. Most people assumed\nthat the United States was a temporary titleholder and that the land\nwould eventually pass into private ownership. See R. Robbins, Our\nLanded Heritage: The Public Domain, 1776-1970, 5-6 (1976). The\npublic land laws of the era, including preemption laws,6 homestead\nlaws,7 and mining laws,8 presumed unimpeded access to the public\ndomain.\n   This policy of unimpeded access was recognized by the Supreme\nCourt in Buford v. Houtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92673\"><a href=\"/opinion/92673/buford-v-houtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326 (1890), a case in which the\nCourt considered the complaints of owners of alternate odd-numbered\nsections of land that sheepowners were damaging their land by driving\n\n     6T h e A c t o f M ay 29, 1830, 4 S tal. 4 2 0 -2 1 , first g ra n te d p re e m p tio n rig h ts to settlers.

Presidential Proclamations Nos. 19-31,\nFeb. 22, 1897, 29 Stat. 893-912. Within the boundaries of the reserves\nwere villages, patented mining claims, homestead claims of actual set­\ntlers and other developments. See 30 Cong. Rec. 901-02 (1897). Each of\nthe proclamations contained the following admonition: “Warning is\nhereby expressly given to all persons not to enter or make settlement\nupon the tract of land reserved by this proclamation.” See, e.g., 29 Stat.\n894 (1897). The proclamations also prohibited the general use of timber\non the reserves, and jeopardized other theretofore legitimate activities\nof persons living within or near the reserves.\n   Congressmen from states affected by the proclamations expressed\noutrage at what they considered the President’s hasty and ill-advised\naction. 30 Cong. Rec. 902 (1897). This reaction culminated in the\npassage of an amendment to the Sundry Civil Expense Appropriation\nAct, 30 Stat. 36 (1897). This amendment was designed to solve the\n“difficulties surrounding these forest reservations” (id. at 900) and to\nprovide for “administering the forest so reserved” (id. at 909).11 Senator\nCarter of Montana explained that the amendment was offered “not for\nthe purpose of benefitting any particular individual or class of individ­\nuals, but for the purpose of permitting existing communities in the\nUnited States to enjoy the privileges which have ordinarily been ac­\ncorded to the pioneer settlers on the frontier everywhere.” Id. at 902.\nOther Senators also criticized the provision prohibiting entry or settle­\nment upon the reserves. Id. at 910-11. Senator Allison of Iowa stated:\n“[I]f segregations are made I think every interest existing at the time,\nhowever remote it may be, should be protected.” Id. at 911 (emphasis\nadded). The House debate on the amendment indicates that the con­\ngressmen also were concerned about preserving existing uses of the\nforest reserves. Id. at 1007-13 (remarks of Representatives Castle,\nKnowles, Lacy, and DeVries).12\n   The bill was referred to a conference committee, which reported the\nbill without changes in or comments upon the access section. Id. at\n1242-43. During the Senate debate on the conference report, some of\nthe same western Senators on whose behalf the amendment was intro­\nduced sought to change the clause “actual settlers residing within the\nboundaries of national forests” to “bona fide settlers or owners within a\nreservation.” Id. at 1278-81.

Id. at 1278. The amendment was defeated.\nId. at 1285. Opponents of the amendment emphasized that there was no\nintent to deprive any person of access to his property, and that “what­\never rights have been acquired as respects the public lands under the\npublic land laws are reserved and preserved.” Id. at 1283. It was noted\nthat entry upon the forests was subject to the rules and regulations of\nthe Secretary of Interior (who then had this administrative authority)\nand that such rules would not likely prevent access to a person’s home.\nId. at 1280 (remarks of Senator Berry). Notwithstanding the concession\nthat the bill was “imperfect,” the conference report was agreed to. It\nwas pointed out that further amendment would cause substantial delay\nand that any evils could be corrected by subsequent legislation. Id. at\n 1282—83. The House adopted the conference report without debate on\nthis provision. Id. at 1397-401.\n   This legislative history demonstrates that the effect of the second\nsentence of § 478 is to protect whatever rights and licenses with regard\nto the public domain existed prior to the reservation. We interpret the\nprovision as a congressional declaration that the establishment of forest\nreserves would not alter the long-standing policy of allowing\nunimpeded access to the public land or interfere with the rights of\npersons then using the land, not as an affirmative grant of a broad right\nof entry to all persons. The express language of the statute provides\nthat nothing in the act shall be construed to prohibit certain activities.\nThe language grants no rights not already in existence. See Robbins,\nsupra, at 323; John Ise, The United States Forest Policy 140 (1920).\n   The protection of “lawful” and “proper” entry upon the reserves\ncannot be construed to limit congressional authority to regulate such\nentry. No vested right to use the public domain for a particular purpose\narises from the government’s mere acquiescence in such use.

Both statutes authorize the Secretary\nto protect the forest lands.13\n  This interpretation is consistent with the 1962 opinion of the A ttor­\nney G eneral.14 His review of the legislative history of §478 disclosed a\nlegislative desire to protect explicitly only the rights of ingress and\negress of actual settlers. 42 Op.

The imposition of harsh and oner­\n           ous requirements not related to the benefit received or to\n           your general responsibility to preserve and manage the\n           national forests, might well constitute an abuse of\n           discretion.\n42 Op. A tt’y Gen. at 147.\n   Your department argues that it has a long-standing policy that the\nSecretary is without discretion to deny access under § 478, and that a\nchange in this policy would have a drastic effect on the well-established\nexpectations of landowners within the national forests. It is a familiar\nprinciple that interpretations made contemporaneously with the enact­\nment of a statute and consistently followed for a long period are\nentitled to great weight, particularly if they have been relied on by the\npublic.

Prior to 1962,\nyour department relied on the first sentence of § 478 to find the same\nrights you now find in the second sentence. This 1962 revision of the\ndepartment’s interpretation occurred almost 70 years after enactment of\nthe statute.15\n   In any case, to the extent that my judgment is governed by the\ncustomary rules of statutory construction, I am guided by the overrid­\ning rule that the statute, and not the agency’s interpretation, is conclu­\nsive. See, e.g., VolksWagenwerk v. Federal Maritime Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107628\"><a href=\"/opinion/107628/volkswagenwerk-aktiengesellschaft-v-federal-maritime-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1968). Additionally, I am persuaded by the legislative\nhistory and by the common sense rule that legislative history disclosing\nCongress’ intent is entitled to more weight than a conflicting adminis­\ntrative interpretation and must control. See Norwegian Nitrogen Products\nCo. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102037\"><a href=\"/opinion/102037/norwegian-nitrogen-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (1933); Sutherland, Statutes and\nStatutory Construction §49.04 (1973 & Supp. 1975).\n   In sum, I conclude that § 478 does not grant access rights to private\ninholders other than actual settlers. In my opinion, absent a right of\naccess otherwise granted to the landowner by Congress, you may deny\nrequested access if such denial will protect the public interest in the\n\n     14 In S oriano v. U nited States. 494 F .2 d 681, 683 (9 th C ir. 1974), th e c o u r t d e c lin e d to g iv e sp ecial\nd e fe re n c e to a re g u la tio n p ro m u lg a te d m o re th a n 100 y ea rs a fte r e n a c tm e n t o f th e statu te.\n\n\n                                                            38\n\f land to be traversed. Because you may not arbitrarily deny access to\n private landowners, I do not foresee that this interpretation will have a\n drastic effect on their expectations.\n\n                                                                        II.\n\n    Your second question is whether an inholder has an easement by\n necessity or other implied easement across national forest land. The\n conclusion in Part I (that § 478 does not grant a right of access to\n private property across national forest reserves, and that, absent an\naccess right otherwise guaranteed to a landowner by Congress, § 478\nallows denial of access) renders apparent the importance of this\nquestion.\n    In the 1962 opinion, the Attorney General stated that whether an\neasement by necessity lies against the government is a complex and\ncontroversial question. While he concluded that it need not be decided\nat that time, the Attorney General nonetheless offered his view that\nsuch an easement does not exist over public lands. 42 Op. A tt’y Gen.\n 127, 148. It is also my view that the common law doctrine of easement\nby necessity does not apply to congressional disposition of the public\ndomain. This does not mean, however, that access cannot otherwise be\nimplied. In my opinion, access may be implied if it is necessary to\neffectuate the purpose for which the land was granted.\n    The doctrine of easement by necessity is a common law property\nconcept that was recently described by the Supreme Court as follows:\n“Where a private landowner conveys to another individual a portion of\nhis lands in a certain area and retains the rest, it is presumed at common\nlaw that the grantor has reserved an easement to pass over the granted\nproperty if such passage is necessary to reach the retained property.”\nLeo Sheep Co. v.

This is the\nunity-of-title requirement. Second, the unity of title must have been\nsevered by a conveyance of one of the tracts. Third, the easement must\nbe necessary in order for the owner of the dominant tenement to use\nhis land. This necessity must exist both at the time of the severance of\ntitle and at the time of application for the exercise of the easement.18\n\n     16 In L eo Sheep, th e C o u rt c o n s id e re d th e q u estio n w h e th e r th e U n ite d S ta te s h ad re s e rv e d an\nea sem en t to pass o v e r lan d s w h ic h h ad passed fro m fed eral o w n e rs h ip .

It\nreasoned:\n            Under the Constitution Congress has the authority and\n            responsibility to manage Federal land. U.S. Const, art. IV,\n            § 3, cl. 2. . . . There is nothing in the school land grant\n            program that would indicate that when Congress devel­\n            oped the school land grant scheme it intended to abrogate\n            its right to control activity on Federal land. Further, it is\n            consistent with common law property principles to find\n            that the United States, as the holder of the servient tene­\n            ment, has the right to limit the location and use of Utah’s\n            easement of access to that which is necessary for the\n            state’s reasonable enjoyment of its right. . . . Thus, the\n            court holds that, although the State of Utah or its lessee\n            must be allowed access to section 36, the United States\n            may regulate the manner of access under statutes such as\n            FLPMA.\nSlip Op. at 21.\n   Cases like Superior Oil, Kinscherff, and Utah v. Andrus lend support\nto my conclusions with respect to implied rights to access across\nfederal land. While the common law easement by necessity does not\nrun against the United States, a right to access may nonetheless be\nimplied by reference to particular grants. And, to the extent that such\nimplied rights exist, your broad authority—delegated to you by Con­\ngress—to manage forest reserves empowers you to regulate their exer­\ncise. See United States v.

As set forth above, this\ndetermination depends on when the grant was made and for what\npurpose. Mindful of the goal of giving effect to legislative intent, you\nmust look to the rules the Supreme Court has adopted for interpretation\nof federal land grants. As discussed previously, land grants generally\nare to be strictly construed. This rule must be balanced against the\nconflicting rule that in some situations, certain types of land grants may\ndeserve a more liberal construction because of the circumstances sur­\nrounding passage of the statutes in question.

Of particular con­\ncern are the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C. §§1131-1136, and various\nwilderness study acts.32 See, e.g., Montana Wilderness Study Act of\n1977, Pub. L. No. 95-150, 91 Stat. 1243; Sheep Mtn. and Snow Mtn.\nWilderness Areas, et al., Pub. L. No. 94-557, § 3, 90 Stat. 2635 (1976).\nThese wilderness study acts require you to exercise your discretion so\nas to preserve the wilderness character of the land.33 If a request for a\nparticular mode of access would destroy that wilderness character,\ntherefore, you must deny the request. These acts also provide, how­\never, that their mandates are subject to “existing private rights.” 34 See,\ne.g., Montana Wilderness Study Act, § 3(a), 16 U.S.C. § 1132 note. You\nmust determine, therefore, what implied access rights are guaranteed in\na particular grant, and allow the exercise of those rights.

The Organic Act of 1897, 16 U.S.C. §478, discussed at length in\nPart I of this opinion, preserves access rights existing at the time of\ncreation of a forest reserve. The Act of October 13, 1964, 16 U.S.C.\n532-538, which authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to grant ease­\nments for road rights-of-way over lands administered by the Forest\nService,35 was passed in reaction to Attorney General Kennedy’s 1962\ninterpretation of 16 U.S.C. §478, which, as discussed earlier, allowed\nthe imposition of a reciprocity requirement with respect to rights-of-\nway. By empowering the Secretary of Agriculture to grant permanent\neasements, the Congress hoped to provide an alternative to statutory\nassurance of access to and from private inholdings.36 Thus, the statute\ndoes not substantively modify implied rights of access. It does, along\nwith FLPMA, allow the imposition of certain procedural requirements,\nsuch as application for a permit prior to road construction. We have\nfound no other statute that substantively modifies implied access rights.\n\n                                                                    IV.\n\n   Your final question concerns § 5(a) of the Wilderness Act, 16 U.S.C.\n1134(a). Your department has concluded that this provision guarantees\na private owner “adequate access” to an inholding unless the land­\nowner voluntarily chooses a land exchange. Pursuant to this interpreta­\ntion, regulations have been promulgated providing that access “shall be\ngiven.” 37 The Department of the Interior has taken the position that\n§ 5(a) grants the Secretary of the Interior (and, by analogy, the Secre­\ntary of Agriculture) the authority to deny access to a landowner, and\n\n   3516 U .S .C . § 533.

The\npurpose of the Wilderness Act is to “secure for the American people of\npresent and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of\nwilderness.” 16 U.S.C. § 1131(a). “Wilderness” is defined as an area of\n“undeveloped Federal land retaining its primeval character and influ­\nence, without permanent improvements or human habitation.” 16\nU.S.C. § 1131(c). Section 4(c) of the Act prohibits, with limited excep­\ntions, use of motor vehicles or other mechanical transportation. 16\nU.S.C. § 1133(c). It also prohibits permanent roads within any wilder­\nness area, except as specifically provided in the Act, and subject to\n“existing private rights.” Id. The Act directs you to administer wilder­\nness areas within your jurisdiction so as to preserve their wilderness\ncharacter. 16 U.S.C. § 1133(b). The phrase “existing private rights” in\n§ 4(c), 16 U.S.C. § 1133(c), is not defined in the Act or in its legislative\nhistory, but, in my opinion, includes existing easements, which are well-\nrecognized rights in property.39 Thus, in spite of the A ct’s general\nprohibitions, if a private inholder has an implied right to a particular\ntype of access, that right is preserved.\n   The Wilderness Act was developed over a 15-year period, with\nalmost unprecedented citizen participation. See S. Rep. No. 109, 88th\nCong., 1st Sess. 7 (1963). The first major wilderness bill was introduced\nin the 85th Congress. S. 1176, 85th Cong., 1st Sess. (1957). In 1961, the\nSenate passed a wilderness bill, S. 174, but the House failed to pass it.\n\n     38 S u p p le m e n ta l M e m o ra n d u m In S u p p o rt o f P la in tifT s M o tio n fo r P e rm a n e n t In ju n c tio n , at 14-19,\n U n ited S ta tes v.

It was identical to\nS. 174, with one exception not relevant here. It passed the Senate by a\nlarge margin (110 Cong. Rec. 17,458 (1964)), but was amended in the\nHouse (110 Cong. Rec. 17,461 (1964)). A conference committee was\nconvened and adopted with few amendments the House version of the\nbill, H.R. 9070. See H.R. Rep. No. 1829, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. (1964).\nThe conference bill was approved by both Houses (110 Cong. Rec.\n20,603, 20,632 (1964)) and signed by the President on September 3,\n1964.\n   Section 5(a) of the Act deals with state and private property com­\npletely surrounded by wilderness areas. It provides:\n               In any case where State-owned or privately owned land\n            is completely surrounded by national forest lands within\n            areas designated by this chapter as wilderness, such State\n            or private owner shall be given such rights as may be\n            necessary to assure adequate access to such State-owned\n            or privately owned land by such State or private owner\n            and their successors in interest, or the State-owned land\n            or privately owned land shall be exchanged for federally\n            owned land in the same State of approximately equal\n            value under authorities available to the Secretary of Agri­\n            culture: Provided, however, that the United States shall\n            not transfer to a State or private owner any mineral\n            interests unless the State or private owner relinquishes or\n            causes to be relinquished to the United States the mineral\n            interest in the surrounded land.\nSince the enactment of the Wilderness Act, your department has inter­\npreted this language to preserve the statutory right of access you found\nin 16 U.S.C. § 478.40 Because, in my opinion, §478 does not grant a\nright of access to inholders other than actual settlers, the question\npresented here is whether § 5(a) grants to inholders a broad right of\n“adequate access” beyond any existing private rights. I believe it does\nnot.\n   The term “adequate access” is not defined in the Act, but the legisla­\ntive history makes clear that the term includes access not consistent\nwith wilderness uses.41 For example, in both the Senate and House\n\n    40S ee n o te 37 supra.\n    41       O th e r sectio n s a p p ly to uses c o n s is te n t w ith w ild e rn e ss p re s e rv a tio n .

See, e.g., 107 Cong. Rec. 18,105 (1961); 109 Cong. Rec.\n5,925-26 (1963). Accordingly, your regulation defining “adequate\naccess” does not limit access to established uses or to means consistent\nwith wilderness uses. It includes access which “will serve the reason­\nable purposes for which the state and private land is held or used.” 42\nWhat constitutes adequate access will depend on the facts and circum­\nstances o f each case, and is a determination left to your discretion.\n   The Act requires that the state or private inholder be given such\nrights as are necessary to assure adequate access, or that the land be\nexchanged for federally owned land of approximately equal value. The\nlanguage of § 5(a) indicates that a landowner has a right to access or\nexchange. If he is offered either,, he has been accorded all the rights\ngranted by the statute. If you offer land exchange, the landowner has\nno right of access under § 5(a). This interpretation is supported by the\nlegislative history of the section.43\n   The language of § 5(a) first appeared in an amendment to S. 174, 87th\nCong., 1st Sess. (1961). Senator Bennett of Utah proposed the amend­\nment in response to concerns of the Western Association of State Land\nCommissioners, and, accordingly, the amendment pertained only to\nstate-owned land. 107 Cong. Rec. 18,092 (1961).44 The Senator identi­\nfied a series of “loopholes” in the bill. He described the 13th loophole\nas follows: “No provision is made in S. 174 to preserve the right of\n\no c c u p a n c ie s.

This should certainly be\ndone or alternatively, the States should be permitted to choose Federal\nlands in another location in lieu of the land isolated within wilderness\nareas.” Id. The choice referred to by Senator Bennett was the choice of\nlands if access were denied, not the choice of either access or exchange.\nHe stated that the purpose of his amendment was to “give the States\naccess to State lands within wilderness areas established under the bill,\nor indemnify the States for loss of such access.” 107 Cong. Rec. 18,103\n(1961). He did not indicate that a state could choose between access\nand indemnity. His amendment provided in part:\n          In any case where State-owned land is completely sur­\n       rounded by lands incorporated into the wilderness system\n       such State shall be given (1) such rights as may be neces­\n       sary to assure adequate access to such State-owned land\n       by such State and its successors in interest, or (2) land in\n       the same State, not exceeding the value of the surrounded\n       land, in exchange for the surrounded land. Exchanges of\n       land under the provisions of this subsection shall be ac­\n       complished in the manner provided for the exchange of\n       lands in national forests.\n107 Cong. Rec. 18,103 (1961). In urging support of his amendment,\nSenator Bennett explained:45\n      [T]he Western Association of State Land Commissioners\n      unanimously adopted a resolution calling for indemnifica­\n      tion to the States which will lose access to State lands in\n      wilderness areas established under S. 174. Where State\n      school sections or other State lands are isolated by wilder­\n      ness areas, the State should be given an opportunity, if\n      access is denied, to make in lieu selections of Federal lands\n      in other areas.\nId. (emphasis added).46 These statements demonstrate that Senator\nBennett believed that access not consistent with wilderness preservation\ncould be denied, and wanted to give states an alternative in such\ncircumstances.\n   The Senator later explained that his amendment was designed to\ncorrect problems states had experienced with land exchanges in the\npast. 107 Cong. Rec. 18,105 (1961). He wanted to ensure that if the\nstate land was “locked up,” the state clearly would be entitled to an\nexchange. He further explained:\n\n     45 A u th o rity to e x c h a n g e land is p ro v id e d by 16 U .S .C . § § 4 8 5 , 486 (o rig in a lly e n a c te d as A c t o f\nM ar. 20, 1922, c h . 105, 42 S tat. 465) an d 16 U .S .C . § 516 (o rig in a lly e n a c te d as A c t o f M ar. 3, 1925,\nch . 473, 43 S tat. 1215).\n     46 H is b e lie f th a t a c cess to sta te -o w n e d lan d s m a y be d e n ie d e n tire ly m a y resu lt in p a rt fro m th e\nla n g u a g e o f § 4 (c ) , 16 U .S .C . § 1133(c), w h ic h s p ecifically p ro te c te d o n ly ex istin g priva te rig h ts.

This would change the situation with respect to\n       existing law, because we would be imposing particular\n       restrictions, in spirit at least, with respect to access to the\n       land.\nId. (emphasis added).\n   Because of misunderstandings regarding the effect of the proposed\namendment on mineral lands, Senator Bennett withdrew the amend­\nment to allow time to confer with other Senators from western states.\nHe re-offered the amendment the following day, with minor changes\nnot relevant here. 107 Cong. Rec. 18,384 (1961). Senator Church, who\nearlier had expressed reservations about the amendment, now voiced\nhis support. In his brief remarks, he stated:\n       I think the amendment is fair to the States involved. If\n       they need rights of access, they should have them; if they\n       want to relinquish the land, they ought to have the right\n       to acquire other land of comparable value.\nId. Although we can infer from these remarks an understanding that\nthe section gives states the option of choosing access or exchange, the\nstatement does admit of other interpretations. In light of the evidence\nto the contrary, the resolution of this question cannot be rested on the\nremarks of one senator during debate on the Senate floor, where “the\nchoice of words . . . is not always accurate or exact.” In re Carlson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2160087\"><a href=\"/opinion/2160087/in-re-carlson/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

A House\nversion of the bill did include a similar provision, also applicable only\nto state-owned land. The House report on this bill indicated that the\nsection required only that a state be given either access or exchange; it\ndid not indicate that the state could choose between them, or that\nadequate access otherwise was guaranteed. It stated:\n      If surrounded land is owned by a State, the State would\n      be given either right of access or opportunity of exchange.\n                                    52\n\f             . . . Ingress and egress would be provided for all valid\n             occupancies.\nH.R. Rep. No. 2521, 87th Cong., 2d Sess. 108 (1962) (emphasis added).\n  Variations of Senator Bennett’s amendment appeared in both the\nSenate and House versions of the wilderness legislation in the 88th\nCongress. S. 4, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. § 3(j) (1963); H.R. 9070, 88th\nCong., 2d Sess. § 6(a) (1964). The Senate committee report on S. 4\nindicates that the understanding that states could be denied access and\noffered a land exchange as indemnity remained unchanged:\n                Section 3(j) provides that where State inholdings exist\n             in wilderness areas, the State shall be afforded access, or\n             shall be given Federal lands in exchange of equal value.\n               The amendment is an attempt to clarify the intention of\n             the Senate in regard to section 3(j), which was originally\n             proposed, withdrawn, revised, again proposed and\n             adopted during floor consideration of S. 174 in 1962 [sic].\n             The amended section represents a more deliberate and\n             careful drafting and consideration.\nS. Rep. No. 109, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. 10, 21 (1963).\n   The House modified this section to include “privately owned land”\nin the first paragraph regarding “adequate access,” rather than in the\nsecond paragraph regarding “ingress and egress.” This modification is\nnot explained in the House report. See H.R. Rep. No. 1538, 88th Cong.,\n2d Sess. 13 (1963). The change was discussed in both the Senate and\nHouse hearings, however. The sentiment expressed was that private\nowners should have the same rights as the States. National Wilderness\nPreservation Act: Hearings on H.R. 9070, H.R. 9162, S. 4 and Related\nBills, Before the Subcomm. on Public Lands o f the House Comm, on\nInterior and Insular Affairs, 88th Cong., 2d Sess. 1369-72 (1963). Both\npublic witnesses and congressmen stated that ingress and egress was\nuncertain under both 16 U.S.C. §478 and the wilderness acts, and that\nthe same provision for exchange should be made for private owners as\nwas made for States. Id. There is no indication that this addition of\nprivately owned lands modified the purpose of the section as identified\nby Senator Bennett.\n   In sum, if uses are well-established prior to wilderness designation,\nthey may be permitted to continue.47 In addition, all existing private\n\n     47     S ectio n 4(d)(1) o f th e A c t, 16 U .S .C . § 1133(d)(1), p ro v id e s th a t th e “ use o f a irc ra ft o r m o to r ­\nb o ats, w h e re th e se uses h av e a lre a d y b e c o m e esta b lish e d , m ay be p e rm itte d to c o n tin u e su b je c t to su ch\nre stric tio n s as th e S e c re ta ry o f A g ric u ltu re d ee m s d e s ira b le .” T h e c o m m itte e re p o rts rev ea l an in ten t\nth a t o th e r w ell-estab lish ed uses also be p e rm itte d to c o n tin u e .

Even if the landowner has no prior\nexisting right to access not consistent with wilderness uses, the Wilder­\nness Act requires that “adequate access” be given or that an offer be\nmade to the landowner to exchange the land for federal land of ap­\nproximately equal value. As a result of § 5(a), therefore, the inholder\nactually may possess more access “rights” than were possessed prior to\nwilderness designation. If the landowner rejects an offer of land ex­\nchange, he may retain title to the inholding and exercise access rights\nconsistent with wilderness uses, or he may consent to acquisition of his\nland by the federal government.\n   These responses to the questions you have asked should provide\nsatisfactory guidance in your performance of your federal land manage­\nment responsibilities.\n\n                                        Sincerely,\n                                        B e n ja m in   R.
