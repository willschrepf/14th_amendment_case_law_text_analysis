For the following reasons, we will affirm.\n\f                                              I.\n\n       Colon is currently confined in the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg,\n\nPennsylvania (“USP-Lewisburg”). On December 29, 2003, Colon attempted to smuggle\n\nnarcotics into the prison by swallowing four balloons of heroin. One of the balloons burst\n\ninside of Colon, however, causing him to lose consciousness. Colon was taken to the\n\nhospital, where he vomited two of the balloons and passed the one that remained intact.\n\nThe substance in the balloons subsequently tested positive for opiates/morphine, as did\n\nColon’s urine sample.\n\n       On January 12, 2004, Colon was served with Incident Report No. 1180286,\n\ncharging him with use of narcotics in violation of Disciplinary Code Section 112. The\n\nincident report was referred to the Unit Discipline Committee (“UDC”), which held a\n\nhearing the next day, January 13, 2004. At the hearing, the UDC informed Colon that,\n\nbecause of the seriousness of the offense, the matter was being referred to the prison\n\nDisciplinary Hearing Officer (“DHO”). At that time, Colon received written notice of his\n\nrights, and he indicated that he did not wish to have a staff representative present at the\n\nhearing.\n\n       Approximately two weeks later, on January 26, 2004, Colon appeared for a hearing\n\nbefore DHO Kevin Bittenbender. At the hearing, Colon admitted the charges against\n\nhim, explaining that “a balloon had broke [sic] inside me when I tried to smuggle heroin\n\nthrough the visiting room.” Colon did not present any witnesses or other evidence in\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fsupport of his case. Following the hearing, the DHO issued a written decision finding\n\nColon guilty of the charged offense. The DHO subsequently imposed the following\n\nsanctions: disallowance of 54 days of good conduct time; 60 days of disciplinary\n\nsegregation; five-year loss of phone privileges; seven-year loss of visiting privileges; a\n\ntwo-year loss of commissary privileges; and a disciplinary transfer. The DHO also\n\nreferred the matter to the FBI for possible criminal prosecution.\n\n                                               II.\n\n         On September 11, 2007, Colon filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 alleging that his due process rights had been violated during\n\nthe disciplinary process.1 Specifically, Colon claimed that: (1) pursuant to 28 C.F.R. §\n\n541.14(b)(1), the proceedings should not have begun until the FBI released the case for\n\nadministrative action; (2) he received inadequate notice of the charges in violation of 28\n\nC.F.R. § 541.11; and (3) there was insufficient evidence to support the DHO’s finding.\n\nBy order entered July 1, 2008, the District Court denied the petition. Colon now appeals\n\nfrom the District Court’s order.\n\n                                              III.\n\n         We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a).\n\nWe review a District Court’s denial of habeas corpus relief de novo. Marshall v.\n\nHendricks, 307 F.3d 36, 50 (3d Cir. 2002). We review the District Court’s factual\n\n\n\n  1\n      Colon exhausted his administrative remedies before initiating the present action.\n\n                                               3\n\ffindings for clear error. See, e.g., Ruggiano v. Reish, 307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir. 2002)\n\n(“In reviewing a federal habeas judgment, ‘we exercise plenary review over the district\n\ncourt’s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.’”)\n\n(quoting Rios v. Wiley, 201 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir. 2000)).\n\n       It is well established that “prison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal\n\nprosecution and the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceedings does not\n\napply.” Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974). The Supreme Court has,\n\nhowever, recognized a set of minimum procedural protections that must apply to prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings when, as in this case, a prisoner’s good-time credit is at stake.2\n\nId. Specifically, when good-time credit is at stake, a prisoner is entitled to: (1) advance\n\nwritten notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with\n\ninstitutional safety or correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary\n\nevidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence\n\nrelied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action. Id. at 563-67. “Revocation of good\n\ntime does not comport with the minimum requirements of procedural due process unless\n\nthe findings of the prison disciplinary board are supported by some evidence in the\n\n\n\n\n  2\n   While the Due Process Clause protects against the revocation of good-time credit, it\ndoes not provide the same level of protection against the other forms of discipline that\nColon received. See Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141, 150-51 (3d Cir. 2002) (citing\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995)).\n\n\n                                              4\n\frecord.” Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985) (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted).\n\n       Upon review, we agree with the District Court that Colon received all the process\n\nhe was due during the disciplinary proceedings. The record reveals that Colon was given\n\n24 hours’ notice of the charges against him in accordance with 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(a); that\n\nhe was provided the opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in\n\nhis defense; and that he was issued a written decision setting forth the evidence relied on,\n\nand reasons for, the disciplinary action. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67.\n\n       Furthermore, the DHO’s findings were clearly supported by “some” evidence in\n\nthe record. In his report, DHO Bittenbender noted that his decision was based upon the\n\nfollowing inculpatory evidence: the incident report; the toxicology report from Colon’s\n\nurine sample; a chain of custody form confirming that the urine belonged to Colon;\n\nColon’s medical file; a memorandum authored by the investigating officer; and Colon’s\n\nown admission of guilt. We agree with the District Court that this evidence is sufficient\n\nto support the outcome of the hearing, and meets the requirements imposed by the Due\n\nProcess Clause. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.3\n\n          Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s order denying Colon’s petition\n\nfor writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n  3\n   We need not reach Colon’s allegations that the prison failed to follow certain other\nBOP guidelines because, as discussed above, such failure will not result in a due process\nviolation as long as Colon was provided with the process he is due under Wolff.\n\n                                              5\n\f",

The Supreme Court has,\n\nhowever, recognized a set of minimum procedural protections that must apply to prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings when, as in this case, a prisoner’s good-time credit is at stake.2\n\nId. Specifically, when good-time credit is at stake, a prisoner is entitled to: (1) advance\n\nwritten notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity, when consistent with\n\ninstitutional safety or correctional goals, to call witnesses and present documentary\n\nevidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence\n\nrelied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.

The record reveals that Colon was given\n\n24 hours’ notice of the charges against him in accordance with 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(a); that\n\nhe was provided the opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in\n\nhis defense; and that he was issued a written decision setting forth the evidence relied on,\n\nand reasons for, the disciplinary action. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67.\n\n       Furthermore, the DHO’s findings were clearly supported by “some” evidence in\n\nthe record. In his report, DHO Bittenbender noted that his decision was based upon the\n\nfollowing inculpatory evidence: the incident report; the toxicology report from Colon’s\n\nurine sample; a chain of custody form confirming that the urine belonged to Colon;\n\nColon’s medical file; a memorandum authored by the investigating officer; and Colon’s\n\nown admission of guilt. We agree with the District Court that this evidence is sufficient\n\nto support the outcome of the hearing, and meets the requirements imposed by the Due\n\nProcess Clause. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.3\n\n          Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s order denying Colon’s petition\n\nfor writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n  3\n   We need not reach Colon’s allegations that the prison failed to follow certain other\nBOP guidelines because, as discussed above, such failure will not result in a due process\nviolation as long as Colon was provided with the process he is due under Wolff.\n\n                                              5\n\f</pre>",
