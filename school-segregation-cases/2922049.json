The district court had jurisdiction pur-\nsuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343 and 1367. We have jurisdic-\ntion under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we reverse and remand.\n\n   Marella, a prisoner at the Calipatria State Prison, filed a\ncomplaint against prison officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nalleging violations of his constitutional rights stemming from\na knife attack by his fellow inmates. Prison officials filed a\nmotion for summary judgment on grounds unrelated to\nexhaustion of administrative remedies. The magistrate judge\n(MJ) notified Marella under Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952\n(9th Cir. 1998) (en banc), that he was required to oppose the\nmotion with evidence. While the motion for summary judg-\nment was pending, the MJ requested that prison officials sup-\nplement their motion with information regarding whether\nMarella exhausted administrative remedies. The prison offi-\ncials took the position that Marella had not exhausted admin-\n\f                     MARELLA v. TERHUNE                   4319\nistrative remedies because his first formal grievance was\nuntimely filed.\n\n   Prior to filing his complaint in federal court, Marella had\nfiled a grievance within the prison system, which the prison\nrejected on procedural grounds. The history of Marella’s\nappeal within the prison system is key to whether he\nexhausted his administrative remedies, as required by the\nPLRA. Following the knife attack, Marella spent two days in\nthe hospital, subsequently moved to the infirmary, and finally,\nwas placed in administrative segregation. He contends that he\nwas unable to acquire and complete a grievance form during\nthat time. Following his release, thirty-three days after the\nknife attack, he filed his grievance regarding the knife attack\nwith the prison. This grievance was filed at the first formal\nlevel of review. The grievance was denied as untimely, and\nthe grievance form stated that he may only appeal the denial\nif the reason for the denial was inaccurate. Marella neverthe-\nless appealed the denial to the Director of Corrections (the\nthird and final level of review within the California prison\nsystem), and was informed that his appeal was rejected\nbecause he did not first complete a second level of review.\n\n   In the federal court proceeding, the MJ concluded that\nMarella had not exhausted administrative remedies because\nhis initial grievance was untimely filed, and determined that\nthere are no exceptions to the timely filing requirement. The\ndistrict court adopted the MJ’s Report and Recommendations,\nand also held that Marella failed to exhaust administrative\nremedies because he failed to appeal his grievance properly\nthrough the third and final level of the prison grievance sys-\ntem. The district court dismissed Marella’s complaint without\nprejudice.\n\n   [1] The MJ and the district court (through its adoption of\nthe MJ’s Report and Recommendation) erred in concluding\nthat, as a matter of law, no exceptions to the timely filing\nrequirement exist. Marella contends that he was unable to file\n\f4320                 MARELLA v. TERHUNE\nhis grievance timely because he did not have access to the\nnecessary forms and he did not have the ability to complete\nthem during the fifteen-day filing period; therefore, no rem-\nedy was available for him to exhaust properly. Marella was\nrequired to “complete the administrative review process in\naccordance with the applicable procedural rules, including\ndeadlines, as a precondition to bringing suit in federal court.”\nWoodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 88 (2006). The California\nprison system’s requirements “define the boundaries of proper\nexhaustion.” See Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 (2007).\nThe California Code of Regulations provides that an inmate\nmust submit an appeal within fifteen working days of the\nevent or decision being appealed, but the appeals coordinator\nis only permitted to reject an appeal if “[t]ime limits for sub-\nmitting the appeal are exceeded and the appellant had the\nopportunity to file within the prescribed time constraints.”\nCal. Code Regs. tit. 15 §§ 3084.6(c) and 3084.3(c)(6) (empha-\nsis added). The California Department of Corrections and\nRehabilitation Operating Manual directs the appeals coordina-\ntor to “ensure that the inmate or parolee had, in fact, the\nopportunity to file in a timely manner.” Section 54100.8.1.\nThus, the prison’s regulations explicitly create an exception to\nthe timely filing requirement. If Marella was unable to file\nwithin the fifteen-day filing period, his failure to file timely\ndoes not defeat his claim. The MJ found that Marella was\nonly in the hospital for two nights, but the MJ did not make\nfactual findings as to whether Marella had access to the neces-\nsary forms and whether he had the ability to file during his\nstay in the hospital and prison infirmary, or during the admin-\nistrative lockdown. On remand, the district court should con-\nsider whether Marella had the opportunity to file within\nfifteen days following the assault.\n\n  [2] The district court also erred in dismissing Marella’s\ncomplaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies\nbeyond the second level of the prison appeals system because\nMarella had been informed that the appeals process was\nunavailable to him. See Brown v. Valoff, 422 F.3d 926, 935\n\f                     MARELLA v. TERHUNE                    4321\n(9th Cir. 2005) (the PLRA “does not require exhaustion when\nno pertinent relief can be obtained through the internal pro-\ncess”). Marella was not required to “exhaust further levels of\nreview once he [had] . . . been reliably informed by an admin-\nistrator that no remedies are available.” See id. After Marella\nfiled his first level appeal, he received a form rejecting the\nappeal because it was not timely filed and there was “no\nexplanation of why [he] did not, or could not, file in a timely\nmanner.” The form also stated that “[t]his screening action\nmay not be appealed unless you allege that the above reason\nis inaccurate.” Marella did not dispute that his appeal was\nuntimely, and he did not dispute that he had not explained\nwhy he was unable to file in a timely manner. Thus, according\nto the form, he was not permitted to appeal the decision.\nTherefore, we reverse the district court’s dismissal of the case\nfor failure to appeal properly because the appeals process was\nunavailable to him.\n\n   [3] Although Marella received a proper Rand notice earlier\n(see Rand, 154 F.3d at 960-61), the question is whether a sec-\nond Rand notice was required following the order requesting\nsupplemental briefing as to whether Woodford requires him to\nprovide evidentiary support to rebut defendants’ claim that he\nhad not exhausted administrative remedies. The question is\nclose, but we conclude fair notice requires more. The order\nfor supplemental briefing “inject[ed] renewed uncertainty and\ncomplexity into the summary judgment procedure,” therefore,\nthe previously issued Rand notice did not effectively give\nMarella fair notice that he should have submitted evidence\nregarding exhaustion of remedies. See Wyatt v. Terhune, 315\nF.3d 1108, 1115 (9th Cir. 2003). On remand, Marella should\nbe allowed to submit evidence regarding exhaustion of reme-\ndies.\n\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n\f1>     PRINTED FOR L>ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE—U.S. COURTS L>BY\n      THOMSON REUTERS/WEST—SAN FRANCISCO D6>\nThe summary, which does not constitute a part f the opinion of the court, is copyrighted\n                          © 2009 omson Reuters/West.\n\f",
