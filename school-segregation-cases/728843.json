We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the afternoon of February 11, 2004, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Detective Michael Castaneda was acting undercover on the Internet as a 14-year-old girl using the screen name \"christine13.\" Castaneda entered a chat channel labeled \"ltgirlsexchat\" and received an instant message from Curtin, who used the screen name \"M-42SOCAL.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The detective, as \"Christy,\" and Curtin \"chatted\" through instant messaging for approximately four hours. They exchanged photos early in the conversation. Castaneda sent Curtin a picture of a female police officer, taken when she was fourteen years old. Curtin said his name was \"Kenny\" and that he was forty-two years old, divorced, and living in Anaheim, California. He told Christy that he was planning to travel to Las Vegas on Friday, February 13 and invited her to go to a \"Penn and Teller\" show on Sunday, February 15. Christy agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin extensively discussed sex with Christy during this conversation, saying that he would love for her to \"spend the night\" after the show and hoped to \"get a room.\" Curtin told Christy \"I want to make you happy. . . . If you were masturbating and fantasizing about sex, I'd love to have sex with you.\" He added that they \"could just make out or I could just give you oral sex or we could just fool around.\" Finally, Curtin made plans to meet Christy in the bowling alley of a Las Vegas casino at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 15. At the end of the conversation, Curtin asked Christy to try sleeping naked that night, and to \"imagine my face moving between your legs and licking you. Imagine my tongue penetrating you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Curtin sent Christy an email message saying \"I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to Sunday. We're going to have a great time.\" The detective and Curtin later that day had another \"chat\" during which Curtin continued to make explicit references to having sex with Christy. Curtin concluded the \"chat\" by confirming their meeting and telling Christy he would introduce her to Penn and Teller as his niece, adding, \"Let's not get caught, ever.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that Sunday, the police officer whose picture was sent to Curtin waited in the bowling alley as a decoy, dressed in the clothes that Christy indicated she would be wearing. Eight to ten other law enforcement officers were also present. Curtin entered the bowling alley at 1:45 p.m. and walked towards the area where the decoy officer was sitting. He walked past her and then turned and walked past her again, looking at her each time. Curtin then left the area where the decoy was sitting and went to the back of the bowling alley, where he used his personal digital assistant. At the request of law enforcement officers, a casino security guard approached Curtin and asked for identification. Curtin showed the guard a United States passport and subsequently left the bowling alley area of the casino.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin reentered the bowling alley approximately 2:05 p.m. He looked around and again walked to the area where the decoy officer was sitting. After less than a minute, he moved even closer to her, looking in her direction the entire time. He stopped behind the officer and she turned and said \"hi\" to him. Whether he said \"hi\" in return is disputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He then left the bowling alley and started getting into a van, at which point law enforcement officers stopped and asked him for identification. He was detained by police and advised of his rights under <i>Miranda.</i> After Curtin waived these rights, he agreed to speak with the law enforcement officers. In a voluntary statement, he stated that he had traveled by car to Las Vegas for meetings. He explained that he was at the bowling alley to meet a female friend he had met on the internet. He admitted to using the screen name and email address used to contact Christy. Curtin explained that he often enters chat rooms and \"role play[s]\" as if he is engaged in \"daddy/daughter\" type conversations, and that he expected Christy to be a thirty- to forty-year-old woman pretending to be a girl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin was then arrested by the Las Vegas police. Upon searching his van and hotel room, police seized his digital assistant and laptop computer. The digital assistant contained over 140 stories about adults having sex with children. The laptop contained a list of chat channels that Curtin had accessed in the past, as well as pictures of girls whose names matched some of those in his \"chat\" list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin was indicted on one count of travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), and one count of coercion and enticement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2422(b). Curtin filed two motions in limine asking the district court to exclude the stories found on his digital assistant from evidence. The district court denied these motions in limine. On the second day of trial, the government offered two of the stories, \"My Little Sister\" and \"Love for the World,\" to show modus operandi, intent, preparation, and knowledge. They were admitted over Curtin's objection. The engineer who extracted the stories from the digital assistant testified that both stories were about a father having sex with his young daughter and the daughter's enjoyment of the experience. However, when the government sought to introduce a third story, \"Melanie's Busy Day,\" the district court stopped the questioning. The court allowed the government to ask general questions without admitting the stories, such as whether they all related to sex between a minor and an adult. However, recognizing the highly prejudicial nature of the stories, the court held that the story could be entered into evidence only if it tied into Curtin's intent, knowledge, preparation, or modus operandi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then asked the court to make a preliminary legal determination about the admissibility of the remaining stories. The government argued that \"Melanie's Busy Day\" was admissible to show general intent, modus operandi, preparation, and knowledge because it had language similar to that used by Curtin in his email to Christy, namely, language concerning oral sex and a child masturbating. The government argued that \"Missing Big Brother,\" which discussed how the adult did not want to hurt the child during sex, was also admissible for intent, modus operandi, preparation, and knowledge. The government made similar arguments with regard to seventeen other stories, with titles such as \"I'm Being Molested,\" \"The Good Girl,\" \"A Relative Interest,\" \"Restrictions,\" \"Teaching the Kids,\" and \"Mommy Juice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following morning, Curtin renewed his objection to the admission of the stories, arguing that they were highly prejudicial and were being admitted to show propensity. The district court held that if the government could cite a part of the story that related to one of the permissible purposes under Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 404(b), then the court would admit the entire story to show general intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted to being unable to read the stories because they were so disturbing. \"I thought about this problem overnight because I want to address the relative overwhelming prejudice versus the purpose. I read the first story and a little bit of the second. <i>That's as far as I could get,</i> which is confirming [defense counsel's] statement. It has a tendency to overwhelm you and overwhelm the jury.\" However, after more argument, the district court agreed to give a limiting instruction and to admit five of the stories: \"My Little Sister\" (which involved incest and the impregnation of a nine year-old girl), \"Love for the World\" (which involved incest), \"Restrictions\" (same), \"Daddy's Lessons\" (same), and \"Melanie's Busy Day\" (which involved an eleven-year-old girl initiating sex with, among others, her father and her teacher).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limiting instruction given was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person cannot be charged nor convicted of literature that they read or that they possess. That's why I'm giving you the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Government has the obligation to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had the wrongful intent. They may offer possession of such literature to show that. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may take this kind of evidence on the question of whether the defendant actually possessed the intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may also take it on the additional questions which go to the question of intent, whether he practiced in this alleged conduct methodology consistent with literature that he had or tending to show that he prepared to commit the acts or that he had knowledge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act was illegal. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, for those four reasons, only, the Government is offering to show that the defendant possessed this literature; intent, method, preparation, and knowledge. And you may only take it for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, you have a constitutional right. You have that right. You would want to protect the defendant's right to possess any kind of literature and to read it or not read it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin contends that the five stories were inadmissible character evidence, introduced to show propensity in violation of Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The government responds that the stories fall outside the parameters of Rule 404(b) because they are inextricably intertwined with the charged crimes. Alternatively, the government argues that the stories were properly admitted under Rule 404(b) to prove Curtin's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the admitted stories were \"inextricably intertwined\" with the facts giving rise to the indictment against Curtin and therefore not \"other acts\" evidence within the scope of Rule 404(b). We review de novo the question of whether the evidence was within the scope of Rule 404(b). <i>See United States v. DeGeorge,</i> 380 F.3d 1203, 1219 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two categories of evidence may be considered \"inextricably intertwined\" with a charged offense and therefore admitted without regard to Rule 404(b). First, evidence of prior acts may be admitted if the evidence \"constitutes a part of the transaction that serves as the basis for the criminal charge.\" <i>DeGeorge,</i> 380 F.3d at 1220, <i>quoting United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez,</i> 66 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.1995). In <i>United States v. Montgomery,</i> 384 F.3d 1050, 1062(9th Cir.2004), we held that a government report detailing individual fraudulent acts was \"inextricably intertwined\" with the underlying conspiracy charge because the acts themselves comprised the conspiracy. Therefore, the report was admissible without regard to Rule 404(b). Similarly, in <i>United States v. Lillard,</i> 354 F.3d 850, 854 (9th Cir.2003), we concluded that the defendant's theft of cocaine from a shipment, which was itself the basis for the conspiracy, was \"inextricably intertwined\" with the conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, prior act evidence may be admitted without regard to Rule 404(b) \"when it [is] necessary to do so in order to permit the prosecutor to offer a coherent and comprehensible story regarding the commission of the crime.\" <i>DeGeorge,</i> 380 F.3d at 1220, <i>quoting Vizcarra-Martinez,</i> 66 F.3d at 1012-13. \"A jury is entitled to know the circumstances and background of a criminal charge. It cannot be expected to make its decision in a void &#8212; without knowledge of the time, place, and circumstances of the acts which form the basis of the charge.\" <i>United States v. Daly,</i> 974 F.2d 1215, 1217(9th Cir.1992), <i>quoting United States v. Moore,</i> 735 F.2d 289, 292 (8th Cir.1984). In <i>United States v. Beckman,</i> 298 F.3d 788, 794 (9th Cir.2002), the defendant was charged with importing over 1,500 pounds of marijuana. His defense was that he was tricked into transporting the marijuana by the chief government cooperating witness. This witness testified at length about prior drug runs that Beckman had made on his behalf. We held that the witness's testimony was \"inextricably intertwined\" with the charged offense, because it was \"intended to establish [the witness's] relationship to Beckman [and] to show that the relationship was ongoing. . . .\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Curtin was in possession of stories detailing sex with children at the time he went to meet \"Christy\" is insufficient to support the introduction of the stories without regard to Rule 404(b). Curtin was charged with traveling across state lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, and with attempting to persuade a minor to engage in sex. The possession or content of the stories was not a part of the \"transaction\" that led to the present charges. Second, the admission of the stories was not required for the prosecution to \"offer a coherent story.\" The prosecution would have had no difficulty in presenting all relevant evidence, including the \"chat\" conversations, Curtin's admission that he was \"M-42SOCAL,\" and Curtin's behavior at the meeting place, without the admission of the stories. Thus, the stories were not \"inextricably intertwined\" with the charged crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the alternative, the government contends that the stories are admissible under Rule 404(b) regardless of whether they are inextricably intertwined with the crime. We review a district court's admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) for an abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Romero,</i> 282 F.3d 683, 688 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We use a four-part test to determine whether evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b). <i>United States v. Spillone,</i> 879 F.2d 514, 518 (9th Cir.1989). First, \"there must be sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the defendant committed the other [act].\" <i>Id.</i> Second, \"the other [act] must not be too remote [in time].\" <i>Id.</i> at 519. Third, when admitted to prove intent, \"the prior act must be similar.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, \"the prior act must be introduced in order to prove a material element of the case.\" <i>Id.</i> The main issue here lies in the third element: whether there is similarity between the possession of the stories and the crime with which Curtin is charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin objected to admission of the stories in the district court, relying on <i>Guam v. Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d 1154(9th Cir. 1998) (as amended). Shymanovitz was a middle-school guidance counselor who was charged with sexually and physically abusing several of the boys under his supervision. <i>Id.</i> at 1155. Prior to trial, the government sought to introduce two magazine articles from sexually explicit magazines found in Shymanovitz's home, arguing that they were relevant to establishing intent. The articles were both presumably fictional stories. One depicted sex between a father and son, while the other depicted sex between a priest and a child. The court deferred ruling on the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court permitted a police officer to testify that at Shymanovitz's house she seized, among other things, condoms, surgical gloves, children's underwear, and sexually explicit magazines. The officer testified in great detail, over defense counsel's objections, about the contents of four of these magazines. She told the jury that the magazines contained explicit photographs of homosexual sex and described the photographs and the contents of the two articles in detail. The two articles were subsequently entered into evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 1155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Shymanovitz</i> and this appeal address whether the reading material at issue was admissible under Rule 404(b). We concluded in <i>Shymanovitz</i> that the magazine articles failed to constitute a Rule 404(b) \"bad act.\" \"[P]ossession of lawful reading material is simply not the type of conduct contemplated by Rule 404(b).\" <i>Id.</i> at 1159. Additionally, we held that possession of lawful reading material was not similar to actual criminal conduct, thus failing the third criterion of the <i>Spillone</i> test. \"[T]here is simply no doubt that a wide gulf separates the act of <i>possessing</i> written descriptions or stories about criminal conduct from the act of <i>committing</i> the offenses described.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the issue of similarity, <i>Shymanovitz</i> conforms with the rest of our case law. In <i>Vizcarra-Martinez,</i> the defendant was charged with conspiracy to possess a chemical with reason to believe it would be used to make methamphetamine. 66 F.3d at 1009. The district court admitted evidence that Vizcarra-Martinez was in possession of a personal-use amount of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest. We reversed. \"We simply cannot assume... that Vizcarra-Martinez's use of methamphetamine tended to prove that he knew that the chemical in his possession would be used in the methamphetamine manufacturing process.\" <i>Vizcarra-Martinez,</i> 66 F.3d at 1015. The cases in which we have allowed Rule 404(b) evidence show a much stronger connection between the \"other act,\" which is often a crime in itself, and the charged crime. In <i>United States v. Vo,</i> 413 F.3d 1010, 1018-19 (9th Cir.2005), where the defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, we allowed the admission of a prior conviction for drug selling. \"Vo's prior conviction was evidence of his knowledge of drug trafficking and distribution in general. The conviction tended to show that Vo was familiar with distribution of illegal drugs and that his actions in this case were not an accident or a mistake.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1019.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Shymanovitz</i> does recognize a narrow exception for \"modus operandi\" evidence: evidence involving acts by the defendant that are \"so nearly identical in method as to ear-mark the charged offense the handiwork of the accused and that are so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1159 n. 9 (internal punctuation and citation omitted). \"[U]se of modus operandi evidence is rare, and the similarities must be specific and detailed and clearly set the particular offense apart from the general body of such offenses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case is not sufficiently detailed and specific to fall within the exception. The stories did not describe specific methods of committing the first offense with which Curtin was charged: traveling across state borders to have sex with a minor. Rather, the stories mostly involved explicit descriptions of incest. Thus, the stories do not reveal a relevant modus operandi to commit the charged crime, and are inadmissible. The issue is closer with regard to the charge of use of an interstate facility to attempt to persuade a minor to engage in sex. The government argued that the language in the stories was similar to the language used by Curtin in his \"chat\" conversations. We conclude that <i>Shymanovitz</i> forecloses our acceptance of the government's position. The conduct with which Curtin was charged, and the language that Curtin used, can \"hardly be construed as either distinctive or remarkable in the universe of sexual offenses against minors.\" <i>Id. Compare United States v. Dhingra,</i> 371 F.3d 557, 566-67 (9th Cir.2004) (as amended) (allowing introduction of Rule 404(b) modus operandi evidence where \"[i]n both instances, Dhingra contacted a minor under the age of 18 years over [instant messenger] for the purpose of soliciting sexual activity, arranged to meet, and at the meeting attempted to engage in sexual activity by persuasion and coercion.\"). The similarities between the stories and Curtin's conduct were not distinctive or unusual enough to render the stories admissible as modus operandi evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies on <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 341 F.3d 870 (9th Cir.2003), to distinguish <i>Shymanovitz.</i> In <i>Allen,</i> the defendants were charged with violating federally protected rights on the basis of race and religion. We allowed the introduction of \"skinhead and white supremacist evidence,\" including color photographs of the defendant's tattoos (e.g., swastikas), Nazi-related literature, group photographs including some of the defendants (e.g., in \"Heil Hitler\" poses and standing before a swastika that they later set on fire), and other skinhead paraphernalia. <i>Id.</i> at 885-86. We distinguished <i>Shymanovitz:</i> \"Key to our reasoning [in <i>Shymanovitz</i>] was the fact that the testimony . . . was not relevant to proving any of the elements of the crime for which the defendant was convicted....\" <i>Id.</i> at 887 n. 25. The government thus contends that, when read together, \"<i>Shymanovitz</i> and <i>Allen</i> stand for the principle that relevant literature is admissible to prove intent.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the government's comparison to <i>Allen</i> does not save the day. First, many of the items admitted into evidence in <i>Allen</i> involved more than the possession of reading material. The defendants were active participants in \"Heil Hitler\" poses and had posed with and burned a large swastika. Second, unlike in <i>Shymanovitz,</i> there is no indication that the reading material in <i>Allen</i> was fictional. Third, the evidence at issue in this case, and in <i>Shymanovitz,</i> was extremely prejudicial. Finally, it is possible that the evidence in <i>Allen</i> would have been admissible under the \"inextricably intertwined\" exception outlined above. Our holding here is controlled by <i>Shymanovitz.</i> The district court committed an abuse of discretion by admitting the stories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government fails to argue harmless error and thus the issue is ordinarily waived. <i>See United States v. Varela-Rivera,</i> 279 F.3d 1174, 1180 (9th Cir. 2002). We may, however, consider harmlessness <i>sua sponte</i> in \"those unusual cases in which the harmlessness of any error is clear beyond serious debate and further proceedings are certain to replicate the original result.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Flores,</i> 418 F.3d 1093, 1100 (9th Cir.2005). \"[T]he court's certainty as to the harmlessness of the error ... is of particular importance.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1101 (citations omitted). \"[E]rror is harmless if we can say with fair assurance that it did not have a substantial effect, injurious to the defendant, on the jury's decision-making process.\" <i>Arnold v. Runnels,</i> 421 F.3d 859, 867 (9th Cir.2005) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we do not have the requisite level of certainty that the error was harmless to consider the issue <i>sua sponte.</i> Most of the sexual activity described in the stories admitted from Curtin's PDA was incestuous, a particularly prejudicial taboo. The admitted stories were so highly disturbing that even the district court judge stated he was unable to read them. The issue of harmless error is waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin contends in his reply brief that the district court abused its discretion pursuant to Rule 403 by admitting the stories because the probative value of the stories is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Curtin. However, Curtin did not specifically and distinctly make a Rule 403 argument in his opening brief. \"[O]n appeal, arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed waived.\" <i>Smith v. Marsh,</i> 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (citation omitted); <i>see also Greenwood v. FAA,</i> 28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994). The argument is waived. In any event, for the same reason we cannot say that the error was harmless, we cannot say that the admission of the materials on Curtin's PDA was not unduly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin argues that the government's failure to request a copy of the surveillance video from the casino violated due process and entitled him to a spoliation instruction. We disagree. The government's duty to preserve evidence arises when the evidence \"possess[es] an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and[is] of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\" <i>California v. Trombetta,</i> 467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984). \"Unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police, failure to preserve potentially useful evidence does not constitute a denial of due process of law.\" <i>Arizona v. Youngblood,</i> 488 U.S. 51, 58, 109 S.Ct. 333, 102 L.Ed.2d 281 (1988). As Curtin failed to show that the video had any exculpatory value, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining Curtin's request for a spoliation instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin also argues that the district court failed to instruct adequately on what constitutes a substantial step. The district court instructed in accord with the model jury instructions that \"mere preparation was not a substantial step.\" <i>See</i> Model Crim. Jury Instr. 9th Cir. &#167; 5.3 (2003). This fairly and adequately covered the issue. <i>See United States v. Echeverry,</i> 759 F.2d 1451, 1455 (9th Cir.1985) (\"So long as the instructions fairly and adequately cover the issues presented, the judge's formulation of those instructions or choice of language is a matter of discretion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The dissent argues that this case differs from<i>Shymanovitz</i> because the crimes at issue in that case did not involve subjective intent. But even if <i>Shymanovitz</i> involves slightly different facts, its legal rule does not distinguish between specific intent crimes and other crimes. \"Under the government's theory, the case against an accused child molester would be stronger if he owned a copy of Nabokov's <i>Lolita,</i> and any murder defendant would be unfortunate to have in his possession a collection of Agatha Christie mysteries. . . . \" <i>Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d at 1159. Put simply, <i>Shymanovitz</i> is replete with language that dictates the outcome of this appeal. We may not ignore its controlling effect on this case. <i>See Barapind v. Enomoto,</i> 400 F.3d 744, 751 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent's discussion of cases like <i>United States v. McCollum,</i> 732 F.2d 1419, 1425 (9th Cir.1984), which involve the admission of similar prior criminal convictions to prove intent, is equally off point. In <i>McCollum,</i> we allowed admission of a prior conviction for armed robbery to negate the defendant's defense of acting under hypnosis. The relationship between the prior crime and the act charged is obviously far closer in McCollum's case than it is in Curtin's. Curtin's case involves otherwise lawful reading material that is not similar to the crime with which he is being charged. Essentially, the government here seeks to introduce possession of material that describes one type of criminal conduct, namely incest with minors, to prove intent to commit another type of criminal conduct, namely crossing state borders to have sex with a minor. This is impermissible under our caselaw.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also argues at length that Curtin's case is different because Curtin was actually in possession of the stories at the time of his arrest. However, the government never argued relevance based on physical possession. In any event, this is a fallacious distinction because the stories were saved as documents to Curtin's handheld computer. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we should not infer that Curtin planned to \"use\" the stories or had the stories in mind simply because he was carrying his computer at the time of his arrest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the dissent's assertion, we have not \"made relevant literature off limits in the Ninth Circuit as a matter of law.\" Nor do we \"hamstring[ ] the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Circuit with adults who see children as sexual prey.\" As pointed out above, in this case the prosecution may rely on Curtin's presence in a chat room called \"ltgirlsexchat,\" the \"chat\" conversations themselves, Curtin's admission that he was \"M-42SOCAL,\" and Curtin's behavior at the meeting place</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In terms of otherwise lawfully-possessed literature, modus operandi evidence and inextricably intertwined evidence remain admissible. Here, however, the jury was asked \"to infer from behavior on one occasion something about the nature of a person and then to infer from that how the person probably would have behaved on another occasion when the only connection between the two occasions is that the[jury] believes that people of a certain type would act the same way both times.\" 1 Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual &#167; 404.02[9](8th ed.2002). Without more of a connection between the literature and the accused crimes, the literature is no more than character evidence introduced to show propensity, , and highly prejudicial character evidence at that.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent argues at length that the evidence was necessary to refute Curtin's testimony and \"aggressive defense\" of his intent to meet an adult, and attempts to distinguish <i>Shymanovitz</i> because Curtin actually testified. However, the stories were not offered for impeachment, on which we express no opinion. Nor do we believe that the stories were necessary given the strength of other evidence introduced by the government. In any event, evidence is not admissible solely because it may be necessary or helpful. Wholly apart from its prejudicial effect, we have held that \"[t]he mere possession of reading material that describes a particular type of activity makes it neither more nor less likely that a defendant would intentionally engage in the conduct described and thus fails to meet the test of relevancy under Rule 401.\" <i>Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d at 1158. Here, the materials in Curtin's possession told stories of incestuous sexual acts that were different from those he was accused of intending to perpetrate. They were offered as substantive evidence of guilt, and we simply hold that their admission in this case was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">TROTT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 20th Century, the four walls of a family's home provided substantial protection from marauding sexual predators on the prowl for children and unsuspecting minors to assault. Locked doors and windows could normally safeguard a dwelling from invasion, as well as shelter parents' vulnerable children from harm. Distant parks, playgrounds, malls, and sidewalks surrounding school yards were the child molester's preferred hunting grounds. No longer. Now, the Internet is upon us, and it allows cunning sexual vultures repeatedly to enter the bedrooms of immature children where, by seductive and calculating means, unwary children are enticed to leave the security of their homes and to venture into unspeakable dangers. Moreover, the invaders themselves do so invisibly, appearing only on a video screen, unseen by the unsuspecting adults on site. This case provides an example of this frightful situation which generations not yet familiar with the dark side of the Internet have been slow to recognize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the walls of our homes breached by the Internet, our next best defense is the law. Unfortunately, this case reveals that the laws and the rules of evidence upon which society relies to protect itself from cruel deviancy are now as porous as the walls of our homes, allowing lawbreakers to pull the wool over the eyes of the jurors delegated to ensure that our laws are faithfully implemented. It seems that the law of relevancy is now more concerned with protecting a sexual predator's obscene manuals on what to do to children than with protecting the real children upon whom they practice their perversions, as this case illustrates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin's explanation to the jury for his Internet behavior with \"christy13\" and trip to Las Vegas was that he intended to act out an incestuous sexual fantasy with her, but that he expected her to be an adult who would pretend to be his innocent unspoiled daughter. Although he called his sexual fantasy \"daddy daughter,\" he denied that the \"daughter\" would be a minor. If worthy of belief, this intent would defeat the prosecution's case, which required proof of an intent to engage a minor in unlawful sexual activity. However, Curtin had on his person at the time of his anticipated encounter with \"christy13\" obscene literature tending without ambiguity to prove that the object of his incest fantasy was a child, not an adult. My respected colleagues conclude that the district court erred in admitting this inculpatory literature because &#8212; <i>as a matter of law</i> &#8212; it was not relevant. I disagree. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The evidence developed against Kevin Curtin by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department suggests on its face that he is a dangerous predatory pedophile who uses the Internet electronically to enter the homes of his immature juvenile female victims in order to lure them into danger. Curtin's M.O., or modus operandi, involving calculated \"grooming\" and enticement is well known to the police who work this detail. Here, Curtin contacted his prey through a chat room called \"ltgirlsexchat,\" which, according to the evidence, is a place on the Internet where people go to talk sex with little girls. The evidence reveals also that he planned a family cover story for his time with his victim. He, as Uncle Kevin, would introduce her as his \"niece.\" In addition, he asked her if she was working with the police in order \"to get guys who make out with 14-year-old girls.\" These aspects of the government's evidence would seem to portray the subjective intent required by the charges filed against him and a keen awareness of the unlawful nature of what he was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But wait, he protests, what you see and what you read on my exchanges with \"christy13\" is not what you get. I'm not an online predator trolling for naive juveniles, my true intent &#8212; hard to discern though it may be &#8212; is to sexually hook-up with mature females who are hanging out in juvenile chat rooms posing as minors. I'm merely a \"lonely divorcee [sic] looking for an older woman who may have a place to go,\" because I do not have a place of my own. It's just a game of role playing. \"[N]ormally in this sort of thing it would be a fantasy. Sort of like daddy/daughter or along those lines.\" My real intent was to hook up with a thirty to forty year-old role playing woman pretending to be 14-year-old who was interested in actualizing such an incestuous sexual fantasy, certainly not a minor. But of course, this is \"my first time.\" \"I haven't ever kissed anyone but my wife since &#8212; in fifteen years.\" And, by the way, \"no one ever sends a picture of what they actually look like.\" Moreover, everything I wrote to \"christy13\" that makes it appear that I understood her to be a minor?

Both charges required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtin acted with the intent to engage a person under the age of eighteen years in unlawful sexual behavior.

Curtin went so far as to file a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the \"undisputed and uncontested facts\" made it patently obvious that the government had \"no credible evidence to suggest that [Curtin's] subjective intentions were to travel to Las Vegas to have sex with a minor\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin did not possess an intent to have sex with a 14 year old girl when he got into his car and drove to Las Vegas; the overwhelming evidence points the other way. His voluntary statement, given minutes after he was stopped by the police, shows this. He thought it was all too easy, that no 14 year old was going to just hop into bed with a 42 year old after two chat sessions, especially a pretty girl. As he said in his statement, her Mary Poppins naivety was <i>beyond any level of credence.</i> It was so easy and uncredible that he even wondered if it could have been police. In any event, he was not concerned, because when he left California to go to Las Vegas, he was going to find work, and at the time he left California to travel to Nevada, he had no intentions of having relations with a minor, as irrebuttably shown by the fact that he did not so much as talk to the person. This meeting was the litmus test of his true intentions in this nebulous and hazy situation. He clearly and without question passed this test. When he calmly and simply walked away, the police wanted to know why. He told them. He clearly and unequivocally explained that he did not talk to this person because he stopped by the Suncoast with the hope and intentions of meeting an older woman. HAD HE BEEN THERE TO MEET A MINOR, AS IS THE CRUX OF THIS INDICTMENT, THEN HE WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AT THAT POINT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

In the instant case, the defendant did not think he was dealing with a minor. The police knew there [was] not a minor and in fact there was not a minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the line was drawn by Curtin. His defense was a matter of record. The trial would be about intent and what was in Curtin's mind during his undisputed conduct with \"christy13.\" This was the issue, the only issue: subjective intentions. As counsel for Curtin said in his opening statement, \"[Curtin] thought it was someone his age that he was dealing with and that they would role play in a situation much like a dad and a daughter.\" Counsel concluded on this what-was-in-Curtin's-mind theme by telling the jury that \"this is the type of crime that is a situation where you have to look at the thoughts.\" To prevail, of course, Curtin would not be called upon to satisfy the jury that his defense was true. All he had to do is raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a single juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confronted with Curtin's aggressive fantasy intent defense &#8212; to sexually play daddy/daughter incest, not with a minor but with an adult &#8212; and facing the traditional daunting burden of proof, the government offered stories contained on Curtin's PDA, or \"personal digital assistant.\" These stories were offered pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) for two equally appropriate purposes: (1) to prove that Curtin harbored the subjective intent made unlawful by law, and (2) to rebut Curtin's defense that the daughter in his daddy/daughter sexual fantasy was an adult pretending to be a child. From the beginning, the government was put on notice by the court that in order for the stories to be properly admitted, each story would have to comport to the admissibility conditions of Fed. R.Evid. 401 and 404(b) as well as the probative versus prejudice limitations found in Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What was the content of the material on Curtin's PDA? It consisted of approximately 140 stories containing graphic descriptions of sexual acts with minors. Not a single story on Curtin's PDA was about daddy/daughter role playing with adults. The stories admitted in evidence are built around daddies having sexual relations with <i>child</i> daughters, not adults, and the content of the stories parallel Curtin's email exchanges with his target.

Any lingering question of relevancy was put to rest by Curtin's defense that it was all a fantasy directed at an adult.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The similarities between the solicitous \"grooming\" email conversations and the content of the stories is readily apparent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p212\">\n      <span class=\"num\">212</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court did not admit all 140 stories, only five, taking great care in the exercise of its discretion to restrict their use to the main issue and to eliminate possible undue prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p213\">\n      <span class=\"num\">213</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With all respect to my colleagues, <i>Guam v. Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir. 1998), does not dictate the outcome of this case, and its holding does not as a matter of law render abusive the district court's exercise of discretion. In the parlance of the profession, <i>Shymanovitz</i> is distinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, unlike the specific intent crimes with which Curtin was charged, the combination of crimes in <i>Shymanovitz</i> &#8212; generally unlawful sexual activity with minors &#8212; required an entirely different type of mens rea from the specific intent required here. One of the crimes charged in <i>Shymanovitz,</i> \"sexual penetration,\" did \"not include any requirement that the defendant act with intent,\" <i>id.</i> at 1157, just that the defendant have engaged in sexual penetration with the victim. The other crime, sexual contact with a minor, required touching that was intentional rather than accidental. Moreover, the actual purpose of the person doing the touching was immaterial. As Judge Reinhardt explained,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he charges based on sexual contact require the government to prove that any touching on Shymanovitz' part was intentional, and that a reasonable person could construe the touching to be for a sexual purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Shymanovitz's <i>actual</i> purpose in touching the alleged victims was sexual arousal or gratification, however, or whether he was <i>actually</i> aroused or gratified by the touching is <i>immaterial</i> to the offenses, including the charges based on improper sexual contact. Instead, the question in the latter category of cases is whether a reasonable person could construe the touching to be for such a purpose. <i>The test, under the sexual contact statute, is an objective not a subjective one.</i> In short, it is the <i>character</i> of the touching that is at issue, <i>not the purpose of the intentional toucher.</i> Accordingly, the government's current and sole justification for admitting the challenged evidence goes, <i>once again, to the proof of an element immaterial to the offense.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1158 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defense in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was not that the alleged touching and penetration were not accompanied by any requisite state of mind, but that the acts charged as crimes never happened. \"His counsel argued that the boys and some of the parents had concocted the allegations against him....\" <i>Id.</i> at 1154. Moreover, Shymanovitz</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... never testified at trial that he believed sexual conduct with minors to be legal. Nor was there testimony to indicate that he somehow lacked knowledge of or familiarity with fellatio, anal intercourse, or other general aspects of homosexual sex. Moreover, neither knowledge of the illegality of the conduct of which he was accused nor knowledge of the nature of the specific acts identified by the prosecutor constituted an element of the offense. More important, such knowledge would in no way tend to prove his guilt on any of the charges brought against him. Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that the government introduced the magazines to address the issues it argued they were relevant to during the prosecutor's closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1156.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, Curtin did testify at the trial, tendering an energetic defense that his intent was to couple with an adult female, not a juvenile. Shymanovitz's defense had nothing to do with intent or state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the stories were in Curtin's possession when he entered the casino in order to meet his target. Not so in <i>Shymanovitz.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, given that the evidence under scrutiny in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was (1) not probative of <i>any</i> issue in the case, and (2) not relevant to Shymanovitz's factual defense, it was appropriate for the panel to conclude as a matter of law that it was not properly received pursuant to Rule 401 or 404(b). The evidence simply failed Rule 401's definition of relevancy and, therefore, also failed Rule 404(b). The evidence did not illuminate \"a fact of consequence to the determination of the action,\" and was nothing more than an attempt to slime the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 1154(referring to the prosecutor's \"untempered and provocative references\" to the evidence).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognized the limited reach of <i>Shymanovitz</i> in <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 341 F.3d 870 (9th Cir.2003). The defendants in <i>Allen</i> were charged with intimidating or interfering with a person's housing rights on account of race or color, in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631. In order to satisfy the statute's requirement of a showing of racial animus, the government offered, and we admitted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... skinhead and white supremacist evidence, including color photographs of their tattoos (e.g., swastikas and other symbols of white supremacy), Nazi-related literature, group photographs including some of the defendants (e.g., in \"Heil Hitler\" poses and standing before a large swastika that they later set on fire), and skinhead paraphernalia (e.g. combat boots, arm-bands with swastikas, and a registration form for the Aryan Nations World Congress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 885-886. The district court ruled (1) that this potentially inflammatory evidence was relevant to proving the defendants' motive, intent and plan, and (2) that its prejudicial potential did not substantially outweigh its probative value as demanded by Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the <i>Allen</i> defendants challenged the trial court's ruling on the ground that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial. We disagreed, relying in large measure on our decision in <i>United States v. Skillman,</i> 922 F.2d 1370 (9th Cir.1991), a race-motivated cross burning case wherein \"skinhead\" literature and materials found in Skillman's garage and on his person at the time of his arrest was used to prove Skillman's state of mind at the time of the crime, even though the government could not establish that Skillman was a skinhead. In <i>Skillman</i> we said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skillman principally relies on <i>United States v. Gillespie,</i> 852 F.2d 475, 479 (9th Cir.1988), where we found it was an abuse of discretion to admit evidence of homosexual conduct of the appellant with his adoptive father in a case where the appellant was charged with transporting his three-year-old god-daughter for illegal sexual purposes. <i>Gillespie is inapposite since the alleged homosexual conduct did not tend to establish a violation of the statutes in issue.</i> Here, the skinhead evidence tended to establish Skillman's racial animus and that he might act on his beliefs. Skillman also contends that the skinhead references were cumulative to other animus evidence, including Exhibit 3, the business card with the racist poem found in his wallet as well as Milum's and Becky's testimony on Skillman's prior race statements. We conclude this evidence was not \"needless[ly]\" cumulative in light of the difficulty in establishing the requisite racial animus <i>and Skillman's theory-of-defense that he was a mere passive bystander at the crime.</i> The district court's evaluation under Rule 403 and the admission of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">922 F.2d at 1374 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, because we perceived in <i>Allen</i> the difference between cases involving specific intent and those that do not, we had no difficulty explaining why <i>Shymanovitz,</i> like <i>Gillespie,</i> was inapposite:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants cite to our decision in <i>Guam v. Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d 1154 (9th Cir.1998), to support their argument that the admission of the skinhead and white supremacy evidence was unduly prejudicial. In <i>Shymanovitz,</i> we concluded that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to introduce testimony about the contents of magazines found at the defendant's apartment, including photographs of men masturbating, ejaculating, using sex toys, and engaging in oral and anal sex (among other things), to prove the defendant's intent in committing sexual acts with minors. 157 F.3d at 1155. <i>Key to our reasoning was the fact that the testimony was highly prejudicial</i> <i>and was not relevant to proving any of the elements of the crime for which the defendant was convicted (unlawful sexual activity with minors). Id.</i> at 1157-60. <i>In contrast, the skinhead and white supremacy evidence here was relevant to proving the element of intent</i> in both &#167;&#167; 241 and 245(b)(2)(B). <i>Moreover, in light of the government's heavy burden of proving racial animus, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the evidence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Allen,</i> 341 F.3d at 887, n. 25 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p233\">\n      <span class=\"num\">233</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues attempt &#8212; unconvincingly I believe &#8212; to distinguish <i>Allen</i> on the basis of insignificant differences between the evidence in <i>Allen</i> and the evidence here. They point out (1) that \"the evidence in <i>Allen</i> involved more than the possession of reading material,\" including photographs showing some of the defendants as active participants in \"Heil Hitler\" poses, (2) that the Nazi literature in <i>Allen</i> may not have been \"fictional,\" and (3) that \"the evidence in this case, and in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was extremely prejudicial,\" apparently as opposed to the evidence in <i>Allen.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p234\">\n      <span class=\"num\">234</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These minor differences are utterly insufficient to render <i>Allen</i> inapposite. First, that <i>Allen</i> involved evidence in addition to reading material is inconsequential, as each \"offer of evidence is to be evaluated independently under the Federal Rules of Evidence and the relevant case law.\" <i>United States v. Bertoli,</i> 854 F.Supp. 975, 1079 (D.N.J.1994) <i>vacated in part on unrelated grounds,</i> 40 F.3d 1384 (3d Cir.1994). Second, I fail to see any material difference between real stories of sexual perversion and fictional stories of the same ilk. Both serve to excite sexual criminals and to fuel their perverted intentions. Moreover, whether a story's plot is fictional is not material to the question of whether the content of that story relates to and is similar to the conduct of the alleged criminal &#8212; thereby satisfying the requirements of Rules 401 and 404(b). Third, the majority's assertion that \"the evidence at issue in this case and in <i>Shymanovitz</i> [as opposed to <i>Allen</i>] was extremely prejudicial,\" and thus distinguishable, fails to appreciate how the rules of evidence operate. Prejudice is a separate basis for exclusion that requires an independent analysis under Fed.R.Evid. 403 after it is determined that an offer of evidence is relevant and admissible. <i>See Weisgram v. Marley,</i> 528 U.S. 440, 453 n. 9, 120 S.Ct. 1011, 145 L.Ed.2d 958 (2000). As admitted by my colleges, the prejudice argument was waived by Curtin and is not an issue before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p235\">\n      <span class=\"num\">235</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the majority's reasons for distinguishing <i>Allen</i> are inadequate, especially when viewed in the light of the \"literary\" evidence approved in <i>Skillman</i> on which <i>Allen</i> relied. The evidence in <i>Skillman</i> included a \"poem containing racial epithets\" on the back of a business card in Skillman's pocket. We did not segregate out of our holding in <i>Allen,</i> the Nazi literature in his possession. Although literature per se has no special protection in this context as evidence &#8212; under the First Amendment or otherwise &#8212; my colleagues have effectively made relevant literature categorically off-limits as a source of evidence as to a person's subjective intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way to test the relevancy of Curtin's recent PDA downloads (and to illustrate the difference between the setting here and the circumstances in <i>Shymanovitz</i>) is to envision what we would certainly hold if Curtin's PDA stories<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> were of role playing daddy/daughter incest with female adults &#8212; not minors &#8212; and the district court had excluded the stories as \"irrelevant.\" Curtin would have attempted to admit the stories into evidence to demonstrate that he intended to meet an adult. Without a doubt, a convicted Curtin would assert on appeal that the content of the stories shed light on his subjective intent and &#8212; as counsel put it to the jurors &#8212; his \"thoughts\" as he communicated with \"christy13,\" and as he traveled interstate with the stories in his pocket to meet her; and there is no doubt that we would agree. Why? Because the stories would have a \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 401. Such stories would corroborate his claim of adult incest fantasy. How else could he do that without evidence of \"other acts,\" as they are called? Conversely, the absence of such adult stories coupled with the presence of stories wherein children are the objects of the sexual appetites of adults is equally relevant to prove the government's case and to confront Curtin's defense. Relevancy boils down to what our human experiences tell us, sometimes called common sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p237\">\n      <span class=\"num\">237</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As explained in \"McCormick on Evidence,\" Third Edition, Hornbook Series, Lawyers Edition,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p238\">\n      <span class=\"num\">238</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[H]ow can a judge know whether the evidence could reasonably affect an assessment of the probability of the fact to be inferred? In some instances, scientific research may show that the fact in issue is more likely to be true (or false) when such evidence is present than when it is not. <i>Ordinarily, however, the answer must lie in the judge's own experience, [the judge's] general knowledge, and [the judge's] understanding of human conduct and motivation.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.,</i> &#167; 184 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Internet \"sting\" cases such as this involving claims of entrapment, the issue of what a defendant's state of mind was immediately prior to his contact with a sexual target purporting to be a minor is routinely a serious point of contention. We call the issue one of \"predisposition,\" and it is primarily a question of fact. In <i>United States v. Poehlman,</i> 217 F.3d 692 (9th Cir.2000), for example, Poehlman, a cross-dresser, was charged with willingly crossing state lines to have sex with minors, but it appeared that when first contacted by the government, he was looking for adults with whom to engage in his \"proclivities,\" not children. However, the undercover officer with whom he was corresponding deftly turned Poehlman's prurient interest to children, and he responded accordingly. In court, charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2423(b), Poehlman relied on his initial interest in adults to demonstrate a lack of predisposition to involve minors in his sexual plans, arguing that the government took advantage of that lawful interest and unlawfully used it to steer him to children. In concluding that he had indeed been entrapped, we said, \"The government thus played on Poehlman's obvious need for an adult relationship, for acceptance of his sexual proclivities and for a family, to draw him even deeper into a sexual fantasy world involving these imaginary girls.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To what evidence did we look to verify a factually fatal lack of predisposition on Poehlman's part to target minors? The same kind of material we now place \"off limits\" as a matter of law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By analogy, the fact that Poehlman willingly crossed state lines to have sex with minors after his prolonged and steamy correspondence with Sharon cannot, alone, support a finding of predisposition. It is possible, after all, that it was the government's inducement that brought Poehlman to the point where he became willing to break the law. <i>As in Jacobson, we must consider what evidence there is as to Poehlman's state of mind prior to his contact with Sharon.</i> On this score, the record is sparse indeed; it is easier to say <i>what the record does not confirm than what it does.</i> The government produced no e-mails or chat room postings where Poehlman expressed an interest in sex with children, or even the view that sex with children should be legalized. <i>Nor did the government produce any notes, tapes, magazines, photographs, letters or similar items which disclosed an interest in sex with children, despite a thorough search of Poehlman's home. There was no testimony from the playmates of Poehlman's children, his ex-wife or anyone else indicating that Poehlman had behaved inappropriately toward children or otherwise manifested a sexual interest in them.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

The now-confused dissonance in the law of our circuit on this issue is regrettable, to say the least.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p245\">\n      <span class=\"num\">245</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances here are analogous to those confronted by the Tenth Circuit in two cases, <i>United States v. Viefhaus,</i> 168 F.3d 392 (10th Cir.1999) (per curiam); and <i>United States v. Magleby,</i> 241 F.3d 1306 (10th Cir.2001). Viefhaus had been charged with the use of a telephone to transmit a bomb threat. To illustrate (as required by the Supreme Court in <i>Watts v. United States,</i> 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969)) that the threat made by Viefhaus was a \"true threat\" and not just \"political hyperbole,\" the court admitted \"literature espousing hate and violence\" and \"Nazi propaganda\" found in his home. <i>Id.</i> at 394-395. In turning away Viefhaus's challenge to this evidence, the court said, citing <i>United States v. Cox,</i> 957 F.2d 264 (6th Cir.1992),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p246\">\n      <span class=\"num\">246</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the defendant offers lack of intent as a defense, even though the government does not have to prove subjective intent as an element of the offense, the circumstances surrounding the making of the calls becomes relevant. The evidence offered clearly was probative of defendant's state of mind and tends to counter his allegation of benign purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p247\">\n      <span class=\"num\">247</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p248\">\n      <span class=\"num\">248</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only way a jury could properly assess the sincerity of Viefhaus' beliefs, as well as the likely effect Viefhaus' message would have on an objective listener, was to examine the circumstances in which the comments were made. Although admission of this evidence was harmful to Viefhaus, its probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p249\">\n      <span class=\"num\">249</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Viefhaus,</i> 168 F.3d at 397(sustaining conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c)) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p250\">\n      <span class=\"num\">250</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Magleby</i> the defendant was charged with burning a cross on the property of an interracial family. Recognizing that \"[d]irect evidence of the defendant's intent is seldom available,\" and that \"[i]ntent can be proven from surrounding circumstances,\" 241 F.3d at 1312, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the admission in evidence of vile racist song lyrics frequently sung on occasion by the defendant, which referred repeatedly to African-Americans as \"niggers.\" The court said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p251\">\n      <span class=\"num\">251</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to Mr. Magleby's argument that the lyrics are irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. Although the admission of the lyrics to the Screwdriver song was certainly harmful to Mr. Magleby's case, we conclude that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. This evidence is probative both of Mr. Magleby's racial animus under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631(a) and of his intent under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Viefhaus,</i> 168 F.3d 392 (10th Cir.1999), we held that the context in which an alleged threat is made is probative of whether a \"true threat\" exists. <i>Id.</i> at 398. In <i>Viefhaus,</i> the defendant was convicted of making threats against, interalia, African-Americans, Jews, and federal law enforcement on an answering machine \"hotline.\" <i>The defendant asserted as a defense that he lacked the intent requisite to make a true threat.</i> We upheld the admission of racially inflammatory items as relevant to the defendant's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As did the defendant in <i>Viefhaus,</i> Mr. Magleby denies having the requisite intent under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631(a) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241. The lyrics to the Screwdriver song, as well as the evidence that Mr. Magleby knew the lyrics and could sing along with them, are probative of his intent under these sections. First, &#167; 3631(a) requires that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Magleby targeted the Henrys because of their race. <i>The lyrics and Mr. Magleby's familiarity with them are probative of his racial animus in burning the cross.</i> Second, under &#167; 241, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Magleby had the specific intent to \"oppress, threaten or intimidate\" the Henrys in the enjoyment of their federally protected right to occupy property. <i>Context is important in determining whether a true threat has been made.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessity of demonstrating the context in which the cross was burned renders the Screwdriver lyrics and other evidence of hostility toward the presence of African-Americans in this country intrinsic to a violation of &#167; 241. And, as in <i>Viefhaus,</i> the only way the jury could properly determine the message conveyed by Mr. Magleby's cross-burning and the foreseeable effect it would have on the Henrys was to examine the circumstances in which the cross-burning was conceived, planned, and executed. We fine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the song lyrics into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1319 (emphasis added). I note that part of the evidence used to show Magleby's subjective intent was the circumstance that he had watched a movie, \"Mississippi Burning,\" prior to the cross-burning. <i>Id.</i> at 1313.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p258\">\n      <span class=\"num\">258</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, in similar contexts we have routinely held that circumstances surrounding an alleged crime become <i>more</i> relevant when the defendant makes his intent a disputed issue. Take the case of Larry McCollum. McCollum claimed that although he entered a bank and gave an employee a note demanding $100,000 he had \"no criminal intent\" to commit robbery because he was acting involuntarily under the influence of hypnosis. The district court admitted a prior conviction for armed robbery to counter his defense of a lack of intent. We affirmed, holding as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, ... the defense conceded that McCollum performed all acts charged by the prosecution. The key issue, indeed the only disputed issue, was whether McCollum acted with intent to rob the bank. Where the mental state to be inferred from undisputed overt acts of a defendant is the crucial issue, evidence of past criminal acts has generally been found insufficiently prejudicial to warrant exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p260\">\n      <span class=\"num\">260</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. McCollum,</i> 732 F.2d 1419, 1425(9th Cir.1984) (emphasis added); <i>United States v. Verduzco,</i> 373 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <i>McCollum</i> and affirming the use of evidence of other similar criminal acts to counter an affirmative defense of duress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p261\">\n      <span class=\"num\">261</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the utmost respect to my colleagues, they seem moved to brush <i>McCollum</i> aside by their assumption that the incest materials on Curtin's PDA were \"otherwise lawful reading material.\" This premise is doubtful at best. Obscenity, which is described as a work which appeals to the prurient interest and which describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which when judged by contemporary community standards lacks serious literacy, artistic, political, or scientific value, is not protected by the First Amendment. <i>Miller v. California,</i> 413 U.S. 15, 24-25, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). I will leave it to the reader to decide whether \"Love for the World\" and \"Restrictions\" are otherwise lawful reading material. However, even if they were to be seen as lawful, this fact in no way renders them outside the scope of Rule 404(b). Rule 404(b) <i>on its face</i> covers \"other crimes, wrongs, <i>or acts.</i>\" All relevant extrinsic <i>acts</i> are presumptively admissible, subject to Rule 403. The act of possession of reading material falls within this Rule, whether lawful or not &#8212; so long as the act of possession is relevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p262\">\n      <span class=\"num\">262</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bottom line? <i>McCollum</i> is apposite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p263\">\n      <span class=\"num\">263</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precedents discussing the use of other evidence to establish criminal intent where intent is denied are literally endless. In <i>United States v. Brunson,</i> 657 F.2d 110, 115 (7th Cir.1981), our sister circuit said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p264\">\n      <span class=\"num\">264</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remainder of appellant's contentions are equally unpersuasive. Appellant complains that the trial judge erred in admitting the Government's evidence of appellant's prior allegedly criminal conduct relating to counterfeiting after appellant had admitted that conduct on the stand. The evidence, as stated previously, was offered and admitted in rebuttal to appellant's main defense that he did not intend to use the counterfeit money to defraud anyone. The admission for such purposes was clearly proper both because intent was a necessary element of the crime and because of appellant's chosen defense. Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <i>United States v. Weidman,</i> 572 F.2d 1199, 1202 (7th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 821, 99 S.Ct. 87, 58 L.Ed.2d 113; <i>United States v. Semak,</i> 536 F.2d 1142, 1145 (6th Cir.1976); <i>United States v.

But, once he has succeeded in doing this, it is then for the Crown to destroy that defence in such a manner as to leave in the jury's minds no reasonable doubt that the accused cannot be absolved on the grounds of the alleged compulsion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p268\">\n      <span class=\"num\">268</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(quoted in <i>United States v.

Long before the trial, the defense brought it to the court's attention in a \"motion in limine to exclude,\" a motion that was not successful. [C.R. 22] The government responded in writing on July 8, 2003:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p280\">\n      <span class=\"num\">280</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant relies on <i>Guam v.

However, <i>Shymanovitz</i> can be distinguished from the present case based on the Ninth Circuit's statutory interpretation and the differences between the relevant statute in <i>Shymanovitz</i> and the statutes the Defendant is accused of violating. [C.R. 34].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p281\">\n      <span class=\"num\">281</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To demonstrate the asserted distinction, the government relied on <i>Allen:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p282\">\n      <span class=\"num\">282</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Ninth Circuit has expanded further that \"[key]\" to our reasoning [in <i>Shymanovitz</i>] was the fact that the testimony was not relevant to proving any of the elements of the crime for which the defendant was convicted.\" <i>United States v.

By the above reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, this court clearly may admit literature in the possession of the defendant for the purpose of proving an element of the crime. It can only be presumed that the more fundamental the element is to the crime charged, the more the balance weighs in favor of admission because [Fed.R.Evid.] 404(b) is a \"rule of inclusion.\" <i>United States v.

That's why I'm giving you the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p558\">\n      <span class=\"num\">558</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Government has the obligation to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had the wrongful intent. They may offer possession of such literature to show that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p559\">\n      <span class=\"num\">559</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, most all crimes, state or federal, have, at a minimum, at least two elements. I'll instruct you at the end of the case on what the elements of these crimes are. And the Government must prove every one of them, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p560\">\n      <span class=\"num\">560</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But most all crimes have a minimum of two elements: One, some conduct that's specified in the statute; and number two, a wrongful state of mind or intent. The simplest example I can think of is murder. There is an act, homicide. And there's a wrongful intent, the wrongful taking of another person's life. If you don't have that intent, you haven't committed the crime. If you're involved in an accident in your car and, unfortunately, someone loses their life in that accident, you are not guilty of murder. There is a homicide, to be sure, but there is no wrongful intent. And, therefore, you're not charged, nor convicted, nor alleged with committing a criminal act. You may be sued in court civilly, of course. Therefore, there are two elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p561\">\n      <span class=\"num\">561</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may take this kind of evidence on the question of whether the defendant actually possessed the intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p562\">\n      <span class=\"num\">562</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may also take it on the additional questions which go to the question of intent, whether he practiced in this alleged conduct methodology consistent with literature that he had or tending to show that he prepared to commit the acts or that he had knowledge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act was illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p563\">\n      <span class=\"num\">563</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, the prosecution does not have to show that a defendant knew an act was illegal, simply that he committed the act and that he knew it was wrongful or that he had the wrongful intent. They don't have to prove that he knew it was illegal. But evidence tending to show that he knew it was illegal may or may not tend to show that he had the intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p564\">\n      <span class=\"num\">564</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, for those four reasons, only, the Government is offering to show that the defendant possessed this literature; intent, method, preparation, and knowledge. And you may only take it for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p565\">\n      <span class=\"num\">565</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, you have a constitutional right. You have that right. You would want to protect the defendant's right to possess any kind of literature and to read it or not read it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p566\">\n      <span class=\"num\">566</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that. I'll repeat, finally, in conclusion, the official instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p567\">\n      <span class=\"num\">567</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are about to hear testimony that the defendant possessed various types of articles on his PDA regarding other acts not charged here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p568\">\n      <span class=\"num\">568</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted only for the limited purpose of being considered by you on the question of the defendant's intent, method, preparation, or knowledge and for no other purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p569\">\n      <span class=\"num\">569</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I hope you understand the instruction. With that, I'll permit the prosecution to proceed again today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p570\">\n      <span class=\"num\">570</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues' opinion stands for the questionable proposition that a trial court simply has no discretion in a case involving pedophilia to admit obscene sexual literature, even though the literature &#8212; as it does here &#8212; (1) sheds probative light on a defendant's relevant subjective intent, and (2) rebuts a defendant's primary defense of no criminal mens rea. My colleagues have made relevant literature off limits in the Ninth Circuit as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p571\">\n      <span class=\"num\">571</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ironically, Rule 404(b), a rule of inclusion, references at least three categories of other \"acts\" encompassing the inner workings of the mind: motive, intent, and knowledge. Once it has been established that the evidence offered serves one of these purposes, the relevant Advisory Committee notes make it clear that the \"only\" conditions justifying the exclusion of the evidence are those described in Rule 403: unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p572\">\n      <span class=\"num\">572</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note to Subdivision (b). The second sentence of Rule 404(b) as submitted to the Congress began with the words \"This subdivision does not exclude the evidence when offered\". The Committee amended this language to read \"It may, however, be admissible\", the words used in the 1971 Advisory Committee draft, on the ground that this formulation properly placed greater emphasis on admissibility than did the final Court version. House Report No. 93-650.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p573\">\n      <span class=\"num\">573</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note to Subdivision (b). This rule provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove character but may be admissible for other specified purposes such as proof of motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p574\">\n      <span class=\"num\">574</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although your committee sees no necessity in amending the rule itself, it anticipates that the use of the discretionary word \"may\" with respect to the admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on the trial judge. Rather, it is anticipated that with respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of those considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e., prejudice, confusion or waste of time. Senate Report No. 93-1277.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p575\">\n      <span class=\"num\">575</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court embraced this understanding of Rule 404(b) and its handling of \"other acts\" in <i>Huddleston v. United States,</i> 485 U.S. 681, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p576\">\n      <span class=\"num\">576</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) &#8212; which applies in both civil and criminal cases &#8212; generally prohibits the introduction of evidence of extrinsic acts that might adversely reflect on the actor's character, unless that evidence bears upon a relevant issue in the case such as motive, opportunity, or knowledge. Extrinsic acts evidence may be critical to the establishment of the truth as to a disputed issue, <i>especially when that issue involves the actor's state of mind and the only means of ascertaining that mental state is by drawing inferences from conduct.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p577\">\n      <span class=\"num\">577</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 685, 108 S.Ct. 1496 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p578\">\n      <span class=\"num\">578</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Court explicitly embraced the Advisory Committee's understanding of the Rule as reflecting the intent of Congress:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p579\">\n      <span class=\"num\">579</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner's reading of Rule 404(b) as mandating a preliminary finding by the trial court that the act in question occurred not only superimposes a level of judicial oversight that is nowhere apparent from the language of that provision, but it is simply inconsistent with the legislative history behind Rule 404(b). The Advisory Committee specifically declined to offer any \"mechanical solution\" to the admission of evidence under 404(b). Rather, the Committee indicated that the trial court should assess such evidence under the usual rules for admissibility: \"The determination must be made whether the danger of undue prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence in view of the availability of other means of proof and other factors appropriate for making decisions of this kind under Rule 403.\" <i>[S]ee also,</i> S Rep No. 93-1277, p 25 (1974) (\"[I]t is anticipated that with respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of those considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e. prejudice, confusion or waste of time\"). Petitioner's suggestion that a preliminary finding is necessary to protect the defendant from the potential for unfair prejudice is also belied by the Reports of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House made clear that the version of Rule 404(b) which became law was intended to \"plac[e] greater emphasis on admissibility than did the final Court verison.\" The Senate echoed this theme: \"[T]he use of the discretionary word `may' with respect to the admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or other acts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on the trial judge.\" Thus, Congress was not nearly so concerned with the potential prejudicial effect of Rule 404(b) evidence as it was with ensuring that restrictions would not be placed on the admission of such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p580\">\n      <span class=\"num\">580</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 688, 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496 (internal citations omitted). Thus, the majority's exclusionary holding defies not only the clear purpose of the Rule itself, but the Supreme Court's authoritative guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p581\">\n      <span class=\"num\">581</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding is not only legally wrong, but it extinguishes the discretion of a district court to decide questions of relevancy, inappropriately converting our standard of review from one that examines for an abuse of discretion into one that looks at a relevancy decision de novo. Their holding is a twistification of the principle that an error of law necessarily renders abusive an exercise of discretion based on that error. Here, there was no error of law. The evidence was relevant, period; and, as we observed in <i>United States v. Hearst,</i> 563 F.2d at 1337, n. 3, \"relevance is the essential criterion.\" Curtin had this evidence on his person when he entered the casino expecting to find \"christy13.\" An officer testified that Curtin \"had a Palm device, a PDA, and he was looking at &#8212; at it. He was looking at the screen [for five minutes] and he kept on looking up as if he was trying to verify the time or location.\" Curtin conceded in his testimony that he personally had downloaded these stories through a computer to his PDA because he believed they were \"quite erotic.\" [Day 4, p. 23] The particular erotic story that attracted his attention was about a \"17 year-old girl,\" and he downloaded them to find more of the same. [Day 4, p. 56] He caused them to be put out on his PDA in December, 2003, just two and one-half months before contacting \"christy13.\" Curtin conceded \"skimming\" some of the downloaded stories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p582\">\n      <span class=\"num\">582</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case in combination with <i>Shymanovitz</i> improperly hamstrings the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Circuit with adults who see children as sexual prey. Congress has enacted a law protecting minors from this behavior, but we have misinterpreted the Rules of Evidence to make the law inordinately difficult to enforce. Without justification, this holding handcuffs jurors when confronted with \"no intent\" defenses, turning such trials into the equivalent of \"he said, she said\" conundrums. My experience with jurors is that confronted with these situations, they want context, corroborating evidence, and other pertinent information which helps them sort out conflicting claims and assertions. Why? Not because it is prejudicial, but because it is relevant, whether it cuts for or against a defendant. As recognized by the Tenth Circuit in <i>Viefhaus</i> and <i>Magleby,</i> context and circumstances are important, and relevant literature can be used to this end &#8212; even if it is obscene. Now, we leave the jury high and dry without relevant evidence to look to in order to ensure the validity of their verdict. Such a handicap is legally wrong as well as unwise. At the very least, the district court's decision regarding the evidence eventually submitted to the jury was far from abusive. If somehow it is correct that <i>Shymanovitz</i> commands this result, then <i>Shymanovitz</i> is seriously defective and must be reconsidered. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This conversation was between Curtin, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Detective Castaneda, and FBI special agent Flaherty.

The majority opinion does not take issue with this analysis. Rather, the majority asserts that as a matter of law, reading material is categorically irrelevant and dissimilar for the purposes of Fed.R.Evid. 401 and 404(b).

From that statement the majority asserts that reading material can never be relevant to any crime. This over-generalization best illustrates the majority's failure to appreciate the fact that the \"offense described\" in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was <i>not</i> a specific intent crime. Thus, because specific intent was not an issue, reading material admitted to show intent would never be relevant.

They exchanged photos early in the conversation. Castaneda sent Curtin a picture of a female police officer, taken when she was fourteen years old. Curtin said his name was \"Kenny\" and that he was forty-two years old, divorced, and living in Anaheim, California. He told Christy that he was planning to travel to Las Vegas on Friday, February 13 and invited her to go to a \"Penn and Teller\" show on Sunday, February 15. Christy agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin extensively discussed sex with Christy during this conversation, saying that he would love for her to \"spend the night\" after the show and hoped to \"get a room.\" Curtin told Christy \"I want to make you happy. . . . If you were masturbating and fantasizing about sex, I'd love to have sex with you.\" He added that they \"could just make out or I could just give you oral sex or we could just fool around.\" Finally, Curtin made plans to meet Christy in the bowling alley of a Las Vegas casino at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, February 15. At the end of the conversation, Curtin asked Christy to try sleeping naked that night, and to \"imagine my face moving between your legs and licking you. Imagine my tongue penetrating you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, Curtin sent Christy an email message saying \"I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to Sunday. We're going to have a great time.\" The detective and Curtin later that day had another \"chat\" during which Curtin continued to make explicit references to having sex with Christy. Curtin concluded the \"chat\" by confirming their meeting and telling Christy he would introduce her to Penn and Teller as his niece, adding, \"Let's not get caught, ever.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that Sunday, the police officer whose picture was sent to Curtin waited in the bowling alley as a decoy, dressed in the clothes that Christy indicated she would be wearing. Eight to ten other law enforcement officers were also present. Curtin entered the bowling alley at 1:45 p.m. and walked towards the area where the decoy officer was sitting. He walked past her and then turned and walked past her again, looking at her each time. Curtin then left the area where the decoy was sitting and went to the back of the bowling alley, where he used his personal digital assistant. At the request of law enforcement officers, a casino security guard approached Curtin and asked for identification. Curtin showed the guard a United States passport and subsequently left the bowling alley area of the casino.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin reentered the bowling alley approximately 2:05 p.m. He looked around and again walked to the area where the decoy officer was sitting. After less than a minute, he moved even closer to her, looking in her direction the entire time. He stopped behind the officer and she turned and said \"hi\" to him. Whether he said \"hi\" in return is disputed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He then left the bowling alley and started getting into a van, at which point law enforcement officers stopped and asked him for identification. He was detained by police and advised of his rights under <i>Miranda.</i> After Curtin waived these rights, he agreed to speak with the law enforcement officers. In a voluntary statement, he stated that he had traveled by car to Las Vegas for meetings. He explained that he was at the bowling alley to meet a female friend he had met on the internet. He admitted to using the screen name and email address used to contact Christy. Curtin explained that he often enters chat rooms and \"role play[s]\" as if he is engaged in \"daddy/daughter\" type conversations, and that he expected Christy to be a thirty- to forty-year-old woman pretending to be a girl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin was then arrested by the Las Vegas police. Upon searching his van and hotel room, police seized his digital assistant and laptop computer. The digital assistant contained over 140 stories about adults having sex with children. The laptop contained a list of chat channels that Curtin had accessed in the past, as well as pictures of girls whose names matched some of those in his \"chat\" list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin was indicted on one count of travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2423(b), and one count of coercion and enticement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2422(b). Curtin filed two motions in limine asking the district court to exclude the stories found on his digital assistant from evidence. The district court denied these motions in limine. On the second day of trial, the government offered two of the stories, \"My Little Sister\" and \"Love for the World,\" to show modus operandi, intent, preparation, and knowledge. They were admitted over Curtin's objection. The engineer who extracted the stories from the digital assistant testified that both stories were about a father having sex with his young daughter and the daughter's enjoyment of the experience. However, when the government sought to introduce a third story, \"Melanie's Busy Day,\" the district court stopped the questioning. The court allowed the government to ask general questions without admitting the stories, such as whether they all related to sex between a minor and an adult. However, recognizing the highly prejudicial nature of the stories, the court held that the story could be entered into evidence only if it tied into Curtin's intent, knowledge, preparation, or modus operandi.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then asked the court to make a preliminary legal determination about the admissibility of the remaining stories. The government argued that \"Melanie's Busy Day\" was admissible to show general intent, modus operandi, preparation, and knowledge because it had language similar to that used by Curtin in his email to Christy, namely, language concerning oral sex and a child masturbating. The government argued that \"Missing Big Brother,\" which discussed how the adult did not want to hurt the child during sex, was also admissible for intent, modus operandi, preparation, and knowledge. The government made similar arguments with regard to seventeen other stories, with titles such as \"I'm Being Molested,\" \"The Good Girl,\" \"A Relative Interest,\" \"Restrictions,\" \"Teaching the Kids,\" and \"Mommy Juice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following morning, Curtin renewed his objection to the admission of the stories, arguing that they were highly prejudicial and were being admitted to show propensity. The district court held that if the government could cite a part of the story that related to one of the permissible purposes under Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 404(b), then the court would admit the entire story to show general intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court admitted to being unable to read the stories because they were so disturbing. \"I thought about this problem overnight because I want to address the relative overwhelming prejudice versus the purpose. I read the first story and a little bit of the second. <i>That's as far as I could get,</i> which is confirming [defense counsel's] statement. It has a tendency to overwhelm you and overwhelm the jury.\" However, after more argument, the district court agreed to give a limiting instruction and to admit five of the stories: \"My Little Sister\" (which involved incest and the impregnation of a nine year-old girl), \"Love for the World\" (which involved incest), \"Restrictions\" (same), \"Daddy's Lessons\" (same), and \"Melanie's Busy Day\" (which involved an eleven-year-old girl initiating sex with, among others, her father and her teacher).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The limiting instruction given was as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person cannot be charged nor convicted of literature that they read or that they possess.

Curtin was charged with traveling across state lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, and with attempting to persuade a minor to engage in sex. The possession or content of the stories was not a part of the \"transaction\" that led to the present charges. Second, the admission of the stories was not required for the prosecution to \"offer a coherent story.\" The prosecution would have had no difficulty in presenting all relevant evidence, including the \"chat\" conversations, Curtin's admission that he was \"M-42SOCAL,\" and Curtin's behavior at the meeting place, without the admission of the stories.

Shymanovitz was a middle-school guidance counselor who was charged with sexually and physically abusing several of the boys under his supervision. <i>Id.</i> at 1155. Prior to trial, the government sought to introduce two magazine articles from sexually explicit magazines found in Shymanovitz's home, arguing that they were relevant to establishing intent. The articles were both presumably fictional stories. One depicted sex between a father and son, while the other depicted sex between a priest and a child. The court deferred ruling on the motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court permitted a police officer to testify that at Shymanovitz's house she seized, among other things, condoms, surgical gloves, children's underwear, and sexually explicit magazines. The officer testified in great detail, over defense counsel's objections, about the contents of four of these magazines. She told the jury that the magazines contained explicit photographs of homosexual sex and described the photographs and the contents of the two articles in detail. The two articles were subsequently entered into evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 1155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both <i>Shymanovitz</i> and this appeal address whether the reading material at issue was admissible under Rule 404(b). We concluded in <i>Shymanovitz</i> that the magazine articles failed to constitute a Rule 404(b) \"bad act.\" \"[P]ossession of lawful reading material is simply not the type of conduct contemplated by Rule 404(b).\" <i>Id.</i> at 1159. Additionally, we held that possession of lawful reading material was not similar to actual criminal conduct, thus failing the third criterion of the <i>Spillone</i> test. \"[T]here is simply no doubt that a wide gulf separates the act of <i>possessing</i> written descriptions or stories about criminal conduct from the act of <i>committing</i> the offenses described.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the issue of similarity, <i>Shymanovitz</i> conforms with the rest of our case law. In <i>Vizcarra-Martinez,</i> the defendant was charged with conspiracy to possess a chemical with reason to believe it would be used to make methamphetamine. 66 F.3d at 1009. The district court admitted evidence that Vizcarra-Martinez was in possession of a personal-use amount of methamphetamine at the time of his arrest. We reversed. \"We simply cannot assume... that Vizcarra-Martinez's use of methamphetamine tended to prove that he knew that the chemical in his possession would be used in the methamphetamine manufacturing process.\" <i>Vizcarra-Martinez,</i> 66 F.3d at 1015. The cases in which we have allowed Rule 404(b) evidence show a much stronger connection between the \"other act,\" which is often a crime in itself, and the charged crime. In <i>United States v. Vo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790901\"><a href=\"/opinion/790901/united-states-v-rick-k-vo/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span>, 1018-19 (9th Cir.2005), where the defendant was charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, we allowed the admission of a prior conviction for drug selling. \"Vo's prior conviction was evidence of his knowledge of drug trafficking and distribution in general. The conviction tended to show that Vo was familiar with distribution of illegal drugs and that his actions in this case were not an accident or a mistake.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1019.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Shymanovitz</i> does recognize a narrow exception for \"modus operandi\" evidence: evidence involving acts by the defendant that are \"so nearly identical in method as to ear-mark the charged offense the handiwork of the accused and that are so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1159 n. 9 (internal punctuation and citation omitted). \"[U]se of modus operandi evidence is rare, and the similarities must be specific and detailed and clearly set the particular offense apart from the general body of such offenses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence in this case is not sufficiently detailed and specific to fall within the exception. The stories did not describe specific methods of committing the first offense with which Curtin was charged: traveling across state borders to have sex with a minor. Rather, the stories mostly involved explicit descriptions of incest. Thus, the stories do not reveal a relevant modus operandi to commit the charged crime, and are inadmissible. The issue is closer with regard to the charge of use of an interstate facility to attempt to persuade a minor to engage in sex. The government argued that the language in the stories was similar to the language used by Curtin in his \"chat\" conversations. We conclude that <i>Shymanovitz</i> forecloses our acceptance of the government's position. The conduct with which Curtin was charged, and the language that Curtin used, can \"hardly be construed as either distinctive or remarkable in the universe of sexual offenses against minors.\" <i>Id.

We allowed the introduction of \"skinhead and white supremacist evidence,\" including color photographs of the defendant's tattoos (e.g., swastikas), Nazi-related literature, group photographs including some of the defendants (e.g., in \"Heil Hitler\" poses and standing before a swastika that they later set on fire), and other skinhead paraphernalia. <i>Id.</i> at 885-86. We distinguished <i>Shymanovitz:</i> \"Key to our reasoning [in <i>Shymanovitz</i>] was the fact that the testimony . . . was not relevant to proving any of the elements of the crime for which the defendant was convicted....\" <i>Id.</i> at 887 n. 25.

First, many of the items admitted into evidence in <i>Allen</i> involved more than the possession of reading material. The defendants were active participants in \"Heil Hitler\" poses and had posed with and burned a large swastika. Second, unlike in <i>Shymanovitz,</i> there is no indication that the reading material in <i>Allen</i> was fictional. Third, the evidence at issue in this case, and in <i>Shymanovitz,</i> was extremely prejudicial. Finally, it is possible that the evidence in <i>Allen</i> would have been admissible under the \"inextricably intertwined\" exception outlined above.

But even if <i>Shymanovitz</i> involves slightly different facts, its legal rule does not distinguish between specific intent crimes and other crimes. \"Under the government's theory, the case against an accused child molester would be stronger if he owned a copy of Nabokov's <i>Lolita,</i> and any murder defendant would be unfortunate to have in his possession a collection of Agatha Christie mysteries. . . . \" <i>Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d at 1159. Put simply, <i>Shymanovitz</i> is replete with language that dictates the outcome of this appeal. We may not ignore its controlling effect on this case. <i>See Barapind v. Enomoto,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></span>, 751 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc) (per curiam).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent's discussion of cases like <i>United States v. McCollum,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434946\"><a href=\"/opinion/434946/united-states-v-larry-eugene-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1419</span></a></span>, 1425 (9th Cir.1984), which involve the admission of similar prior criminal convictions to prove intent, is equally off point. In <i>McCollum,</i> we allowed admission of a prior conviction for armed robbery to negate the defendant's defense of acting under hypnosis. The relationship between the prior crime and the act charged is obviously far closer in McCollum's case than it is in Curtin's. Curtin's case involves otherwise lawful reading material that is not similar to the crime with which he is being charged. Essentially, the government here seeks to introduce possession of material that describes one type of criminal conduct, namely incest with minors, to prove intent to commit another type of criminal conduct, namely crossing state borders to have sex with a minor. This is impermissible under our caselaw.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also argues at length that Curtin's case is different because Curtin was actually in possession of the stories at the time of his arrest. However, the government never argued relevance based on physical possession. In any event, this is a fallacious distinction because the stories were saved as documents to Curtin's handheld computer. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we should not infer that Curtin planned to \"use\" the stories or had the stories in mind simply because he was carrying his computer at the time of his arrest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the dissent's assertion, we have not \"made relevant literature off limits in the Ninth Circuit as a matter of law.\" Nor do we \"hamstring[ ] the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Circuit with adults who see children as sexual prey.\" As pointed out above, in this case the prosecution may rely on Curtin's presence in a chat room called \"ltgirlsexchat,\" the \"chat\" conversations themselves, Curtin's admission that he was \"M-42SOCAL,\" and Curtin's behavior at the meeting place</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In terms of otherwise lawfully-possessed literature, modus operandi evidence and inextricably intertwined evidence remain admissible. Here, however, the jury was asked \"to infer from behavior on one occasion something about the nature of a person and then to infer from that how the person probably would have behaved on another occasion when the only connection between the two occasions is that the[jury] believes that people of a certain type would act the same way both times.\" 1 Stephen A. Saltzburg et al., Federal Rules of Evidence Manual &#167; 404.02[9](8th ed.2002). Without more of a connection between the literature and the accused crimes, the literature is no more than character evidence introduced to show propensity, , and highly prejudicial character evidence at that.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">The dissent argues at length that the evidence was necessary to refute Curtin's testimony and \"aggressive defense\" of his intent to meet an adult, and attempts to distinguish <i>Shymanovitz</i> because Curtin actually testified. However, the stories were not offered for impeachment, on which we express no opinion. Nor do we believe that the stories were necessary given the strength of other evidence introduced by the government. In any event, evidence is not admissible solely because it may be necessary or helpful. Wholly apart from its prejudicial effect, we have held that \"[t]he mere possession of reading material that describes a particular type of activity makes it neither more nor less likely that a defendant would intentionally engage in the conduct described and thus fails to meet the test of relevancy under Rule 401.\" <i>Shymanovitz,</i> 157 F.3d at 1158. Here, the materials in Curtin's possession told stories of incestuous sexual acts that were different from those he was accused of intending to perpetrate. They were offered as substantive evidence of guilt, and we simply hold that their admission in this case was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">TROTT, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the 20th Century, the four walls of a family's home provided substantial protection from marauding sexual predators on the prowl for children and unsuspecting minors to assault. Locked doors and windows could normally safeguard a dwelling from invasion, as well as shelter parents' vulnerable children from harm. Distant parks, playgrounds, malls, and sidewalks surrounding school yards were the child molester's preferred hunting grounds. No longer. Now, the Internet is upon us, and it allows cunning sexual vultures repeatedly to enter the bedrooms of immature children where, by seductive and calculating means, unwary children are enticed to leave the security of their homes and to venture into unspeakable dangers. Moreover, the invaders themselves do so invisibly, appearing only on a video screen, unseen by the unsuspecting adults on site. This case provides an example of this frightful situation which generations not yet familiar with the dark side of the Internet have been slow to recognize.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the walls of our homes breached by the Internet, our next best defense is the law. Unfortunately, this case reveals that the laws and the rules of evidence upon which society relies to protect itself from cruel deviancy are now as porous as the walls of our homes, allowing lawbreakers to pull the wool over the eyes of the jurors delegated to ensure that our laws are faithfully implemented. It seems that the law of relevancy is now more concerned with protecting a sexual predator's obscene manuals on what to do to children than with protecting the real children upon whom they practice their perversions, as this case illustrates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin's explanation to the jury for his Internet behavior with \"christy13\" and trip to Las Vegas was that he intended to act out an incestuous sexual fantasy with her, but that he expected her to be an adult who would pretend to be his innocent unspoiled daughter. Although he called his sexual fantasy \"daddy daughter,\" he denied that the \"daughter\" would be a minor. If worthy of belief, this intent would defeat the prosecution's case, which required proof of an intent to engage a minor in unlawful sexual activity. However, Curtin had on his person at the time of his anticipated encounter with \"christy13\" obscene literature tending without ambiguity to prove that the object of his incest fantasy was a child, not an adult. My respected colleagues conclude that the district court erred in admitting this inculpatory literature because &#8212; <i>as a matter of law</i> &#8212; it was not relevant. I disagree. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* The evidence developed against Kevin Curtin by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department suggests on its face that he is a dangerous predatory pedophile who uses the Internet electronically to enter the homes of his immature juvenile female victims in order to lure them into danger. Curtin's M.O., or modus operandi, involving calculated \"grooming\" and enticement is well known to the police who work this detail. Here, Curtin contacted his prey through a chat room called \"ltgirlsexchat,\" which, according to the evidence, is a place on the Internet where people go to talk sex with little girls. The evidence reveals also that he planned a family cover story for his time with his victim. He, as Uncle Kevin, would introduce her as his \"niece.\" In addition, he asked her if she was working with the police in order \"to get guys who make out with 14-year-old girls.\" These aspects of the government's evidence would seem to portray the subjective intent required by the charges filed against him and a keen awareness of the unlawful nature of what he was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But wait, he protests, what you see and what you read on my exchanges with \"christy13\" is not what you get. I'm not an online predator trolling for naive juveniles, my true intent &#8212; hard to discern though it may be &#8212; is to sexually hook-up with mature females who are hanging out in juvenile chat rooms posing as minors. I'm merely a \"lonely divorcee [sic] looking for an older woman who may have a place to go,\" because I do not have a place of my own. It's just a game of role playing. \"[N]ormally in this sort of thing it would be a fantasy. Sort of like daddy/daughter or along those lines.\" My real intent was to hook up with a thirty to forty year-old role playing woman pretending to be 14-year-old who was interested in actualizing such an incestuous sexual fantasy, certainly not a minor. But of course, this is \"my first time.\" \"I haven't ever kissed anyone but my wife since &#8212; in fifteen years.\" And, by the way, \"no one ever sends a picture of what they actually look like.\" Moreover, everything I wrote to \"christy13\" that makes it appear that I understood her to be a minor?

Both charges required the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtin acted with the intent to engage a person under the age of eighteen years in unlawful sexual behavior. To quote the court in its concluding instructions to the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order for the defendant to be found guilty of [&#167; 2423(b)], the Government must prove each of the following elements, beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the defendant used a facility or means of interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defendant knowingly intended to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce Christy into engaging in sexual activity for which he could be prosecuted under the laws of the state of Nevada.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the defendant believed Christy had not attained the age of 16 years....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the laws of the state of Nevada, it is an offense to commit statutory sexual seduction.

Curtin went so far as to file a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the \"undisputed and uncontested facts\" made it patently obvious that the government had \"no credible evidence to suggest that [Curtin's] subjective intentions were to travel to Las Vegas to have sex with a minor\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Curtin did not possess an intent to have sex with a 14 year old girl when he got into his car and drove to Las Vegas; the overwhelming evidence points the other way. His voluntary statement, given minutes after he was stopped by the police, shows this. He thought it was all too easy, that no 14 year old was going to just hop into bed with a 42 year old after two chat sessions, especially a pretty girl. As he said in his statement, her Mary Poppins naivety was <i>beyond any level of credence.</i> It was so easy and uncredible that he even wondered if it could have been police. In any event, he was not concerned, because when he left California to go to Las Vegas, he was going to find work, and at the time he left California to travel to Nevada, he had no intentions of having relations with a minor, as irrebuttably shown by the fact that he did not so much as talk to the person. This meeting was the litmus test of his true intentions in this nebulous and hazy situation. He clearly and without question passed this test. When he calmly and simply walked away, the police wanted to know why. He told them. He clearly and unequivocally explained that he did not talk to this person because he stopped by the Suncoast with the hope and intentions of meeting an older woman. HAD HE BEEN THERE TO MEET A MINOR, AS IS THE CRUX OF THIS INDICTMENT, THEN HE WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED HIMSELF AT THAT POINT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... Curtin's intentions were to try to meet a 30-40 year old woman who had been fantasizing. It is not even close....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the defendant's intent was not to have sex with a minor, nor to entice a minor, nor to travel interstate to have sex with a minor, . . . this case must be dismissed. In the instant case, the defendant did not think he was dealing with a minor. The police knew there [was] not a minor and in fact there was not a minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the line was drawn by Curtin. His defense was a matter of record. The trial would be about intent and what was in Curtin's mind during his undisputed conduct with \"christy13.\" This was the issue, the only issue: subjective intentions. As counsel for Curtin said in his opening statement, \"[Curtin] thought it was someone his age that he was dealing with and that they would role play in a situation much like a dad and a daughter.\" Counsel concluded on this what-was-in-Curtin's-mind theme by telling the jury that \"this is the type of crime that is a situation where you have to look at the thoughts.\" To prevail, of course, Curtin would not be called upon to satisfy the jury that his defense was true. All he had to do is raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a single juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Confronted with Curtin's aggressive fantasy intent defense &#8212; to sexually play daddy/daughter incest, not with a minor but with an adult &#8212; and facing the traditional daunting burden of proof, the government offered stories contained on Curtin's PDA, or \"personal digital assistant.\" These stories were offered pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) for two equally appropriate purposes: (1) to prove that Curtin harbored the subjective intent made unlawful by law, and (2) to rebut Curtin's defense that the daughter in his daddy/daughter sexual fantasy was an adult pretending to be a child. From the beginning, the government was put on notice by the court that in order for the stories to be properly admitted, each story would have to comport to the admissibility conditions of Fed. R.Evid. 401 and 404(b) as well as the probative versus prejudice limitations found in Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What was the content of the material on Curtin's PDA?

If your child is old enough to understand what I'm saying, he or she must hear it along with you. These are TRUTHS that even children must learn. So gather around; call the children, and listen to the truth that has been revealed to me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In today's world, parents have a special duty towards their children. Gone are the days when we could pretend children were `innocent' of the facts of life. Today's children, before they turn ten, and some even before first grade, know what sex is ... And many of them have already developed an interest that some parents may feel uncomfortable with. That discomfort, is the matter I am going to address tonight; and what you must do, to not just overcome it, but to find true joy in doing the work of the Lord, by properly teaching your children the true JOY of sex, when practiced with those you love.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For it is truly up to the parents to steer their children right: into a healthy outlook on matters of sex.

Shymanovitz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758521\"><a href=\"/opinion/758521/98-cal-daily-op-serv-6769-98-daily-journal-dar-9403-people-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 1998), does not dictate the outcome of this case, and its holding does not as a matter of law render abusive the district court's exercise of discretion. In the parlance of the profession, <i>Shymanovitz</i> is distinguishable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p214\">\n      <span class=\"num\">214</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, unlike the specific intent crimes with which Curtin was charged, the combination of crimes in <i>Shymanovitz</i> &#8212; generally unlawful sexual activity with minors &#8212; required an entirely different type of mens rea from the specific intent required here. One of the crimes charged in <i>Shymanovitz,</i> \"sexual penetration,\" did \"not include any requirement that the defendant act with intent,\" <i>id.</i> at 1157, just that the defendant have engaged in sexual penetration with the victim. The other crime, sexual contact with a minor, required touching that was intentional rather than accidental. Moreover, the actual purpose of the person doing the touching was immaterial. As Judge Reinhardt explained,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p215\">\n      <span class=\"num\">215</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he charges based on sexual contact require the government to prove that any touching on Shymanovitz' part was intentional, and that a reasonable person could construe the touching to be for a sexual purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p216\">\n      <span class=\"num\">216</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Shymanovitz's <i>actual</i> purpose in touching the alleged victims was sexual arousal or gratification, however, or whether he was <i>actually</i> aroused or gratified by the touching is <i>immaterial</i> to the offenses, including the charges based on improper sexual contact. Instead, the question in the latter category of cases is whether a reasonable person could construe the touching to be for such a purpose. <i>The test, under the sexual contact statute, is an objective not a subjective one.</i> In short, it is the <i>character</i> of the touching that is at issue, <i>not the purpose of the intentional toucher.</i> Accordingly, the government's current and sole justification for admitting the challenged evidence goes, <i>once again, to the proof of an element immaterial to the offense.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p217\">\n      <span class=\"num\">217</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1158 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p218\">\n      <span class=\"num\">218</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the defense in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was not that the alleged touching and penetration were not accompanied by any requisite state of mind, but that the acts charged as crimes never happened. \"His counsel argued that the boys and some of the parents had concocted the allegations against him....\" <i>Id.</i> at 1154. Moreover, Shymanovitz</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p219\">\n      <span class=\"num\">219</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... never testified at trial that he believed sexual conduct with minors to be legal. Nor was there testimony to indicate that he somehow lacked knowledge of or familiarity with fellatio, anal intercourse, or other general aspects of homosexual sex. Moreover, neither knowledge of the illegality of the conduct of which he was accused nor knowledge of the nature of the specific acts identified by the prosecutor constituted an element of the offense. More important, such knowledge would in no way tend to prove his guilt on any of the charges brought against him. Accordingly, it is highly unlikely that the government introduced the magazines to address the issues it argued they were relevant to during the prosecutor's closing arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p220\">\n      <span class=\"num\">220</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1156.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p221\">\n      <span class=\"num\">221</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, Curtin did testify at the trial, tendering an energetic defense that his intent was to couple with an adult female, not a juvenile. Shymanovitz's defense had nothing to do with intent or state of mind.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p222\">\n      <span class=\"num\">222</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the stories were in Curtin's possession when he entered the casino in order to meet his target. Not so in <i>Shymanovitz.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p223\">\n      <span class=\"num\">223</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, given that the evidence under scrutiny in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was (1) not probative of <i>any</i> issue in the case, and (2) not relevant to Shymanovitz's factual defense, it was appropriate for the panel to conclude as a matter of law that it was not properly received pursuant to Rule 401 or 404(b). The evidence simply failed Rule 401's definition of relevancy and, therefore, also failed Rule 404(b). The evidence did not illuminate \"a fact of consequence to the determination of the action,\" and was nothing more than an attempt to slime the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 1154(referring to the prosecutor's \"untempered and provocative references\" to the evidence).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p224\">\n      <span class=\"num\">224</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognized the limited reach of <i>Shymanovitz</i> in <i>United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783367\"><a href=\"/opinion/783367/united-states-v-sean-allen-united-states-of-america-v-eric-adam-dixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2003). The defendants in <i>Allen</i> were charged with intimidating or interfering with a person's housing rights on account of race or color, in violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631. In order to satisfy the statute's requirement of a showing of racial animus, the government offered, and we admitted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p225\">\n      <span class=\"num\">225</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... skinhead and white supremacist evidence, including color photographs of their tattoos (e.g., swastikas and other symbols of white supremacy), Nazi-related literature, group photographs including some of the defendants (e.g., in \"Heil Hitler\" poses and standing before a large swastika that they later set on fire), and skinhead paraphernalia (e.g. combat boots, arm-bands with swastikas, and a registration form for the Aryan Nations World Congress).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p226\">\n      <span class=\"num\">226</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 885-886. The district court ruled (1) that this potentially inflammatory evidence was relevant to proving the defendants' motive, intent and plan, and (2) that its prejudicial potential did not substantially outweigh its probative value as demanded by Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p227\">\n      <span class=\"num\">227</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the <i>Allen</i> defendants challenged the trial court's ruling on the ground that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial. We disagreed, relying in large measure on our decision in <i>United States v. Skillman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553883\"><a href=\"/opinion/553883/united-states-of-america-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-gary-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1991), a race-motivated cross burning case wherein \"skinhead\" literature and materials found in Skillman's garage and on his person at the time of his arrest was used to prove Skillman's state of mind at the time of the crime, even though the government could not establish that Skillman was a skinhead. In <i>Skillman</i> we said,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p228\">\n      <span class=\"num\">228</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Skillman principally relies on <i>United States v.

Skillman also contends that the skinhead references were cumulative to other animus evidence, including Exhibit 3, the business card with the racist poem found in his wallet as well as Milum's and Becky's testimony on Skillman's prior race statements. We conclude this evidence was not \"needless[ly]\" cumulative in light of the difficulty in establishing the requisite racial animus <i>and Skillman's theory-of-defense that he was a mere passive bystander at the crime.</i> The district court's evaluation under Rule 403 and the admission of the evidence was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p229\">\n      <span class=\"num\">229</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">922 F.2d at 1374 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p230\">\n      <span class=\"num\">230</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, because we perceived in <i>Allen</i> the difference between cases involving specific intent and those that do not, we had no difficulty explaining why <i>Shymanovitz,</i> like <i>Gillespie,</i> was inapposite:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p231\">\n      <span class=\"num\">231</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants cite to our decision in <i>Guam v.

In <i>Shymanovitz,</i> we concluded that the district court abused its discretion by allowing the government to introduce testimony about the contents of magazines found at the defendant's apartment, including photographs of men masturbating, ejaculating, using sex toys, and engaging in oral and anal sex (among other things), to prove the defendant's intent in committing sexual acts with minors. 157 F.3d at 1155. <i>Key to our reasoning was the fact that the testimony was highly prejudicial</i> <i>and was not relevant to proving any of the elements of the crime for which the defendant was convicted (unlawful sexual activity with minors). Id.</i> at 1157-60. <i>In contrast, the skinhead and white supremacy evidence here was relevant to proving the element of intent</i> in both &#167;&#167; 241 and 245(b)(2)(B). <i>Moreover, in light of the government's heavy burden of proving racial animus, we conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the evidence.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p232\">\n      <span class=\"num\">232</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Allen,</i> 341 F.3d at 887, n. 25 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p233\">\n      <span class=\"num\">233</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">My colleagues attempt &#8212; unconvincingly I believe &#8212; to distinguish <i>Allen</i> on the basis of insignificant differences between the evidence in <i>Allen</i> and the evidence here. They point out (1) that \"the evidence in <i>Allen</i> involved more than the possession of reading material,\" including photographs showing some of the defendants as active participants in \"Heil Hitler\" poses, (2) that the Nazi literature in <i>Allen</i> may not have been \"fictional,\" and (3) that \"the evidence in this case, and in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was extremely prejudicial,\" apparently as opposed to the evidence in <i>Allen.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p234\">\n      <span class=\"num\">234</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These minor differences are utterly insufficient to render <i>Allen</i> inapposite. First, that <i>Allen</i> involved evidence in addition to reading material is inconsequential, as each \"offer of evidence is to be evaluated independently under the Federal Rules of Evidence and the relevant case law.\" <i>United States v. Bertoli,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></span>, 1079 (D.N.J.1994) <i>vacated in part on unrelated grounds,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"683142\"><a href=\"/opinion/683142/united-states-v-richard-o-bertoli/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1384</span></a></span> (3d Cir.1994). Second, I fail to see any material difference between real stories of sexual perversion and fictional stories of the same ilk. Both serve to excite sexual criminals and to fuel their perverted intentions. Moreover, whether a story's plot is fictional is not material to the question of whether the content of that story relates to and is similar to the conduct of the alleged criminal &#8212; thereby satisfying the requirements of Rules 401 and 404(b). Third, the majority's assertion that \"the evidence at issue in this case and in <i>Shymanovitz</i> [as opposed to <i>Allen</i>] was extremely prejudicial,\" and thus distinguishable, fails to appreciate how the rules of evidence operate. Prejudice is a separate basis for exclusion that requires an independent analysis under Fed.R.Evid. 403 after it is determined that an offer of evidence is relevant and admissible. <i>See Weisgram v. Marley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118337\"><a href=\"/opinion/118337/weisgram-v-marley-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 453 n. 9, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118337\"><a href=\"/opinion/118337/weisgram-v-marley-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As admitted by my colleges, the prejudice argument was waived by Curtin and is not an issue before us.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p235\">\n      <span class=\"num\">235</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the majority's reasons for distinguishing <i>Allen</i> are inadequate, especially when viewed in the light of the \"literary\" evidence approved in <i>Skillman</i> on which <i>Allen</i> relied. The evidence in <i>Skillman</i> included a \"poem containing racial epithets\" on the back of a business card in Skillman's pocket. We did not segregate out of our holding in <i>Allen,</i> the Nazi literature in his possession. Although literature per se has no special protection in this context as evidence &#8212; under the First Amendment or otherwise &#8212; my colleagues have effectively made relevant literature categorically off-limits as a source of evidence as to a person's subjective intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p236\">\n      <span class=\"num\">236</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One way to test the relevancy of Curtin's recent PDA downloads (and to illustrate the difference between the setting here and the circumstances in <i>Shymanovitz</i>) is to envision what we would certainly hold if Curtin's PDA stories<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> were of role playing daddy/daughter incest with female adults &#8212; not minors &#8212; and the district court had excluded the stories as \"irrelevant.\" Curtin would have attempted to admit the stories into evidence to demonstrate that he intended to meet an adult. Without a doubt, a convicted Curtin would assert on appeal that the content of the stories shed light on his subjective intent and &#8212; as counsel put it to the jurors &#8212; his \"thoughts\" as he communicated with \"christy13,\" and as he traveled interstate with the stories in his pocket to meet her; and there is no doubt that we would agree. Why? Because the stories would have a \"tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Fed.R.Evid. 401. Such stories would corroborate his claim of adult incest fantasy. How else could he do that without evidence of \"other acts,\" as they are called? Conversely, the absence of such adult stories coupled with the presence of stories wherein children are the objects of the sexual appetites of adults is equally relevant to prove the government's case and to confront Curtin's defense.

In some instances, scientific research may show that the fact in issue is more likely to be true (or false) when such evidence is present than when it is not. <i>Ordinarily, however, the answer must lie in the judge's own experience, [the judge's] general knowledge, and [the judge's] understanding of human conduct and motivation.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p239\">\n      <span class=\"num\">239</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.,</i> &#167; 184 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p240\">\n      <span class=\"num\">240</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Internet \"sting\" cases such as this involving claims of entrapment, the issue of what a defendant's state of mind was immediately prior to his contact with a sexual target purporting to be a minor is routinely a serious point of contention. We call the issue one of \"predisposition,\" and it is primarily a question of fact. In <i>United States v. Poehlman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769300\"><a href=\"/opinion/769300/united-states-v-mark-douglas-poehlman/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2000), for example, Poehlman, a cross-dresser, was charged with willingly crossing state lines to have sex with minors, but it appeared that when first contacted by the government, he was looking for adults with whom to engage in his \"proclivities,\" not children. However, the undercover officer with whom he was corresponding deftly turned Poehlman's prurient interest to children, and he responded accordingly. In court, charged with a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2423(b), Poehlman relied on his initial interest in adults to demonstrate a lack of predisposition to involve minors in his sexual plans, arguing that the government took advantage of that lawful interest and unlawfully used it to steer him to children. In concluding that he had indeed been entrapped, we said, \"The government thus played on Poehlman's obvious need for an adult relationship, for acceptance of his sexual proclivities and for a family, to draw him even deeper into a sexual fantasy world involving these imaginary girls.\" <i>Id.</i> at 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p241\">\n      <span class=\"num\">241</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To what evidence did we look to verify a factually fatal lack of predisposition on Poehlman's part to target minors? The same kind of material we now place \"off limits\" as a matter of law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p242\">\n      <span class=\"num\">242</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By analogy, the fact that Poehlman willingly crossed state lines to have sex with minors after his prolonged and steamy correspondence with Sharon cannot, alone, support a finding of predisposition. It is possible, after all, that it was the government's inducement that brought Poehlman to the point where he became willing to break the law. <i>As in Jacobson, we must consider what evidence there is as to Poehlman's state of mind prior to his contact with Sharon.</i> On this score, the record is sparse indeed; it is easier to say <i>what the record does not confirm than what it does.</i> The government produced no e-mails or chat room postings where Poehlman expressed an interest in sex with children, or even the view that sex with children should be legalized. <i>Nor did the government produce any notes, tapes, magazines, photographs, letters or similar items which disclosed an interest in sex with children, despite a thorough search of Poehlman's home. There was no testimony from the playmates of Poehlman's children, his ex-wife or anyone else indicating that Poehlman had behaved inappropriately toward children or otherwise manifested a sexual interest in them.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p243\">\n      <span class=\"num\">243</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Although the admission of the lyrics to the Screwdriver song was certainly harmful to Mr. Magleby's case, we conclude that its probative value outweighed its prejudicial effect. This evidence is probative both of Mr. Magleby's racial animus under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631(a) and of his intent under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p252\">\n      <span class=\"num\">252</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

In <i>Viefhaus,</i> the defendant was convicted of making threats against, interalia, African-Americans, Jews, and federal law enforcement on an answering machine \"hotline.\" <i>The defendant asserted as a defense that he lacked the intent requisite to make a true threat.</i> We upheld the admission of racially inflammatory items as relevant to the defendant's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p253\">\n      <span class=\"num\">253</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p254\">\n      <span class=\"num\">254</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As did the defendant in <i>Viefhaus,</i> Mr. Magleby denies having the requisite intent under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3631(a) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241. The lyrics to the Screwdriver song, as well as the evidence that Mr. Magleby knew the lyrics and could sing along with them, are probative of his intent under these sections. First, &#167; 3631(a) requires that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Magleby targeted the Henrys because of their race. <i>The lyrics and Mr. Magleby's familiarity with them are probative of his racial animus in burning the cross.</i> Second, under &#167; 241, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Magleby had the specific intent to \"oppress, threaten or intimidate\" the Henrys in the enjoyment of their federally protected right to occupy property. <i>Context is important in determining whether a true threat has been made.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p255\">\n      <span class=\"num\">255</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p256\">\n      <span class=\"num\">256</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessity of demonstrating the context in which the cross was burned renders the Screwdriver lyrics and other evidence of hostility toward the presence of African-Americans in this country intrinsic to a violation of &#167; 241. And, as in <i>Viefhaus,</i> the only way the jury could properly determine the message conveyed by Mr. Magleby's cross-burning and the foreseeable effect it would have on the Henrys was to examine the circumstances in which the cross-burning was conceived, planned, and executed. We fine that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the song lyrics into evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p257\">\n      <span class=\"num\">257</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1319 (emphasis added).

Take the case of Larry McCollum. McCollum claimed that although he entered a bank and gave an employee a note demanding $100,000 he had \"no criminal intent\" to commit robbery because he was acting involuntarily under the influence of hypnosis. The district court admitted a prior conviction for armed robbery to counter his defense of a lack of intent. We affirmed, holding as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p259\">\n      <span class=\"num\">259</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, ... the defense conceded that McCollum performed all acts charged by the prosecution. The key issue, indeed the only disputed issue, was whether McCollum acted with intent to rob the bank. Where the mental state to be inferred from undisputed overt acts of a defendant is the crucial issue, evidence of past criminal acts has generally been found insufficiently prejudicial to warrant exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p260\">\n      <span class=\"num\">260</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Obscenity, which is described as a work which appeals to the prurient interest and which describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which when judged by contemporary community standards lacks serious literacy, artistic, political, or scientific value, is not protected by the First Amendment. <i>Miller v.

By the above reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, this court clearly may admit literature in the possession of the defendant for the purpose of proving an element of the crime.

They want to proffer some additional exhibits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p553\">\n      <span class=\"num\">553</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, therefore, I'm going to give you a brief instruction with respect to these exhibits. I gave you, initially, the same instruction yesterday. I'm going to give you the official version and then explain it briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p554\">\n      <span class=\"num\">554</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are about to hear testimony that the defendant had articles on his PDA that relate to other acts not charged here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p555\">\n      <span class=\"num\">555</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted only for the limited purpose of being considered by you on the question of the defendant's intent, method, preparation, or knowledge, and for no other purpose. Let me explain the instruction just briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p556\">\n      <span class=\"num\">556</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We all have, thank goodness, a constitutional right to have whatever literature we want in our homes, on our PDAs, on our computers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p557\">\n      <span class=\"num\">557</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A person cannot be charged nor convicted of literature that they read or that they possess. That's why I'm giving you the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p558\">\n      <span class=\"num\">558</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the Government has the obligation to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had the wrongful intent. They may offer possession of such literature to show that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p559\">\n      <span class=\"num\">559</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, most all crimes, state or federal, have, at a minimum, at least two elements. I'll instruct you at the end of the case on what the elements of these crimes are. And the Government must prove every one of them, beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p560\">\n      <span class=\"num\">560</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But most all crimes have a minimum of two elements: One, some conduct that's specified in the statute; and number two, a wrongful state of mind or intent. The simplest example I can think of is murder. There is an act, homicide. And there's a wrongful intent, the wrongful taking of another person's life. If you don't have that intent, you haven't committed the crime. If you're involved in an accident in your car and, unfortunately, someone loses their life in that accident, you are not guilty of murder. There is a homicide, to be sure, but there is no wrongful intent. And, therefore, you're not charged, nor convicted, nor alleged with committing a criminal act. You may be sued in court civilly, of course. Therefore, there are two elements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p561\">\n      <span class=\"num\">561</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may take this kind of evidence on the question of whether the defendant actually possessed the intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p562\">\n      <span class=\"num\">562</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You may also take it on the additional questions which go to the question of intent, whether he practiced in this alleged conduct methodology consistent with literature that he had or tending to show that he prepared to commit the acts or that he had knowledge, that is, of how to commit the act or that the act was illegal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p563\">\n      <span class=\"num\">563</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, the prosecution does not have to show that a defendant knew an act was illegal, simply that he committed the act and that he knew it was wrongful or that he had the wrongful intent. They don't have to prove that he knew it was illegal. But evidence tending to show that he knew it was illegal may or may not tend to show that he had the intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p564\">\n      <span class=\"num\">564</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So, for those four reasons, only, the Government is offering to show that the defendant possessed this literature; intent, method, preparation, and knowledge. And you may only take it for that purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p565\">\n      <span class=\"num\">565</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, you have a constitutional right. You have that right. You would want to protect the defendant's right to possess any kind of literature and to read it or not read it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p566\">\n      <span class=\"num\">566</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You must not allow this kind of evidence to bias you, generally, against the defendant on the ultimate question of guilt or innocence. You must not do that. I'll repeat, finally, in conclusion, the official instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p567\">\n      <span class=\"num\">567</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are about to hear testimony that the defendant possessed various types of articles on his PDA regarding other acts not charged here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p568\">\n      <span class=\"num\">568</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I instruct you that the testimony is being admitted only for the limited purpose of being considered by you on the question of the defendant's intent, method, preparation, or knowledge and for no other purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p569\">\n      <span class=\"num\">569</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I hope you understand the instruction.

My colleagues have made relevant literature off limits in the Ninth Circuit as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p571\">\n      <span class=\"num\">571</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ironically, Rule 404(b), a rule of inclusion, references at least three categories of other \"acts\" encompassing the inner workings of the mind: motive, intent, and knowledge. Once it has been established that the evidence offered serves one of these purposes, the relevant Advisory Committee notes make it clear that the \"only\" conditions justifying the exclusion of the evidence are those described in Rule 403: unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p572\">\n      <span class=\"num\">572</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note to Subdivision (b). The second sentence of Rule 404(b) as submitted to the Congress began with the words \"This subdivision does not exclude the evidence when offered\". The Committee amended this language to read \"It may, however, be admissible\", the words used in the 1971 Advisory Committee draft, on the ground that this formulation properly placed greater emphasis on admissibility than did the final Court version. House Report No. 93-650.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p573\">\n      <span class=\"num\">573</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Note to Subdivision (b). This rule provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove character but may be admissible for other specified purposes such as proof of motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p574\">\n      <span class=\"num\">574</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although your committee sees no necessity in amending the rule itself, it anticipates that the use of the discretionary word \"may\" with respect to the admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or acts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on the trial judge. Rather, it is anticipated that with respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of those considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e., prejudice, confusion or waste of time. Senate Report No. 93-1277.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p575\">\n      <span class=\"num\">575</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court embraced this understanding of Rule 404(b) and its handling of \"other acts\" in <i>Huddleston v.

The Advisory Committee specifically declined to offer any \"mechanical solution\" to the admission of evidence under 404(b). Rather, the Committee indicated that the trial court should assess such evidence under the usual rules for admissibility: \"The determination must be made whether the danger of undue prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence in view of the availability of other means of proof and other factors appropriate for making decisions of this kind under Rule 403.\" <i>[S]ee also,</i> S Rep No. 93-1277, p 25 (1974) (\"[I]t is anticipated that with respect to permissible uses for such evidence, the trial judge may exclude it only on the basis of those considerations set forth in Rule 403, i.e. prejudice, confusion or waste of time\"). Petitioner's suggestion that a preliminary finding is necessary to protect the defendant from the potential for unfair prejudice is also belied by the Reports of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House made clear that the version of Rule 404(b) which became law was intended to \"plac[e] greater emphasis on admissibility than did the final Court verison.\" The Senate echoed this theme: \"[T]he use of the discretionary word `may' with respect to the admissibility of evidence of crimes, wrongs, or other acts is not intended to confer any arbitrary discretion on the trial judge.\" Thus, Congress was not nearly so concerned with the potential prejudicial effect of Rule 404(b) evidence as it was with ensuring that restrictions would not be placed on the admission of such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p580\">\n      <span class=\"num\">580</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 688, 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112049\"><a href=\"/opinion/112049/huddleston-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1496</span></a></span> (internal citations omitted). Thus, the majority's exclusionary holding defies not only the clear purpose of the Rule itself, but the Supreme Court's authoritative guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p581\">\n      <span class=\"num\">581</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding is not only legally wrong, but it extinguishes the discretion of a district court to decide questions of relevancy, inappropriately converting our standard of review from one that examines for an abuse of discretion into one that looks at a relevancy decision de novo. Their holding is a twistification of the principle that an error of law necessarily renders abusive an exercise of discretion based on that error. Here, there was no error of law. The evidence was relevant, period; and, as we observed in <i>United States v. Hearst,</i> 563 F.2d at 1337, n. 3, \"relevance is the essential criterion.\" Curtin had this evidence on his person when he entered the casino expecting to find \"christy13.\" An officer testified that Curtin \"had a Palm device, a PDA, and he was looking at &#8212; at it. He was looking at the screen [for five minutes] and he kept on looking up as if he was trying to verify the time or location.\" Curtin conceded in his testimony that he personally had downloaded these stories through a computer to his PDA because he believed they were \"quite erotic.\" [Day 4, p. 23] The particular erotic story that attracted his attention was about a \"17 year-old girl,\" and he downloaded them to find more of the same. [Day 4, p. 56] He caused them to be put out on his PDA in December, 2003, just two and one-half months before contacting \"christy13.\" Curtin conceded \"skimming\" some of the downloaded stories.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p582\">\n      <span class=\"num\">582</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case in combination with <i>Shymanovitz</i> improperly hamstrings the capability of the rule of law to cope in this Circuit with adults who see children as sexual prey. Congress has enacted a law protecting minors from this behavior, but we have misinterpreted the Rules of Evidence to make the law inordinately difficult to enforce. Without justification, this holding handcuffs jurors when confronted with \"no intent\" defenses, turning such trials into the equivalent of \"he said, she said\" conundrums. My experience with jurors is that confronted with these situations, they want context, corroborating evidence, and other pertinent information which helps them sort out conflicting claims and assertions. Why? Not because it is prejudicial, but because it is relevant, whether it cuts for or against a defendant. As recognized by the Tenth Circuit in <i>Viefhaus</i> and <i>Magleby,</i> context and circumstances are important, and relevant literature can be used to this end &#8212; even if it is obscene. Now, we leave the jury high and dry without relevant evidence to look to in order to ensure the validity of their verdict. Such a handicap is legally wrong as well as unwise. At the very least, the district court's decision regarding the evidence eventually submitted to the jury was far from abusive. If somehow it is correct that <i>Shymanovitz</i> commands this result, then <i>Shymanovitz</i> is seriously defective and must be reconsidered. Thus, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This conversation was between Curtin, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Detective Castaneda, and FBI special agent Flaherty.

The majority opinion does not take issue with this analysis. Rather, the majority asserts that as a matter of law, reading material is categorically irrelevant and dissimilar for the purposes of Fed.R.Evid. 401 and 404(b).

From that statement the majority asserts that reading material can never be relevant to any crime. This over-generalization best illustrates the majority's failure to appreciate the fact that the \"offense described\" in <i>Shymanovitz</i> was <i>not</i> a specific intent crime.
