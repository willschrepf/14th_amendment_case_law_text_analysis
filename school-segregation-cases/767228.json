Atty. at the time the brief was filed, John A. Terry and David C. Woll, Asst. U. S. Attys., were on the brief for appellee.  Harold H. Titus, Jr., U. S. Atty., also entered an appearance for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marilyn Cohen and Robert M. Werdig, Jr., Washington, D. C., were on the brief as amicus curiae.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before BAZELON, Chief Judge, WILKEY, Circuit Judge, and MATTHEWS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> Senior District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WILKEY, Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On 13 November 1970 appellant was found guilty of robbery (22 D. C.Code Sec. 2901), simple assault (22 D.C. Code Sec. 502), and carrying a pistol without a license (22 D.C.Code Sec. 3204).  He was sentenced to 2-6 years for the robbery, 1 year for the assault, and 1 year for carrying the pistol, all sentences to run concurrently.  At the time of his conviction, McDonald was twenty-two years old.  The only contention meriting discussion on this appeal is his claim that the District Court improperly sentenced him as an adult offender.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that he was eligible for youth corrections treatment pursuant to the Young Adult Offender statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He claims that the District Court erred in either (1) failing to articulate reasons for deciding in favor of an adult sentence or (2) acting on the presumption that, where only D.C.Code offenses were charged, the Young Adult Offender statute did not apply to give a youth corrections option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's reasons for imposing an adult sentence do not emerge clearly from the transcript.  At times, the judge expressed a desire to insure that the defendant serve a minimum sentence in confinement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In other instances, the judge expressed his feeling that the defendant would benefit from sentencing under the Youth Corrections Act, which is inconsistent with a minimum period of incarceration.  There is some indication that the judge felt that defendant was ineligible for youth corrections treatment as a matter of law. Since the decision to sentence McDonald as an adult was proper regardless of which description of the District Court's actions and motives is accepted, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judge thought he had an option to sentence McDonald under the Young Adult Offenders statute, the fact remains that he declined to do so.  His failure to make specific findings or to articulate his reasons for this decision was not in error.  Under the broad discretion granted by the Young Adult Offender statute, a court which found that an offender would benefit from Youth Corrections Act treatment would still not be required so to sentence him.  Furthermore, no finding on potential benefit is required, because \"an offender older than 22 years but less than 26 years is, as a general proposition, to be treated as an adult.\"  United States v. Waters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on the other hand, the District Court concluded that the Young Adult Offenders statute did not apply because only D.C.Code violations were involved, this conclusion must be upheld as correct.  Section 6 of Public Law 85-752 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Sections 3 and 4 of this Act [the Young Adult Offenders statute] shall apply in the States of the United States, and in the District of Columbia so far as they relate to persons charged with or convicted of offenses under any law of the United States not applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.  [Emphasis added.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Young Adult Offenders statute applies solely to persons convicted of national crimes, and the defendant was charged with and convicted of purely D. C.Code offenses, this case comes squarely within that limiting statutory language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant and amicus curiae claim that Section 6 unconstitutionally discriminates against those found to have violated local D.C. law. This argument essentially rests on one of two propositions: (1) the Young Adult Offenders statute improperly selects out District of Columbia offenders for separate treatment; or (2) there is no justifiable reason for Congress not to extend the special benefit of the national statute to local offenders.  Neither contention is supported by logic or precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first claim, amicus places strong reliance on dicta in United States v. Thompson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  That case did involve the important question of the \"extent to which Congress can treat residents of the District of Columbia differently from residents of the 50 states . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The court there held that the more lenient federal Bail Reform Act covered a defendant charged under national federal criminal statutes and that the more stringent bail provision of the District of Columbia Court Reform Act had to be construed as applying only to local D.C. offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would agree with appellant that excluding the District of Columbia from the nationally applicable provisions of the Young Adult Offenders statute might be suspect.  But appellant's argument is completely confused: this has not been done; to the contrary, appellant is being treated exactly as he would be if he were a citizen of one of the 50 states.  Appellant here is not a local resident convicted of a national offense claiming a right to uniform application of the statute.  Rather, caught in a situation precisely the opposite of that in Thompson, McDonald is complaining that he has not been separated out for special treatment \"based only on the situs of the crime.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant overlooks the fact that the special mention of the District of Columbia in the Young Adult Offenders statute was required solely by the \"anomaly\" that certain \"laws of the United States\" are not national in character.  The \"special\" provision relating to \"any law of the United States\" . . . \"applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia\" does not create special treatment for D.C.Code offenders -it merely operates to place the District of Columbia in the same status as the other states.  Under the clear words of the statute, citizens of the District are in the same situation as all others: a person convicted of violating a local law cannot claim the benefit of the Young Adult Offenders statutes, while a person convicted of violating a federal law in any jurisdiction can claim its coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Thompson court noted, the passage of a national law \"implies a threshold decision to override regional differences in favor of a uniform standard that will govern the entire country.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Appellant's argument appears to rest on the proposition that the courts must insist on uniform application of national laws when this operates to provide more lenient treatment for offenders in D.C. -but that a statutory provision which mentions D. C. in order to bring it into conformity with the 50 states is invalidly discriminatory if the resulting uniformity operates to treat local offenders more harshly than would a desired special exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We find neither logic nor sound policy in that suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of appellant's constitutional argument concerns the statutory scheme's effect of distinguishing between two groups of offenders.  Those persons under 22 years of age violating local D. C. law have a chance of receiving federal Youth Corrections Act treatment; while those between their 22nd and 26th birthdays, violating local law, do not.  As amicus points out, Congress extended the Youth Corrections Act to local D.C.Code offenders.  His accompanying argument is that a similar extension is required in the case of the Young Adult Offenders statute.  That just does not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refusal to extend the Young Adult Offenders statute is a rational discrimination based on an age group, not one against D. C. offenders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  So the Thompson court's requirements regarding special treatment of the District of Columbia-\"the strictest possible review\" and a \"convincing\" justification-do not apply.  Further, the fact that Congress can enact special local legislation dealing with the District of Columbia does not mean that it must always do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Young Adult Offenders statute is a cautious extension of the Youth Corrections Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  It is the sort of reform which Congress is allowed to take \"one step at a time.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Congress has chosen a rational limit to the first step -applying the reform to national crimes and stopping short of applying it to the full range of common law street crimes, which are prosecuted by the Federal Government only in the District of Columbia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was nothing particularly novel about Congress' choice to give special \"youth\" treatment to offenders between the ages of 18 and 21, and then later to extend it to the District of Columbia.  Although there was practically no discussion of this point,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> extension of Youth Corrections Act treatment to local D. C. offenders in that age bracket was not at variance with the practice in some states.  In contrast, special youth treatment for those between the ages of 22 and 26 was indeed quite novel.  We think it was an eminently valid approach to treat the District of Columbia like any other state in this context by refusing to extend the experiment to common law street crimes of the type covered by state law or the D.C.Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, to hold Congress' action here unconstitutional would be tantamount to saying that Congress could not pass national legislation dealing only with the problems of national crimes without making that legislation applicable to local offenses committed in the District of Columbia.  The statute challenged here is definitely not an experiment \"with the rights of the voiceless residents of the District.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Rather, it constitutes a legislative judgment not to extend an experiment which concerns only those who commit federal offenses.  Congress was as free to draw that line as it was to deny the benefit of the experiment to those offenders who had passed their 26th birthday.  Acceptance of the contrary theory would nullify every enactment dealing with purely local D.C. offenses which is at variance with its national federal counterpart.  We decline the invitation to so hold; accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BAZELON, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree that McDonald's conviction must be affirmed.  I also agree that the trial judge's statements at the sentencing hearing were problematic.  But I cannot agree that the sentence was nonetheless properly imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority begins by asserting that the Young Adult Offender statute does not require that the sentencing judge state his reasons when he denies an eligible offender such a sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  I cannot agree.  Nor do I think that United States v. Waters,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> where the sole statute at issue was the Youth Corrections Act, can be taken as having settled the question in its dicta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, more to the point, I do not think that this case involves the requirement that reasons be stated any more than did Waters.  Under the majority's view of the present case, this issue is irrelevant, because they hold that McDonald was ineligible.  Under my view, the requirement of reasons is not in issue because the trial judge did state reasons for his action.  The problem in this case is that one of the stated reasons was the judge's belief that McDonald was ineligible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that this was error, and that the trial judge's reliance on this ground rendered the sentencing illegal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  I would therefore vacate the sentence imposed and remand for resentencing.  At that time the trial judge could properly weigh the value of a sentence under the Young Adult Offender statute against the value of the other sentences available, including the \"minimum\" he mentioned during the original sentencing hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* McDonald was twenty-one years old at the time of the robbery, but did not come to trial for eleven months.  Five weeks before the jury returned its verdict, he turned twenty-two and thus became ineligible for sentencing directly under the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U. S.C. Secs. 5005-26 (1970).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a>  Both at sentencing and on this appeal, however, McDonald has contended that he was eligible for consideration for such a sentence by virtue of the Young Adult Offender statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4209 (1970), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>In the case of a defendant who has attained his twenty-second birthday but has not attained his twenty-sixth birthday at the time of conviction, if . . . the court finds that there is [sic] reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act sentence may be imposed pursuant to the provisions of such act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge instead imposed an adult sentence of two to six years imprisonment at an adult facility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a>  Although the judge made no attempt to articulate his reasons systematically, they were drawn from him during the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the majority indicates, one of those reasons appears to have been his belief that McDonald was barred from a Young Adult Offender statute sentence by section 6 of Public Law 85-752.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>  That law prohibits such sentencing where the offender has been convicted of violating a law applicable \"exclusively to the District of Columbia.\"  McDonald's robbery conviction was based on a provision of the D.C.Code. Defense counsel argued that the robbery statute was nevertheless not a law applicable \"exclusively to the District of Columbia.\"  Without formally ruling on the matter, the trial judge made it quite clear that he rejected this argument, and he later invited counsel to submit legal authority, if any could be located.  Nothing was submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal the Government contends that there are two statutory grounds that prohibit a Young Adult Offender sentence.  The first is that McDonald's conviction for robbery brings him within the terms of an uncodified statute that denies Young Adult Offender status to individuals convicted of crimes for which a \"mandatory penalty\" is provided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a>  The second is that violators of laws of the United States \"applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia\" are precluded from consideration for a Young Adult Offender sentence by the statute discussed by McDonald's attorney at sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority considers only the latter, finds it applicable and valid, and affirms.  I would hold that the first is inapplicable and that the second is unconstitutional.  My reasons follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first alleged bar is section 7 of Public Law 85-752, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>This Act does not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government argues that McDonald's conviction for robbery is such an offense.  The robbery statute, 22 D.C.Code Sec. 2901 (Supp. V, 1972), provides a sentence of \"imprisonment for not less than two years nor more than fifteen years.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 7 was added on the floor of the House of Representatives by amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> and thus was not the subject of hearings or discussion in committee reports.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a>  The floor debates clearly indicate, however, that it was not intended to apply to McDonald's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When House Joint Resolution 424, which became Public Law 85-752, was reported in the House, it was immediately attacked.  The responsible committee had failed to consult with two federal agencies that objected to the Resolution: the Post Office Department and the Bureau of Narcotics of the Treasury Department.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a>  Their objections arose from the potential effect of the Young Adult Offender statute and the indeterminate sentencing statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a> on two particular criminal penalties: one provided by the federal mail robbery statute, and the other set forth in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7237(d) (1970), which stiffens the punishment to be imposed for violations of certain narcotics laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a>  The former provided that an armed or second offender \"shall be imprisoned twenty-five years.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The latter specified that, as to the covered offenses, \"the imposition or execution of sentence shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted and in the case of a violation of a law relating to narcotic drugs, [the parole provisions of the U.S.Code and the D.C. Code] shall not apply.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  Section 7, a prepared response to these criticisms, was offered and accepted at that time, and the Resolution was passed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the ineligibility for probation and parole of second or armed violators of the mail robbery statute has been called into question since section 7 was enacted,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> these events on the floor of the House clearly show that Congress intended to bar Young Adult Offender consideration only when the conviction was based on a statute that provided a mandatory minimum period of actual incarceration.  In those cases in which the sentencing judge is given discretion to grant probation, suspend sentence, or provide some other form of supervision and rehabilitation-as opposed to a \"mandatory penalty\"-section 7 does not apply.  This interpretation is, to me, compelling, for any other construction would lead to an irrational result.

Thompson,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> this court held that whenever Congress passes a statute of general applicability that purports to single out and discriminate against residents of the District of Columbia, this court must strictly and carefully scrutinize that legislation.

See Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); Washington v. Legrant, 394 U.

As between a state and the United States, of course, there is no guarantee of the equal protection of the laws.  Thus, the classification imposed by section 6 would not have to comply with the requirements of equal protection.  But the District of Columbia is not a state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that application of the Constitution to nullify section 6 would also \"nullify every enactment dealing with purely local D.C. offenses which is at variance with its national federal counterpart.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  On the contrary, I do not doubt that in exercising its power over the District of Columbia Congress may enact a separate body of legislation and apply it only within that jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>  Indeed, in enacting a separate body of law for the District Congress apparently also has the power to enact laws substantially identical to its national legislation, to provide differing penalties for their violation despite that identity, and to require that both sets of laws be enforced in the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  The question in this case, however, is whether Congress can go further and establish such distinctions arbitrarily or even for impermissible purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Constitution contains no provision specially immunizing from fifth amendment scrutiny discrimination against interests unique to the District of Columbia.  Nor have the courts imported such an immunity into the fundamental law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  Rather, the local power is merely one of a number of powers conferred on the Congress, and immunity from equal protection scrutiny by the judiciary must stand or fall on a general proposition: that Congress, by relying upon two constitutional grants of power rather than one, may discriminate free of the equal protection requirements of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a simple answer to this proposition.  Such a license to discriminate has never existed.  Nor is it needed.  The Government's purposes for enacting any particular statute are fully and adequately protected by the equal protection test.  When those purposes justify a discriminatory impact on the rights of a class of individuals, then that statute will be sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is every reason to disapprove such a claim of immunity.  The power of Congress has grown in proportion to our national needs, and today is so broad that many-if not most-laws could be justified under serveal of the powers granted by the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  If that overlap could immunize legislation from the requirements of due process and equal protection, an important part of the Fifth Amendment would, for all practical purposes, cease to exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the traditional and proper analysis, we look to the power that the Constitution confers on Congress; we do so only to determine (1) whether Congress could pass the law that is before us, and, if so, (2) for the furtherance of what purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  But when we apply the equal protection test, the interests of the Government in achieving the permissible purposes in question must be weighed against the impact on those whose interests are affected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Requirements of Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equal protection requirements of the Constitution cannot be expressed in a single standard, nor even in two.  It is quite true that only when legislation burdens fundamental interests or creates suspect classifications do we require that the Government support that law with compelling justifications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  But even in the absence of these special situations, the time has long passed when it could be flatly asserted that the Supreme Court will sustain legislative discriminations if \"some rational basis\" can be conceived for that action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  To determine the appropriate standard to apply to section 6, we must define the nature of the interests it burdens and the discrimination it establishes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section 6 of Public Law 85-752 has an adverse impact on those whom it excludes from eligibility for a sentence under the terms of the Youth Corrections Act is obvious.  The Youth Adult Offender statute provides that eligibility for such a sentence is contingent on a finding that the individual will \"benefit\" from the program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  The benefits provided by statute include a guarantee of \"treatment,\" which may include being sent to \"training schools, hospitals, farms, forestry and other camps.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  Those benefits include, as well, segregation from older and more hardened offenders whose presence would pose both a threat to the youth's rehabilitation and treatment and a grave source of physical danger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a>  Finally, and far from least important, those benefits include the possibility of having the original conviction set aside and re-entering the world with a clean record<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a>-a benefit recognized by the Supreme Court as important enough to warrant, without more, habeas corpus relief when a conviction is found erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither can it be doubted that the classification established by section 6 is problematic.  It is not based on the nature of the particular offense committed, but on the jurisdictional scope of the law defining that offense.  Further, the group it purports to exclude from eligibility for Youth Corrections Act sentencing is drawn exclusively from the District of Columbia, the residents of which, this court has pointed out, are entirely deprived of a voice in the Congress that enacts all local legislation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these effects of section 6, several decisional sources provide guidance in determining the nature of the justification that would be required to support that law. In United States v. Thompson<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> this court held that when a statute (1) infringes on the interests of an individual in securing his freedom on bail pending appeal from a criminal conviction, and (2) does so by separately classifying violators of a single criminal law on the basis of whether they were convicted in the District of Columbia or elsewhere, that statute can stand only if \"convincing\" reasons can be provided to support it.  Reasons that are \"merely rational or even plausible\" will not suffice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when the nature of the legislative classification and the interests infringed are less striking, however, the Supreme Court has determined that merely conceivable justifications will not be found adequate.  In Turner v. Fouche, 396 U.S. 346, 90 S.Ct. 532, 24 L.Ed.2d 567 (1970), for example, the Court struck down a law limiting eligibility for local appointive office to freeholders.  Without finding either that the law imposed a suspect classification or that it burdened fundamental rights, the Court refused to accept as a justification for the law anything less than a showing that a citizen \"must . . . own real property if he is to participate responsibly,\" or that lack of ownership would establish \"a lack of attachment to the community and its educational values.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a>  This is a far more stringent requirement that a showing that property ownership has some rational relationship to community attachment and responsible participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner provides a convenient point of reference for an examination of section 6. Certainly, the interests at stake in Turner-eligibility to hold appointive office-are no more important to an individual than the interests at stake in McDonald's situation-the opportunity to receive rehabilitative treatment, expungement of the criminal conviction, and segregation from the more hardened elements of society who inhabit the adult prisons.  Similarly, a classification that discriminiates against individuals in the voteless District of Columbia on the basis of the jurisdictional scope of a statute must be viewed with at least as much suspicion as a \"freeholder\" requirement in a State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How far beyond Turner, and similar opinions of the Supreme Court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a> we would have to go to take adequate account of the interests and classifications established by section 6, I need not determine.  Both the terms and the legislative history of section 6, of the Young Adult Offender statute, and of the Youth Corrections Act, demonstrate that Congress lacked the quantum of justification that Turner demanded for the imposition of the Georgia \"freeholder\" requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Legislative Scheme and Purposes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Young Adult Offender statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> does not establish an independent correctional program.  It merely extends the Youth Corrections Act to a limited number of individuals.  Accordingly we must examine the scope and purpose of that Act, which was enacted in 1950<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> because, as the Senate report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>By herding youth with maturity, the novice with the sophisticate, the impressionable with the hardened, and by subjecting youth offenders to the evil influences of criminal techniques, without the inhibitions that come from normal contacts and counteracting prophylaxis, many of our penal institutions actively spread the infection of crime and foster, rather than check, it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing its approach from the successful Borstal plan in England,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a> the Youth Correction Act provided new sentencing alternatives to the trial judge for committing the \"youth offender,\" defined as a \"person under the age of twenty-two years at the time of conviction.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  The essential elements of that alternative program included indeterminate commitment at age-segregated facilities for the purpose of treatment, a supervised period of conditional release of at least one year, and a final year of unsupervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a>  Upon completion of this program in less than the maximum period authorized by law, the youth offender was to have his conviction automatically set aside and receive a certificate to that effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As originally enacted, the Youth Corrections Act extended to \"the continental United States other than the District of Columbia and Alaska.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a>  The relevant committee reports,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> which do not discuss this limitation, set forth only one criterion for limiting the Act-age.  Indeed, the discussion of the age limitation seemed implicitly to reject the geographical limitation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>Most of the causes which contribute to antisocial conduct of youth offenders in the period between adolescence and maturity disappear when the youth reaches full maturity.  The problem is to provide a successful method and means for treatment of young men between the ages of 16 and 22 who stand convicted in our federal courts and are not fit subjects for supervised probation-a method and means that will effect rehabilitation and restore normality, rather than develop recidivists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some post hoc explanation for the geographical limitation did come in 1952, when Congress extended the Youth Corrections Act to the District of Columbia, subject to the District's financial ability to contract for those services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  The House report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>As stated by [Chief] Judge Laws [of the District Court for the District of Columbia] the former objections to include the District of Columbia under the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act may be summarized as follows: (1) a serious budgetary problem would arise; (2) the method of sentencing convicted persons in the District of Columbia is different from that used in other district courts; (3) the District of Columbia has a separate Parole Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a>  U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 1380.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pointing out that the 1952 amendment adequately solved objections (2) and (3), the report concluded that the remaining objection (1) was \"budgetary.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a>  Congress, of course, solved that by adopting the amendment and appropriating funds.  Alaska and Hawaii were brought within the Act as they became states<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> and, in 1967, the financial limitation on application of the Act to the District of Columbia was removed without further explanation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Originally enacted in 1958,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a> the Young Adult Offender statute conditionally extended the operation of the Youth Corrections Act to individuals who have reached their twenty-second birthdays but not their twenty-sixth birthdays.  Like the Youth Corrections Act, it excepted from coverage Alaska and the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a>  Like the Youth Corrections Act, it was amended to include Alaska and Hawaii as they became states.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a>  Unlike the Youth Corrections Act, however, the Youth Adult Offender statute has not been amended to cover D.C.Code offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The separate processes of enactment and amendment of these two statutes resulted in this anomalous scheme: any individual under the age of twenty-six who is convicted of violating a congressionally created crime is eligible for Youth Corrections Act sentencing unless that conviction came after his twenty-second birthday and was based on a law \"applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet when Congress set up the Youth Corrections system, and when it amended the provisions establishing eligibility for that program, Congress did not consider whether there were any relevant differences between national and local offenses, or between the kinds of individuals who had violated those laws.  In fact, although Congress did not discuss its reasons for limiting the Young Adult Offender statute, it did explicitly state that its sole reason in 1952 for not having earlier extended the Youth Corrections Act to the District of Columbia was the program's financial cost.  Even if cost could justify a less ambitious program, it could not justify arbitrarily excluding one group on the basis of a classification unrelated to the purposes of the program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, there is no justification for section 6's exclusionary language in the statutes and legislative history.  Nor has the United States Attorney offered any of his own.  He suggests, however, and a majority of the panel agrees, that the Young Adult Offender statute can be approved as an experiment in corrections.  Noting that in United States v. Thompson,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fn71_ref\">71</a> this court condemned experimentation that directly burdened the interests of District of Columbia residents, the majority attempts to stand this ruling on its head.  They assert that Congress in section 6 chose to experiment by providing all individuals except local District of Columbia offenders with the \"benefit\" of Youth Corrections Act sentences.  This is a play on words, for the discrimination runs against the local offender in either case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although legislative experiments are not always to be condemned, despite the obvious fact that they impose inequalities because of their limited coverage, there must be limits to the degree of inequality introduced and the arbitrariness with which individuals are included or excluded from the statute's coverage.  In view of the discrimination imposed here, and the importance of the alternative treatment provided by Youth Corrections Act sentencing, section 6 draws too crude an exclusionary line to warrant judicial approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the United States Attorney has provided no other arguments in support of the statute, the majority has focused on the most obvious.  It states that Congress might have reasonably found that individuals become less fit for Youth Corrections Act treatment as they age.  While I find no difficulty with that general proposition, I cannot conceive of reasons that would suggest that this phenomenon is uniquely a characteristic of those who violate the District of Columbia's laws.  Nor has any evidence of such a phenomenon been brought to our attention.  But, by extending Youth Corrections Act treatment to all violators until the age of twenty-two, and to violators of the national law until the age of twenty-six, Congress has clearly legislated out of existence any explanation other than that local law violators are unique in the speed with which they become incorrigible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn72\" id=\"fn72_ref\">72</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that this phenomenon might be true in a particular case, or even for a particular law, Congress has taken full account of the possibility in the Young Adult Offender statute itself, by requiring the sentencing judge to take account of the offender's \"delinquency or criminal experience, his social background, capabilities, mental and physical health, and such other factors as may be considered pertinent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fn73_ref\">73</a>  If, after considering all of these, the judge \"finds that there [are] reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, sentence may be imposed\" under that law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn74\" id=\"fn74_ref\">74</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To exclude individuals who would otherwise qualify for Youth Corrections Act treatment simply because they violated local rather than national law has no more basis in either facts, common sense, or morality, than the rejected argument in Turner v. Fouche<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn75\" id=\"fn75_ref\">75</a> that property ownership enhanced the likelihood that an individual would participate responsibly in the affairs of his community.  And the majority's analogy to the states is entirely inapposite, since there is no guarantee of equal protection between national offenders and local offenders in the states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the majority is approving section 6 on the ground that it needs no rational basis.  Where randomness is a virtue, this is entirely proper-as, for example, in cases of jury selection and Selective Service eligibility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn76\" id=\"fn76_ref\">76</a>  But this is not such a case.  This program has clearly defined objectives, and eligibility criteria must rationally correspond to those goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if arbitrary exclusion were proper where Youth Corrections Act sentencing is concerned, I would not permit exclusion of District of Columbia offenders unless some rationale appeared.  Even when arbitrariness is permissible, Congressional motivation must be free of unconstitutional taint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn77\" id=\"fn77_ref\">77</a>  And the impact of a particular law may in some cases be so clear and predictable that it requires inferences concerning legislative motivation.  See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed. 2d 110 (1960).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every enactment disadvantaging District of Columbia residents occurs against a unique, albeit unavoidable, background.  First, the population of the District is almost three-quarters Black,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn78\" id=\"fn78_ref\">78</a> and racial minorities compose approximately ninety-five percent of those arrested for major violations in the District.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn79\" id=\"fn79_ref\">79</a>  Congress must be aware of these facts, if not their impact on legislation.  Second, Congress is not accountable to the population of the District of Columbia.  Where electoral accountability is absent, normal presumptions of legislative regularity have a weaker claim.  See United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 58 S.

See Luck v. United States, 121 U.S.App.D.C. 151, 348 F.2d 763 (1965).  Since this ruling followed argument by counsel, the court did give on-the-record consideration to McDonald's attempt to show sufficient reason for withholding the past conviction from the jury.  The court's decision, implicitly finding that no sufficient showing was made, is buttressed by the fact that the case \"had narrowed to the credibility of . . . the accused and his accuser-and in those circumstances there was greater, not less, compelling reason for exploring all avenues which would shed light on which of the two witnesses was to be believed.\"  Gordon v.

He argues that 22 D.C. Code Sec. 3204 requires that the weapon be found \"on or about his person\"; whereas the searching officer found the pistol on the floorboard and between and behind the front bucket seats of the car in which appellant and his companion were riding-where \"you couldn't just reach around and get it.\"  Transcript, at p. 137.  This court has construed \"about\" to mean \"in such proximity to the person to be convenient of access and within reach.\"  See Brown v. United States, 58 U.S.App.D.C. 311, 312, 30 F.2d 474, 475 (1929).  The placement of this pistol made it even more accessible than the one under a hinged front seat, which could only be removed after leaving the car, in Wilson v. United States, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 135, 198 F.2d 299 (1952).  As in Wilson, we find that the evidence was clearly sufficient to justify submitting the issue to the jury.  See Crawford v.

District residents have just as great an interest in seeing that less-than-youthful perpetrators of crimes of violence, characteristically covered by local law, are removed from society for a definite term of years as do the citizens of the 50 states, in which the Young Adult Offenders statute only extends to federal crimes, precisely as in D.C.

News, pp. 1379 et seq</p>\n        <p>Congress failed to consider the potential impact on the policy of the Act of the differing sorts of offenses covered by the U.S. and D.C. Codes.  The federal offenses habitually engaged in by youthful offenders, and for which youth corrections treatment was considered most desirable, were Dyer Act violations, i. e., the theft of automobiles.  When the Youth Corrections Act was originally considered, Mr. James V. Bennett, Director of the United States Bureau of Prisons, testified that \"far and away the largest number of young offenders who would come to us under the bill are automobile theft cases.\"  Hearings on S. 2609 Before a Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 29 (1949).  In contrast, many of the crimes committed by young people in violation of a \"law of the United States applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia\" involve much more serious, violent or vicious conduct.  See 119 Cong. Rec. 4553 et seq.  (Daily ed. 14 Mar. 1973) (remarks of Senator Beall).</p>\n        <p>This extension of the Youth Corrections Act to local street crimes of violence potentially creates the precise effect which the Act was designed to avoid.  Young perpetrators of the sort of violent street crimes which do not fall within the federal jurisdiction in the fifty states are made eligible for confinement along with those whose \"federal offense\" consisted of a \"joy ride\"-making youth corrections facilities more crowded and rendering rehabilitation all that much more difficult.  Were Congress to focus on that fact, second thoughts about the expansion of the Youth Corrections Act to D.C.

Inclusion \"establish[es] prima facie the laws, general and permanent in their nature, relating to or in force in the District of Columbia . . ., except such laws as are of application in the District of Columbia by reason of being laws of the United States general and permanent in their nature.\" 1 U.S.C.

It explicitly pointed out that the petitioner did not argue that point.

See Majority Opinion at note 11</p>\n        <p>But their comment about the interests of local residents in the removal of offenders from society for \"a definite term of years\" is relevant to section 7, not section 6. And section 7 renders this argument irrelevant, for all such offenders are ineligible for Young Adult Offender status.</p>\n        <p>Moreover, the majority's sympathy for District residents is unnecessary since the choice is not whether to remove offenders from society, but whether to treat and rehabilitate them after they have been so removed.</p>\n        <p>Finally, the analogy is itself defective.  We do not know whether the local/national distinction in the states is either rationale or justifiable, for the Constitution provides no mechanism for challenging that discrimination.  There is such a mechanism in the District of Columbia, and it applies to discrimination between offenders with just as much force as it would to discrimination between residents.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn28\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28_ref\">28</a>\n        <p> In Thompson, the court observed:</p>\n        <p>One of the rights which the Constitution guarantees District residents, in common with all residents of the United States, is the right not to be arbitrarily singled out for special treatment not accorded to others similarly situated.</p>\n        <p>Id. 452 F.2d at 1338.

C.Code Sec. 2901), simple assault (22 D.C. Code Sec. 502), and carrying a pistol without a license (22 D.C.Code Sec. 3204).  He was sentenced to 2-6 years for the robbery, 1 year for the assault, and 1 year for carrying the pistol, all sentences to run concurrently.  At the time of his conviction, McDonald was twenty-two years old.  The only contention meriting discussion on this appeal is his claim that the District Court improperly sentenced him as an adult offender.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that he was eligible for youth corrections treatment pursuant to the Young Adult Offender statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  He claims that the District Court erred in either (1) failing to articulate reasons for deciding in favor of an adult sentence or (2) acting on the presumption that, where only D.C.Code offenses were charged, the Young Adult Offender statute did not apply to give a youth corrections option.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court's reasons for imposing an adult sentence do not emerge clearly from the transcript.  At times, the judge expressed a desire to insure that the defendant serve a minimum sentence in confinement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  In other instances, the judge expressed his feeling that the defendant would benefit from sentencing under the Youth Corrections Act, which is inconsistent with a minimum period of incarceration.  There is some indication that the judge felt that defendant was ineligible for youth corrections treatment as a matter of law. Since the decision to sentence McDonald as an adult was proper regardless of which description of the District Court's actions and motives is accepted, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judge thought he had an option to sentence McDonald under the Young Adult Offenders statute, the fact remains that he declined to do so.  His failure to make specific findings or to articulate his reasons for this decision was not in error.  Under the broad discretion granted by the Young Adult Offender statute, a court which found that an offender would benefit from Youth Corrections Act treatment would still not be required so to sentence him.  Furthermore, no finding on potential benefit is required, because \"an offender older than 22 years but less than 26 years is, as a general proposition, to be treated as an adult.\"  United States v. Waters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on the other hand, the District Court concluded that the Young Adult Offenders statute did not apply because only D.C.Code violations were involved, this conclusion must be upheld as correct.  Section 6 of Public Law 85-752 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Sections 3 and 4 of this Act [the Young Adult Offenders statute] shall apply in the States of the United States, and in the District of Columbia so far as they relate to persons charged with or convicted of offenses under any law of the United States not applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.  [Emphasis added.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the Young Adult Offenders statute applies solely to persons convicted of national crimes, and the defendant was charged with and convicted of purely D. C.Code offenses, this case comes squarely within that limiting statutory language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant and amicus curiae claim that Section 6 unconstitutionally discriminates against those found to have violated local D.C. law. This argument essentially rests on one of two propositions: (1) the Young Adult Offenders statute improperly selects out District of Columbia offenders for separate treatment; or (2) there is no justifiable reason for Congress not to extend the special benefit of the national statute to local offenders.  Neither contention is supported by logic or precedent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first claim, amicus places strong reliance on dicta in United States v. Thompson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  That case did involve the important question of the \"extent to which Congress can treat residents of the District of Columbia differently from residents of the 50 states . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The court there held that the more lenient federal Bail Reform Act covered a defendant charged under national federal criminal statutes and that the more stringent bail provision of the District of Columbia Court Reform Act had to be construed as applying only to local D.C. offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We would agree with appellant that excluding the District of Columbia from the nationally applicable provisions of the Young Adult Offenders statute might be suspect.  But appellant's argument is completely confused: this has not been done; to the contrary, appellant is being treated exactly as he would be if he were a citizen of one of the 50 states.  Appellant here is not a local resident convicted of a national offense claiming a right to uniform application of the statute.  Rather, caught in a situation precisely the opposite of that in Thompson, McDonald is complaining that he has not been separated out for special treatment \"based only on the situs of the crime.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant overlooks the fact that the special mention of the District of Columbia in the Young Adult Offenders statute was required solely by the \"anomaly\" that certain \"laws of the United States\" are not national in character.  The \"special\" provision relating to \"any law of the United States\" . . . \"applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia\" does not create special treatment for D.C.Code offenders -it merely operates to place the District of Columbia in the same status as the other states.  Under the clear words of the statute, citizens of the District are in the same situation as all others: a person convicted of violating a local law cannot claim the benefit of the Young Adult Offenders statutes, while a person convicted of violating a federal law in any jurisdiction can claim its coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Thompson court noted, the passage of a national law \"implies a threshold decision to override regional differences in favor of a uniform standard that will govern the entire country.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Appellant's argument appears to rest on the proposition that the courts must insist on uniform application of national laws when this operates to provide more lenient treatment for offenders in D.C. -but that a statutory provision which mentions D. C. in order to bring it into conformity with the 50 states is invalidly discriminatory if the resulting uniformity operates to treat local offenders more harshly than would a desired special exception.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  We find neither logic nor sound policy in that suggestion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of appellant's constitutional argument concerns the statutory scheme's effect of distinguishing between two groups of offenders.  Those persons under 22 years of age violating local D. C. law have a chance of receiving federal Youth Corrections Act treatment; while those between their 22nd and 26th birthdays, violating local law, do not.  As amicus points out, Congress extended the Youth Corrections Act to local D.C.Code offenders.  His accompanying argument is that a similar extension is required in the case of the Young Adult Offenders statute.  That just does not follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Refusal to extend the Young Adult Offenders statute is a rational discrimination based on an age group, not one against D. C. offenders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  So the Thompson court's requirements regarding special treatment of the District of Columbia-\"the strictest possible review\" and a \"convincing\" justification-do not apply.  Further, the fact that Congress can enact special local legislation dealing with the District of Columbia does not mean that it must always do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Young Adult Offenders statute is a cautious extension of the Youth Corrections Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  It is the sort of reform which Congress is allowed to take \"one step at a time.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Congress has chosen a rational limit to the first step -applying the reform to national crimes and stopping short of applying it to the full range of common law street crimes, which are prosecuted by the Federal Government only in the District of Columbia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was nothing particularly novel about Congress' choice to give special \"youth\" treatment to offenders between the ages of 18 and 21, and then later to extend it to the District of Columbia.  Although there was practically no discussion of this point,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> extension of Youth Corrections Act treatment to local D. C. offenders in that age bracket was not at variance with the practice in some states.  In contrast, special youth treatment for those between the ages of 22 and 26 was indeed quite novel.  We think it was an eminently valid approach to treat the District of Columbia like any other state in this context by refusing to extend the experiment to common law street crimes of the type covered by state law or the D.C.Code.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, to hold Congress' action here unconstitutional would be tantamount to saying that Congress could not pass national legislation dealing only with the problems of national crimes without making that legislation applicable to local offenses committed in the District of Columbia.  The statute challenged here is definitely not an experiment \"with the rights of the voiceless residents of the District.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  Rather, it constitutes a legislative judgment not to extend an experiment which concerns only those who commit federal offenses.  Congress was as free to draw that line as it was to deny the benefit of the experiment to those offenders who had passed their 26th birthday.  Acceptance of the contrary theory would nullify every enactment dealing with purely local D.C. offenses which is at variance with its national federal counterpart.  We decline the invitation to so hold; accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BAZELON, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree that McDonald's conviction must be affirmed.  I also agree that the trial judge's statements at the sentencing hearing were problematic.  But I cannot agree that the sentence was nonetheless properly imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority begins by asserting that the Young Adult Offender statute does not require that the sentencing judge state his reasons when he denies an eligible offender such a sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  I cannot agree.  Nor do I think that United States v. Waters,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> where the sole statute at issue was the Youth Corrections Act, can be taken as having settled the question in its dicta.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, more to the point, I do not think that this case involves the requirement that reasons be stated any more than did Waters.  Under the majority's view of the present case, this issue is irrelevant, because they hold that McDonald was ineligible.  Under my view, the requirement of reasons is not in issue because the trial judge did state reasons for his action.  The problem in this case is that one of the stated reasons was the judge's belief that McDonald was ineligible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that this was error, and that the trial judge's reliance on this ground rendered the sentencing illegal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  I would therefore vacate the sentence imposed and remand for resentencing.  At that time the trial judge could properly weigh the value of a sentence under the Young Adult Offender statute against the value of the other sentences available, including the \"minimum\" he mentioned during the original sentencing hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* McDonald was twenty-one years old at the time of the robbery, but did not come to trial for eleven months.  Five weeks before the jury returned its verdict, he turned twenty-two and thus became ineligible for sentencing directly under the Youth Corrections Act, 18 U. S.C. Secs. 5005-26 (1970).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a>  Both at sentencing and on this appeal, however, McDonald has contended that he was eligible for consideration for such a sentence by virtue of the Young Adult Offender statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 4209 (1970), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>In the case of a defendant who has attained his twenty-second birthday but has not attained his twenty-sixth birthday at the time of conviction, if . . . the court finds that there is [sic] reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act sentence may be imposed pursuant to the provisions of such act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge instead imposed an adult sentence of two to six years imprisonment at an adult facility.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a>  Although the judge made no attempt to articulate his reasons systematically, they were drawn from him during the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the majority indicates, one of those reasons appears to have been his belief that McDonald was barred from a Young Adult Offender statute sentence by section 6 of Public Law 85-752.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a>  That law prohibits such sentencing where the offender has been convicted of violating a law applicable \"exclusively to the District of Columbia.\"  McDonald's robbery conviction was based on a provision of the D.C.Code. Defense counsel argued that the robbery statute was nevertheless not a law applicable \"exclusively to the District of Columbia.\"  Without formally ruling on the matter, the trial judge made it quite clear that he rejected this argument, and he later invited counsel to submit legal authority, if any could be located.  Nothing was submitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this appeal the Government contends that there are two statutory grounds that prohibit a Young Adult Offender sentence.  The first is that McDonald's conviction for robbery brings him within the terms of an uncodified statute that denies Young Adult Offender status to individuals convicted of crimes for which a \"mandatory penalty\" is provided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a>  The second is that violators of laws of the United States \"applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia\" are precluded from consideration for a Young Adult Offender sentence by the statute discussed by McDonald's attorney at sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority considers only the latter, finds it applicable and valid, and affirms.  I would hold that the first is inapplicable and that the second is unconstitutional.  My reasons follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first alleged bar is section 7 of Public Law 85-752, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>This Act does not apply to any offense for which there is provided a mandatory penalty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government argues that McDonald's conviction for robbery is such an offense.  The robbery statute, 22 D.C.Code Sec. 2901 (Supp. V, 1972), provides a sentence of \"imprisonment for not less than two years nor more than fifteen years.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 7 was added on the floor of the House of Representatives by amendment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> and thus was not the subject of hearings or discussion in committee reports.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a>  The floor debates clearly indicate, however, that it was not intended to apply to McDonald's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When House Joint Resolution 424, which became Public Law 85-752, was reported in the House, it was immediately attacked.  The responsible committee had failed to consult with two federal agencies that objected to the Resolution: the Post Office Department and the Bureau of Narcotics of the Treasury Department.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a>  Their objections arose from the potential effect of the Young Adult Offender statute and the indeterminate sentencing statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a> on two particular criminal penalties: one provided by the federal mail robbery statute, and the other set forth in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7237(d) (1970), which stiffens the punishment to be imposed for violations of certain narcotics laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a>  The former provided that an armed or second offender \"shall be imprisoned twenty-five years.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  The latter specified that, as to the covered offenses, \"the imposition or execution of sentence shall not be suspended, probation shall not be granted and in the case of a violation of a law relating to narcotic drugs, [the parole provisions of the U.S.Code and the D.C.

In those cases in which the sentencing judge is given discretion to grant probation, suspend sentence, or provide some other form of supervision and rehabilitation-as opposed to a \"mandatory penalty\"-section 7 does not apply.

As between a state and the United States, of course, there is no guarantee of the equal protection of the laws.  Thus, the classification imposed by section 6 would not have to comply with the requirements of equal protection.  But the District of Columbia is not a state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also suggests that application of the Constitution to nullify section 6 would also \"nullify every enactment dealing with purely local D.C. offenses which is at variance with its national federal counterpart.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  On the contrary, I do not doubt that in exercising its power over the District of Columbia Congress may enact a separate body of legislation and apply it only within that jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a>  Indeed, in enacting a separate body of law for the District Congress apparently also has the power to enact laws substantially identical to its national legislation, to provide differing penalties for their violation despite that identity, and to require that both sets of laws be enforced in the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a>  The question in this case, however, is whether Congress can go further and establish such distinctions arbitrarily or even for impermissible purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Constitution contains no provision specially immunizing from fifth amendment scrutiny discrimination against interests unique to the District of Columbia.  Nor have the courts imported such an immunity into the fundamental law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a>  Rather, the local power is merely one of a number of powers conferred on the Congress, and immunity from equal protection scrutiny by the judiciary must stand or fall on a general proposition: that Congress, by relying upon two constitutional grants of power rather than one, may discriminate free of the equal protection requirements of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a simple answer to this proposition.  Such a license to discriminate has never existed.  Nor is it needed.  The Government's purposes for enacting any particular statute are fully and adequately protected by the equal protection test.  When those purposes justify a discriminatory impact on the rights of a class of individuals, then that statute will be sustained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there is every reason to disapprove such a claim of immunity.  The power of Congress has grown in proportion to our national needs, and today is so broad that many-if not most-laws could be justified under serveal of the powers granted by the Constitution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a>  If that overlap could immunize legislation from the requirements of due process and equal protection, an important part of the Fifth Amendment would, for all practical purposes, cease to exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the traditional and proper analysis, we look to the power that the Constitution confers on Congress; we do so only to determine (1) whether Congress could pass the law that is before us, and, if so, (2) for the furtherance of what purposes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a>  But when we apply the equal protection test, the interests of the Government in achieving the permissible purposes in question must be weighed against the impact on those whose interests are affected.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Requirements of Equal Protection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equal protection requirements of the Constitution cannot be expressed in a single standard, nor even in two.  It is quite true that only when legislation burdens fundamental interests or creates suspect classifications do we require that the Government support that law with compelling justifications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a>  But even in the absence of these special situations, the time has long passed when it could be flatly asserted that the Supreme Court will sustain legislative discriminations if \"some rational basis\" can be conceived for that action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  To determine the appropriate standard to apply to section 6, we must define the nature of the interests it burdens and the discrimination it establishes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That section 6 of Public Law 85-752 has an adverse impact on those whom it excludes from eligibility for a sentence under the terms of the Youth Corrections Act is obvious.  The Youth Adult Offender statute provides that eligibility for such a sentence is contingent on a finding that the individual will \"benefit\" from the program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a>  The benefits provided by statute include a guarantee of \"treatment,\" which may include being sent to \"training schools, hospitals, farms, forestry and other camps.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  Those benefits include, as well, segregation from older and more hardened offenders whose presence would pose both a threat to the youth's rehabilitation and treatment and a grave source of physical danger.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a>  Finally, and far from least important, those benefits include the possibility of having the original conviction set aside and re-entering the world with a clean record<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a>-a benefit recognized by the Supreme Court as important enough to warrant, without more, habeas corpus relief when a conviction is found erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither can it be doubted that the classification established by section 6 is problematic.  It is not based on the nature of the particular offense committed, but on the jurisdictional scope of the law defining that offense.  Further, the group it purports to exclude from eligibility for Youth Corrections Act sentencing is drawn exclusively from the District of Columbia, the residents of which, this court has pointed out, are entirely deprived of a voice in the Congress that enacts all local legislation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these effects of section 6, several decisional sources provide guidance in determining the nature of the justification that would be required to support that law. In United States v. Thompson<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> this court held that when a statute (1) infringes on the interests of an individual in securing his freedom on bail pending appeal from a criminal conviction, and (2) does so by separately classifying violators of a single criminal law on the basis of whether they were convicted in the District of Columbia or elsewhere, that statute can stand only if \"convincing\" reasons can be provided to support it.  Reasons that are \"merely rational or even plausible\" will not suffice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even when the nature of the legislative classification and the interests infringed are less striking, however, the Supreme Court has determined that merely conceivable justifications will not be found adequate.  In Turner v. Fouche, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108027\"><a href=\"/opinion/108027/turner-v-fouche/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108027\"><a href=\"/opinion/108027/turner-v-fouche/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span> (1970), for example, the Court struck down a law limiting eligibility for local appointive office to freeholders.  Without finding either that the law imposed a suspect classification or that it burdened fundamental rights, the Court refused to accept as a justification for the law anything less than a showing that a citizen \"must . . . own real property if he is to participate responsibly,\" or that lack of ownership would establish \"a lack of attachment to the community and its educational values.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a>  This is a far more stringent requirement that a showing that property ownership has some rational relationship to community attachment and responsible participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turner provides a convenient point of reference for an examination of section 6. Certainly, the interests at stake in Turner-eligibility to hold appointive office-are no more important to an individual than the interests at stake in McDonald's situation-the opportunity to receive rehabilitative treatment, expungement of the criminal conviction, and segregation from the more hardened elements of society who inhabit the adult prisons.  Similarly, a classification that discriminiates against individuals in the voteless District of Columbia on the basis of the jurisdictional scope of a statute must be viewed with at least as much suspicion as a \"freeholder\" requirement in a State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How far beyond Turner, and similar opinions of the Supreme Court,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a> we would have to go to take adequate account of the interests and classifications established by section 6, I need not determine.  Both the terms and the legislative history of section 6, of the Young Adult Offender statute, and of the Youth Corrections Act, demonstrate that Congress lacked the quantum of justification that Turner demanded for the imposition of the Georgia \"freeholder\" requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Legislative Scheme and Purposes</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Young Adult Offender statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a> does not establish an independent correctional program.  It merely extends the Youth Corrections Act to a limited number of individuals.  Accordingly we must examine the scope and purpose of that Act, which was enacted in 1950<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a> because, as the Senate report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p>By herding youth with maturity, the novice with the sophisticate, the impressionable with the hardened, and by subjecting youth offenders to the evil influences of criminal techniques, without the inhibitions that come from normal contacts and counteracting prophylaxis, many of our penal institutions actively spread the infection of crime and foster, rather than check, it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drawing its approach from the successful Borstal plan in England,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a> the Youth Correction Act provided new sentencing alternatives to the trial judge for committing the \"youth offender,\" defined as a \"person under the age of twenty-two years at the time of conviction.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  The essential elements of that alternative program included indeterminate commitment at age-segregated facilities for the purpose of treatment, a supervised period of conditional release of at least one year, and a final year of unsupervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a>  Upon completion of this program in less than the maximum period authorized by law, the youth offender was to have his conviction automatically set aside and receive a certificate to that effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As originally enacted, the Youth Corrections Act extended to \"the continental United States other than the District of Columbia and Alaska.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a>  The relevant committee reports,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> which do not discuss this limitation, set forth only one criterion for limiting the Act-age.  Indeed, the discussion of the age limitation seemed implicitly to reject the geographical limitation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p>Most of the causes which contribute to antisocial conduct of youth offenders in the period between adolescence and maturity disappear when the youth reaches full maturity.  The problem is to provide a successful method and means for treatment of young men between the ages of 16 and 22 who stand convicted in our federal courts and are not fit subjects for supervised probation-a method and means that will effect rehabilitation and restore normality, rather than develop recidivists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some post hoc explanation for the geographical limitation did come in 1952, when Congress extended the Youth Corrections Act to the District of Columbia, subject to the District's financial ability to contract for those services.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a>  The House report stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>As stated by [Chief] Judge Laws [of the District Court for the District of Columbia] the former objections to include the District of Columbia under the provisions of the Youth Corrections Act may be summarized as follows: (1) a serious budgetary problem would arise; (2) the method of sentencing convicted persons in the District of Columbia is different from that used in other district courts; (3) the District of Columbia has a separate Parole Board.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a>  U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News p. 1380.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After pointing out that the 1952 amendment adequately solved objections (2) and (3), the report concluded that the remaining objection (1) was \"budgetary.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a>  Congress, of course, solved that by adopting the amendment and appropriating funds.  Alaska and Hawaii were brought within the Act as they became states<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a> and, in 1967, the financial limitation on application of the Act to the District of Columbia was removed without further explanation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Originally enacted in 1958,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a> the Young Adult Offender statute conditionally extended the operation of the Youth Corrections Act to individuals who have reached their twenty-second birthdays but not their twenty-sixth birthdays.  Like the Youth Corrections Act, it excepted from coverage Alaska and the District of Columbia.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a>  Like the Youth Corrections Act, it was amended to include Alaska and Hawaii as they became states.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a>  Unlike the Youth Corrections Act, however, the Youth Adult Offender statute has not been amended to cover D.C.Code offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The separate processes of enactment and amendment of these two statutes resulted in this anomalous scheme: any individual under the age of twenty-six who is convicted of violating a congressionally created crime is eligible for Youth Corrections Act sentencing unless that conviction came after his twenty-second birthday and was based on a law \"applicable exclusively to the District of Columbia.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet when Congress set up the Youth Corrections system, and when it amended the provisions establishing eligibility for that program, Congress did not consider whether there were any relevant differences between national and local offenses, or between the kinds of individuals who had violated those laws.  In fact, although Congress did not discuss its reasons for limiting the Young Adult Offender statute, it did explicitly state that its sole reason in 1952 for not having earlier extended the Youth Corrections Act to the District of Columbia was the program's financial cost.  Even if cost could justify a less ambitious program, it could not justify arbitrarily excluding one group on the basis of a classification unrelated to the purposes of the program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, there is no justification for section 6's exclusionary language in the statutes and legislative history.  Nor has the United States Attorney offered any of his own.  He suggests, however, and a majority of the panel agrees, that the Young Adult Offender statute can be approved as an experiment in corrections.  Noting that in United States v. Thompson,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fn71_ref\">71</a> this court condemned experimentation that directly burdened the interests of District of Columbia residents, the majority attempts to stand this ruling on its head.  They assert that Congress in section 6 chose to experiment by providing all individuals except local District of Columbia offenders with the \"benefit\" of Youth Corrections Act sentences.  This is a play on words, for the discrimination runs against the local offender in either case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although legislative experiments are not always to be condemned, despite the obvious fact that they impose inequalities because of their limited coverage, there must be limits to the degree of inequality introduced and the arbitrariness with which individuals are included or excluded from the statute's coverage.  In view of the discrimination imposed here, and the importance of the alternative treatment provided by Youth Corrections Act sentencing, section 6 draws too crude an exclusionary line to warrant judicial approval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the United States Attorney has provided no other arguments in support of the statute, the majority has focused on the most obvious.  It states that Congress might have reasonably found that individuals become less fit for Youth Corrections Act treatment as they age.  While I find no difficulty with that general proposition, I cannot conceive of reasons that would suggest that this phenomenon is uniquely a characteristic of those who violate the District of Columbia's laws.  Nor has any evidence of such a phenomenon been brought to our attention.  But, by extending Youth Corrections Act treatment to all violators until the age of twenty-two, and to violators of the national law until the age of twenty-six, Congress has clearly legislated out of existence any explanation other than that local law violators are unique in the speed with which they become incorrigible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn72\" id=\"fn72_ref\">72</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent that this phenomenon might be true in a particular case, or even for a particular law, Congress has taken full account of the possibility in the Young Adult Offender statute itself, by requiring the sentencing judge to take account of the offender's \"delinquency or criminal experience, his social background, capabilities, mental and physical health, and such other factors as may be considered pertinent.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fn73_ref\">73</a>  If, after considering all of these, the judge \"finds that there [are] reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will benefit from the treatment provided under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, sentence may be imposed\" under that law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn74\" id=\"fn74_ref\">74</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To exclude individuals who would otherwise qualify for Youth Corrections Act treatment simply because they violated local rather than national law has no more basis in either facts, common sense, or morality, than the rejected argument in Turner v. Fouche<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn75\" id=\"fn75_ref\">75</a> that property ownership enhanced the likelihood that an individual would participate responsibly in the affairs of his community.

The federal offenses habitually engaged in by youthful offenders, and for which youth corrections treatment was considered most desirable, were Dyer Act violations, i. e., the theft of automobiles.  When the Youth Corrections Act was originally considered, Mr. James V.

We do not know whether the local/national distinction in the states is either rationale or justifiable, for the Constitution provides no mechanism for challenging that discrimination.

This is not to say that legislation is to be struck down because of the presence of impermissible motive.  Rather, as Professor Ely demonstrates, the presence of an impermissible motive may operate only to shift the burden to the Government to show that the law is rationally related to some permissible goal.  But where the statutory exclusion is random or arbitrary, merely shifting the burden will generally result in voiding the law, because the exclusion by definition lacks a rationale.
