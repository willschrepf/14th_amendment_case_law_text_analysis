For the following reasons, this request is DENIED.\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\n      Reginald Perkins was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death\nfor the December 4, 2000, strangulation death of his stepmother, Gertie Perkins.\nA full account of the underlying facts can be found in the district court’s opinion,\nPerkins v. Quarterman, No. 4:06-CV-687-A (N.D. Tex. Mar. 1, 2007). We have\nincluded the facts relevant to each of Perkins’s claims on appeal in our\ndiscussion below. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Perkins’s\nconviction and sentence on direct appeal, Perkins v. State, No. 74,318 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. June 30, 2004) (unpublished), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari,\nPerkins v. Texas, 543 U.S. 1164 (2005). Perkins also filed a state petition for\nhabeas corpus.     The state trial court held lengthy evidentiary hearings\n(generating six volumes of transcript and one volume of exhibits), adopted\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended that the petition be\ndenied. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial court’s findings\nand denied relief. Ex parte Perkins, No. WR-64,354-01 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 13,\n2006). Perkins next filed a federal habeas petition in the Northern District of\nTexas, alleging seven grounds for relief. The district court denied all relief, and\ndenied a certificate of appealability (COA) on all claims. Perkins now requests\na COA for an Atkins claim, two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, a\nconstitutional challenge to the Texas sentencing statute, and an actual\ninnocence claim.\n                         II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Perkins’s federal habeas petition was filed in 2006, so it is subject to the\nrequirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nSee Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 336 (1997). Under AEDPA, a petitioner\nmust obtain a COA in order to appeal the denial of his petition in district court.\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1). Because the district court denied Perkins’s application\nfor a COA, he now requests one from this court. See id.\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                   No. 07-70010\n\n      We may issue a COA only if a petitioner makes “a substantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right.” Id. § 2253(c)(2). “A petitioner satisfies this\nstandard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district\ncourt’s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the\nissues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.”\nMiller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 327 (2003) (citing Slack v. McDaniel, 529\nU.S. 473, 484 (2000)). The COA determination is a “threshold inquiry” that\nconsists of “an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general\nassessment of their merits,” but “does not require full consideration of the\nfactual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.” Id. at 336. “While the\nnature of a capital case is not of itself sufficient to warrant the issuance of a\nCOA, in a death penalty case any doubts as to whether a COA should issue must\nbe resolved in the petitioner’s favor.” Johnson v. Quarterman, 483 F.3d 278, 285\n(5th Cir. 2007) (citing Ramirez v. Dretke, 398 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir. 2005)).\n      We also recognize that the district court evaluated Perkins’s claims under\nAEDPA’s deferential framework. Under AEDPA, habeas relief may not be\ngranted on any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state\ncourt’s adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court,” or “resulted in a decision that was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d). In addition, “a determination of a factual issue made by [the] State\ncourt shall be presumed to be correct” unless rebutted by clear and convincing\nevidence. Id. § 2254(e)(1).\n                                III. DISCUSSION\n      Perkins now requests a COA on five issues: (1) whether his death sentence\nis barred by the Eighth Amendment because he is mentally retarded; (2)\nwhether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate\n\n                                         3\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nand present evidence that he is mentally retarded; (3) whether trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating\nevidence at the punishment phase of his trial; (4) whether the Texas sentencing\nscheme unconstitutionally places the burden of proof for mitigation on the\ncriminal defendant; and (5) whether his death sentence is unconstitutional\nbecause he is actually innocent. We address each issue in turn.\nA.    Mental Retardation\n      The state court found that Perkins is not mentally retarded. The district\ncourt concluded that this decision was not unreasonable, and that Perkins had\nfailed to controvert the state court’s finding with clear and convincing evidence.\nWe must now determine if reasonable jurists would disagree with this\nconclusion.\n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Atkins v. Virginia barred the execution\nof mentally retarded persons, but left “to the State[s] the task of developing\nappropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction.” 536 U.S. 304, 317\n(2002). Texas courts have responded to Atkins by requiring a person claiming\nto be mentally retarded to “show that he suffers from a disability characterized\nby (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, usually defined\nas an I.Q. of about 70 or below; (2) accompanied by related limitations in\nadaptive functioning; (3) the onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18.” In re\nSalazar, 443 F.3d 430, 432 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d\n1, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      With regard to the first element, three IQ tests were administered in\nconnection with the state court proceedings, with Perkins’s scores ranging from\n66 to 80. In September 2003, Perkins scored a 68 on the Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III). The state habeas court found this\nresult unreliable, though, because Perkins took the test immediately after\nundergoing an upsetting psychological evaluation. At the state evidentiary\n\n                                        4\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nhearings, the doctor who administered the evaluation and IQ test stated that,\nin hindsight, it would have been preferable to administer the IQ test first, when\nPerkins was “fresher” and not burdened with “emotionally loaded information.”\nThis doctor had initially believed Perkins to be mentally retarded, but testified\nthat he was “uncertain” and “no longer willing to state with a reasonable degree\nof psychological certainty” that Perkins is mentally retarded. In June 2004,\nPerkins took the WAIS-III again, without being interviewed beforehand, and\nscored an 80. The doctor who administered this test believed it represented\nPerkins’s true ability, and that the earlier score of 68 was probably due to\n“emotional interference.”\n      Nonetheless, in the face of the two conflicting scores on the WAIS-III, the\nstate court suggested that a third evaluation be performed, and in May 2005\nPerkins scored a 66 on a different IQ test, the Stanford-Binet V. However, in the\nsecond part of the state evidentiary hearing (which was postponed for fifteen\nmonths to allow for the third test), the doctor who administered this test stated\n“with a high degree of certainty” that the result was not valid because Perkins\ndid not give full effort. He compared Perkins’s results to the results of a group\n“who were asked to deliberately feign cognitive problems,” and concluded that\nPerkins satisfied the criteria for “probable malingering.”      The state court\ndiscounted the result from the Stanford-Binet test because of the lack of full\neffort and incentive to malinger on Perkins’s part. It found that the second test,\nin which Perkins scored an 80, was a reliable and accurate measure of Perkins’s\nIQ.\n      On the second element, Perkins’s doctor testified that it is difficult to\nmeasure adaptive functioning in a person, like Perkins, who has been\ninstitutionalized for a substantial period of time. However, anecdotal reports of\nPerkins’s family, an academic skills test, and Perkins’s self-reporting were said\nto show evidence of adaptive behavior deficits. The record from the state habeas\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nproceedings shows that Perkins had obtained a commercial driver’s licence, been\nemployed as a truck driver, completed numerous prison classes while previously\nincarcerated, and scored well in prison job and school evaluations. He had the\nability to read maps and follow directions, write checks, drive a nine-speed\nmanual transmission truck, calculate his pay based on a percentage of his\nemployer’s receipts, and play chess. The state also called attention to the\ncircumstances of the crime, which Perkins took steps to conceal by creating an\nalibi and attempting to cast the blame on another. From this evidence, the state\ncourt concluded that Perkins did not have adaptive behavior deficits linked to\ndeficits in intellectual functioning.\n      Finally, there was little evidence in support of the third element, onset\nbefore the age of 18. Perkins contends that it would be unrealistic to expect him\nto produce detailed records on this element because he was raised by a family of\nminimal education in rural Arkansas and attended segregated schools, but the\nstate court found no onset before the age of 18.\n      The district court determined that the state court’s finding that Perkins\nis not mentally retarded was not unreasonable and had not been controverted\nby clear and convincing evidence. Particularly in light of the state trial court’s\nlengthy habeas hearings and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, we\ndo not believe that reasonable jurists would find this decision debatable. The\ncrux of the matter is that not one of the three psychologists who evaluated\nPerkins was willing to definitively label him mentally retarded. We deny a COA\non this issue.\nB.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel — Mental Retardation\n      Perkins also claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance\nby failing to investigate or present evidence of his alleged mental retardation.\nThis claim is governed by the familiar standard of Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668 (1984). To prevail, Perkins must show that his counsel rendered\n\n                                        6\n\f                                   No. 07-70010\n\ndeficient performance, and that his defense was prejudiced by the deficiency. Id.\nat 687. The district court reasoned that even if trial counsel had been deficient,\nPerkins could not satisfy Strickland’s prejudice prong because he is not in fact\nmentally retarded. In light of the above discussion of Perkins’s Atkins claim, we\ndo not believe this conclusion is debatable. To the extent Perkins also argues\nthat evidence of limited intelligence, though not amounting to mental\nretardation, might still have been presented as a mitigating factor at sentencing,\nwe likewise believe debate on the district court’s decision to be foreclosed, for the\nreasons we discuss in our consideration of Perkins’s next claim.\nC.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel — Mitigating Evidence\n      Perkins next seeks a COA to appeal the district court’s denial of his claim\nthat trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate or\npresent mitigating evidence at sentencing. The district court agreed with the\nstate court’s conclusion that counsel’s performance was reasonable. The district\ncourt also concluded that Perkins could not show prejudice as required by\nStrickland.\n      At Perkins’s sentencing hearing, the prosecution first established that in\n1980, Perkins pled guilty to rape, attempted rape, and gross sexual imposition,\ncharges that arose out of sexual assaults on two twelve-year-old girls in Ohio.\nThe state also introduced evidence linking Perkins to the strangulation murders\nof two other women in Ohio. One of these women was the mother of one of the\ntwelve-year-old girls Perkins had raped. Perkins allegedly had warned this girl\nthat if she told anybody what had happened, he would kill whoever she told; her\nmother found out about the rape and was murdered shortly thereafter. The\nsecond woman was the pregnant twin sister of Perkins’s girlfriend. The state\nalso contrasted the kindness and affection shown to Perkins by his\nstepmother—she wrote him letters in prison, loaned him money, arranged for a\njob after he was paroled, and generally treated him like a son—with the\n\n                                         7\n\f                                      No. 07-70010\n\ncircumstances of the crime—he clubbed and strangled her in her own house,\nstashed her body in the trunk of her car, and then pawned her wedding ring.\n       The defense’s strategy at sentencing was to convince the jury that Perkins\nwould not be a future danger in prison.1 Through an expert witness, the defense\nshowed a videotape detailing the structured, ordered nature of Texas prisons,\nand argued that Perkins was a low risk for violence in such an environment.\nPerkins’s then-current jailor testified that he was not a disciplinary problem\nwhile in custody. A forensic psychologist, who had examined Perkins’s prior\nprison records as well as general statistical studies of prison violence, used\nactuarial methods to conclude that there was an 85 to 90 percent likelihood that\nPerkins would not commit an act of serious violence in prison.                     He also\nemphasized that Perkins’s age at the time of the trial (47) and relatively non-\nviolent prior prison record were factors that reduced the risk that he would\nengage in violent behavior. The defense also called fact witnesses in an attempt\nto cast doubt on the state’s evidence of Perkins’s extraneous offenses.\n       The state court found trial counsel’s decision to focus on the future\ndangerousness issue at sentencing to be a reasonable trial strategy.                      In\nevaluating decisions such as this one, the Supreme Court distinguishes between\n“strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to\nthe plausible options” and “strategic choices made after less than complete\ninvestigation”: the former “are virtually unchallengeable,” while the latter “are\nreasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments\nsupport the limitations on investigation.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690–91. The\nprimary focus, then, is “not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation\ncase,” but “whether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not to\n\n       1\n          Under Texas law, a defendant is eligible for the death penalty only if the jury\nunanimously finds that “there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.” TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. art.\n37.071, § 2(b).\n\n                                             8\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nintroduce mitigation evidence . . . was itself reasonable.” Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU.S. 510, 522–23 (2003) (emphasis in original).\n      The reasonableness of an investigation into a capital defendant’s\nbackground has been at issue in three recent Supreme Court cases. In Williams\nv. Taylor, the Court determined that trial counsel’s failure to present mitigating\nevidence could not be justified as a strategic choice, because counsel “did not\nfulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s\nbackground.” 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000). Counsel in that case failed to obtain\nrecords chronicling Williams’s “nightmarish childhood” because counsel\nincorrectly believed that state law barred access to the records. Id. at 395.\nCounsel also failed to seek prison records or obtain the testimony of prison\nofficials who described Williams as “least likely to act in a violent, dangerous or\nprovocative way.” Id. at 396.\n      In Wiggins v. Smith, the Court determined that trial counsel conducted an\nunreasonably limited investigation before deciding not to present a mitigation\ncase. 539 U.S. at 523–24. There, counsel consulted only two sources revealing\nanything about the defendant’s “life history”: a one-page pre-sentence\ninvestigation report prepared by the parole and probation office, and city social\nservices records. Id. Because of this limited investigation, counsel failed to\nuncover “evidence of severe physical and sexual abuse.” Id. at 516.\n      Finally, in Rompilla v. Beard, the Court held that even when the\ndefendant and his family members suggest no mitigating evidence is available,\nhis lawyer is bound to obtain and review material that counsel knows the\nprosecution plans to rely on at sentencing. 545 U.S. 374, 377 (2005). The Court\nfound prejudice in Rompilla’s case because a review of that material, a prior\nconviction file, “would have destroyed the benign conception of Rompilla’s\nupbringing and mental capacity . . . formed from talking with Rompilla himself\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nand some of his family members” and alerted counsel that further investigation\nwas necessary. Id. at 391.\n      With these precedents in mind, we make a “threshold inquiry” into\nPerkins’s claim that counsel’s investigation was inadequate. The record of the\nstate habeas proceedings (including the hearings, which thoroughly explored this\nclaim) shows that trial counsel began by asking Perkins to give an account of his\nlife, including information regarding his childhood and any abuse or other\ntraumatic experiences he suffered. In a written statement, Perkins recounted\nthat his mother whipped her children with extension cords, mop handles, broom\nsticks, a belt, or “whatever she got her hands on.” At age thirteen, Perkins\nmoved to Texas with his father, who also whipped him with a belt or extension\ncord in a similar manner. However, Perkins characterized these whippings as\na form of discipline, stating that, “I was young, and they only wanted me to\nmake something out of my life.”\n      In addition, the defense obtained copies of Perkins’s Ohio prison records,\nwhich, since Perkins had been incarcerated in Ohio for a large portion of his\nadult life, were extensive. These records included psychological and medical\nreports, prison education records, prison job evaluations, and Perkins’s own\nwritings. Where these records touched on Perkins’s background and family\nhistory, they largely confirmed what he had revealed in his written statement.\n      Trial counsel also employed a private investigator who traveled to\nCleveland and met with five members of Perkins’s family. The investigator\nlearned that Perkins’s mother was in the habit of using switches and extension\ncords to whip her children. However, the family members indicated that they\ndid not consider the mother abusive, but merely “very strict.” They called her\nthe “best of the best,” who “was always there for each of the kids.”         The\ninvestigator did not interview the mother, who by that time was in a nursing\nhome suffering from dementia. After the Cleveland meeting, the investigator\n\n                                       10\n\f                                       No. 07-70010\n\nkept in touch with the family by phone, and several family members traveled\nfrom Cleveland to Fort Worth for Perkins’s trial, where they periodically met\nwith trial counsel and the investigator.\n       After obtaining trial counsel’s file, receiving affidavits from counsel and\nPerkins’s family, and hearing testimony from counsel, the investigator, a\nmitigation specialist, and Perkins’s family at the evidentiary hearing, the state\nhabeas court concluded that counsel’s investigation was not deficient. Perkins\nargues that the investigation was nonetheless inadequate because it failed to\nuncover a large quantity of potentially mitigating evidence about his\nbackground, which was presented by the family for the first time in the state\nhabeas proceeding.2 However, the state court found that the affidavits and\ntestimony relating this evidence were not credible and were inconsistent with\nthe information originally given to the investigator.\n       In light of the investigation conducted, the state court found that counsel’s\ndecision to argue and present evidence on the lack of future dangerousness (as\ndistinguished from evidence about Perkins’s difficult childhood) was reasonable.\nCounsel knew that Perkins’s childhood was less than ideal, but did not believe\nthis fact would be particularly effective as a mitigating factor in light of\nPerkins’s prior criminal history and age at the time of the murder (45). The\ndistrict court essentially agreed with the state court’s conclusion that counsel’s\nperformance was reasonable, and we do not believe this decision is debatable.\nAccordingly, we need not consider the district court’s determination that Perkins\nfailed to demonstrate prejudice under Strickland’s second prong. We deny a\nCOA on this issue.\n\n       2\n         This evidence provided a much darker account of Perkins’s childhood; for example,\nPerkins’s sister stated that (1) Perkins’s mother tried to abort him with a coat hanger and by\ndrinking castor oil and bleach; (2) Perkins witnessed weekly, violent fights between his mother\nand her common-law husband, who both drank heavily; (3) Perkins’s mother prostituted\nherself to a neighbor so that Perkins and his brother could steal firewood from the neighbor;\nand (4) Perkins and his siblings were neglected and emotionally abused by their mother.\n\n                                              11\n\f                                    No. 07-70010\n\nD.       The Texas Sentencing Statute\n         Perkins next relies on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and\nRing v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), to argue that the Texas sentencing statute\nis unconstitutional because it does not place the burden on the State of proving\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficient\nto warrant the imposition of a life sentence rather than a death sentence. But\nas Perkins recognizes, this circuit has rejected the argument that Apprendi and\nRing require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of\nmitigating circumstances. See Granados v. Quarterman, 455 F.3d 529, 536–37\n(5th Cir. 2006); Rowell v. Dretke, 398 F.3d 370, 378 (5th Cir. 2005). The district\ncourt’s denial of this claim is therefore not debatable, and we deny a COA on this\nissue.\nE.       Actual Innocence\n         Finally, Perkins argues that he is actually innocent of the capital murder\nfor which he was convicted, and offers his own affidavit in support. He also\nspeculates that a jailhouse snitch who testified against him might have had his\ncharges reduced in exchange for testimony. The district court denied relief on\nthis claim.\n         Since Perkins has not asserted actual innocence as a “gateway” to obtain\nreview of an otherwise barred claim, see Dowthitt v. Johnson, 230 F.3d 733, 741\n(5th Cir. 2000), the only question is whether a stand-alone claim of actual\ninnocence is cognizable in a federal habeas petition. In Herrera v. Collins, the\nSupreme Court assumed, for the sake of argument, that “in a capital case a truly\npersuasive demonstration of ‘actual innocence’ made after trial would render the\nexecution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if\nthere were no state avenue open to process such a claim.” 506 U.S. 390, 417\n(1993). Whether such stand-alone claims of actual innocence claims are in fact\npossible is a question the Supreme Court has “decline[d] to resolve,” House v.\n\n                                         12\n\f                                 No. 07-70010\n\nBell, 126 S. Ct. 2064, 2087 (2006), but this circuit has not read Herrera as\nallowing such claims. See Foster v. Quarterman, 466 F.3d 359, 367–68 (5th Cir.\n2006); Dowthitt, 230 F.3d at 741–42. The district court’s denial of this claim is\ntherefore not debatable, and we deny a COA on this issue.\n                              IV. CONCLUSION\n      Perkins’s request for a COA is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f",

For the following reasons, this request is DENIED.\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\n      Reginald Perkins was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death\nfor the December 4, 2000, strangulation death of his stepmother, Gertie Perkins.\nA full account of the underlying facts can be found in the district court’s opinion,\nPerkins v. Quarterman, No. 4:06-CV-687-A (N.D. Tex. Mar. 1, 2007). We have\nincluded the facts relevant to each of Perkins’s claims on appeal in our\ndiscussion below. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Perkins’s\nconviction and sentence on direct appeal, Perkins v. State, No. 74,318 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. June 30, 2004) (unpublished), and the Supreme Court denied certiorari,\nPerkins v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142442\"><a href=\"/opinion/142442/perkins-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). Perkins also filed a state petition for\nhabeas corpus.     The state trial court held lengthy evidentiary hearings\n(generating six volumes of transcript and one volume of exhibits), adopted\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended that the petition be\ndenied. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the trial court’s findings\nand denied relief. Ex parte Perkins, No. WR-64,354-01 (Tex. Crim. App. Sept. 13,\n2006). Perkins next filed a federal habeas petition in the Northern District of\nTexas, alleging seven grounds for relief. The district court denied all relief, and\ndenied a certificate of appealability (COA) on all claims. Perkins now requests\na COA for an Atkins claim, two ineffective assistance of counsel claims, a\nconstitutional challenge to the Texas sentencing statute, and an actual\ninnocence claim.\n                         II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Perkins’s federal habeas petition was filed in 2006, so it is subject to the\nrequirements of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nSee Lindh v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118135\"><a href=\"/opinion/118135/lindh-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336 (1997). Under AEDPA, a petitioner\nmust obtain a COA in order to appeal the denial of his petition in district court.\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(1). Because the district court denied Perkins’s application\nfor a COA, he now requests one from this court. See id.\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                   No. 07-70010\n\n      We may issue a COA only if a petitioner makes “a substantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right.” Id. § 2253(c)(2). “A petitioner satisfies this\nstandard by demonstrating that jurists of reason could disagree with the district\ncourt’s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the\nissues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.”\nMiller-El v. Cockrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122258\"><a href=\"/opinion/122258/miller-el-v-cockrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327 (2003) (citing Slack v.

The COA determination is a “threshold inquiry” that\nconsists of “an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general\nassessment of their merits,” but “does not require full consideration of the\nfactual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.” Id. at 336. “While the\nnature of a capital case is not of itself sufficient to warrant the issuance of a\nCOA, in a death penalty case any doubts as to whether a COA should issue must\nbe resolved in the petitioner’s favor.” Johnson v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797464\"><a href=\"/opinion/797464/johnny-ray-johnson-v-nathaniel-quarterman-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 285\n(5th Cir. 2007) (citing Ramirez v.

Under AEDPA, habeas relief may not be\ngranted on any claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the state\ncourt’s adjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\nthe Supreme Court,” or “resulted in a decision that was based on an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d). In addition, “a determination of a factual issue made by [the] State\ncourt shall be presumed to be correct” unless rebutted by clear and convincing\nevidence. Id. § 2254(e)(1).\n                                III. DISCUSSION\n      Perkins now requests a COA on five issues: (1) whether his death sentence\nis barred by the Eighth Amendment because he is mentally retarded; (2)\nwhether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate\n\n                                         3\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nand present evidence that he is mentally retarded; (3) whether trial counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate and present mitigating\nevidence at the punishment phase of his trial; (4) whether the Texas sentencing\nscheme unconstitutionally places the burden of proof for mitigation on the\ncriminal defendant; and (5) whether his death sentence is unconstitutional\nbecause he is actually innocent. We address each issue in turn.\nA.    Mental Retardation\n      The state court found that Perkins is not mentally retarded. The district\ncourt concluded that this decision was not unreasonable, and that Perkins had\nfailed to controvert the state court’s finding with clear and convincing evidence.\nWe must now determine if reasonable jurists would disagree with this\nconclusion.\n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Atkins v. Virginia barred the execution\nof mentally retarded persons, but left “to the State[s] the task of developing\nappropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317\n(2002). Texas courts have responded to Atkins by requiring a person claiming\nto be mentally retarded to “show that he suffers from a disability characterized\nby (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, usually defined\nas an I.Q. of about 70 or below; (2) accompanied by related limitations in\nadaptive functioning; (3) the onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18.” In re\nSalazar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793885\"><a href=\"/opinion/793885/in-re-robert-madrid-salazar-movant/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 432 (5th Cir. 2006) (citing Ex parte Briseno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1592125\"><a href=\"/opinion/1592125/ex-parte-briseno/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n      With regard to the first element, three IQ tests were administered in\nconnection with the state court proceedings, with Perkins’s scores ranging from\n66 to 80. In September 2003, Perkins scored a 68 on the Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III). The state habeas court found this\nresult unreliable, though, because Perkins took the test immediately after\nundergoing an upsetting psychological evaluation. At the state evidentiary\n\n                                        4\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nhearings, the doctor who administered the evaluation and IQ test stated that,\nin hindsight, it would have been preferable to administer the IQ test first, when\nPerkins was “fresher” and not burdened with “emotionally loaded information.”\nThis doctor had initially believed Perkins to be mentally retarded, but testified\nthat he was “uncertain” and “no longer willing to state with a reasonable degree\nof psychological certainty” that Perkins is mentally retarded. In June 2004,\nPerkins took the WAIS-III again, without being interviewed beforehand, and\nscored an 80. The doctor who administered this test believed it represented\nPerkins’s true ability, and that the earlier score of 68 was probably due to\n“emotional interference.”\n      Nonetheless, in the face of the two conflicting scores on the WAIS-III, the\nstate court suggested that a third evaluation be performed, and in May 2005\nPerkins scored a 66 on a different IQ test, the Stanford-Binet V. However, in the\nsecond part of the state evidentiary hearing (which was postponed for fifteen\nmonths to allow for the third test), the doctor who administered this test stated\n“with a high degree of certainty” that the result was not valid because Perkins\ndid not give full effort. He compared Perkins’s results to the results of a group\n“who were asked to deliberately feign cognitive problems,” and concluded that\nPerkins satisfied the criteria for “probable malingering.”      The state court\ndiscounted the result from the Stanford-Binet test because of the lack of full\neffort and incentive to malinger on Perkins’s part. It found that the second test,\nin which Perkins scored an 80, was a reliable and accurate measure of Perkins’s\nIQ.\n      On the second element, Perkins’s doctor testified that it is difficult to\nmeasure adaptive functioning in a person, like Perkins, who has been\ninstitutionalized for a substantial period of time. However, anecdotal reports of\nPerkins’s family, an academic skills test, and Perkins’s self-reporting were said\nto show evidence of adaptive behavior deficits. The record from the state habeas\n\n\n                                        5\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nproceedings shows that Perkins had obtained a commercial driver’s licence, been\nemployed as a truck driver, completed numerous prison classes while previously\nincarcerated, and scored well in prison job and school evaluations. He had the\nability to read maps and follow directions, write checks, drive a nine-speed\nmanual transmission truck, calculate his pay based on a percentage of his\nemployer’s receipts, and play chess. The state also called attention to the\ncircumstances of the crime, which Perkins took steps to conceal by creating an\nalibi and attempting to cast the blame on another. From this evidence, the state\ncourt concluded that Perkins did not have adaptive behavior deficits linked to\ndeficits in intellectual functioning.\n      Finally, there was little evidence in support of the third element, onset\nbefore the age of 18. Perkins contends that it would be unrealistic to expect him\nto produce detailed records on this element because he was raised by a family of\nminimal education in rural Arkansas and attended segregated schools, but the\nstate court found no onset before the age of 18.\n      The district court determined that the state court’s finding that Perkins\nis not mentally retarded was not unreasonable and had not been controverted\nby clear and convincing evidence. Particularly in light of the state trial court’s\nlengthy habeas hearings and detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, we\ndo not believe that reasonable jurists would find this decision debatable. The\ncrux of the matter is that not one of the three psychologists who evaluated\nPerkins was willing to definitively label him mentally retarded. We deny a COA\non this issue.\nB.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel — Mental Retardation\n      Perkins also claims that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance\nby failing to investigate or present evidence of his alleged mental retardation.\nThis claim is governed by the familiar standard of Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). To prevail, Perkins must show that his counsel rendered\n\n                                        6\n\f                                   No. 07-70010\n\ndeficient performance, and that his defense was prejudiced by the deficiency. Id.\nat 687. The district court reasoned that even if trial counsel had been deficient,\nPerkins could not satisfy Strickland’s prejudice prong because he is not in fact\nmentally retarded. In light of the above discussion of Perkins’s Atkins claim, we\ndo not believe this conclusion is debatable. To the extent Perkins also argues\nthat evidence of limited intelligence, though not amounting to mental\nretardation, might still have been presented as a mitigating factor at sentencing,\nwe likewise believe debate on the district court’s decision to be foreclosed, for the\nreasons we discuss in our consideration of Perkins’s next claim.\nC.    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel — Mitigating Evidence\n      Perkins next seeks a COA to appeal the district court’s denial of his claim\nthat trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to investigate or\npresent mitigating evidence at sentencing. The district court agreed with the\nstate court’s conclusion that counsel’s performance was reasonable. The district\ncourt also concluded that Perkins could not show prejudice as required by\nStrickland.\n      At Perkins’s sentencing hearing, the prosecution first established that in\n1980, Perkins pled guilty to rape, attempted rape, and gross sexual imposition,\ncharges that arose out of sexual assaults on two twelve-year-old girls in Ohio.\nThe state also introduced evidence linking Perkins to the strangulation murders\nof two other women in Ohio. One of these women was the mother of one of the\ntwelve-year-old girls Perkins had raped. Perkins allegedly had warned this girl\nthat if she told anybody what had happened, he would kill whoever she told; her\nmother found out about the rape and was murdered shortly thereafter. The\nsecond woman was the pregnant twin sister of Perkins’s girlfriend. The state\nalso contrasted the kindness and affection shown to Perkins by his\nstepmother—she wrote him letters in prison, loaned him money, arranged for a\njob after he was paroled, and generally treated him like a son—with the\n\n                                         7\n\f                                      No. 07-70010\n\ncircumstances of the crime—he clubbed and strangled her in her own house,\nstashed her body in the trunk of her car, and then pawned her wedding ring.\n       The defense’s strategy at sentencing was to convince the jury that Perkins\nwould not be a future danger in prison.1 Through an expert witness, the defense\nshowed a videotape detailing the structured, ordered nature of Texas prisons,\nand argued that Perkins was a low risk for violence in such an environment.\nPerkins’s then-current jailor testified that he was not a disciplinary problem\nwhile in custody. A forensic psychologist, who had examined Perkins’s prior\nprison records as well as general statistical studies of prison violence, used\nactuarial methods to conclude that there was an 85 to 90 percent likelihood that\nPerkins would not commit an act of serious violence in prison.                     He also\nemphasized that Perkins’s age at the time of the trial (47) and relatively non-\nviolent prior prison record were factors that reduced the risk that he would\nengage in violent behavior. The defense also called fact witnesses in an attempt\nto cast doubt on the state’s evidence of Perkins’s extraneous offenses.\n       The state court found trial counsel’s decision to focus on the future\ndangerousness issue at sentencing to be a reasonable trial strategy.                      In\nevaluating decisions such as this one, the Supreme Court distinguishes between\n“strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to\nthe plausible options” and “strategic choices made after less than complete\ninvestigation”: the former “are virtually unchallengeable,” while the latter “are\nreasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments\nsupport the limitations on investigation.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690–91. The\nprimary focus, then, is “not whether counsel should have presented a mitigation\ncase,” but “whether the investigation supporting counsel’s decision not to\n\n       1\n          Under Texas law, a defendant is eligible for the death penalty only if the jury\nunanimously finds that “there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.” TEX.

PROC. art.\n37.071, § 2(b).\n\n                                             8\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nintroduce mitigation evidence . . . was itself reasonable.” Wiggins v.

In Williams\nv. Taylor, the Court determined that trial counsel’s failure to present mitigating\nevidence could not be justified as a strategic choice, because counsel “did not\nfulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant’s\nbackground.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (2000). Counsel in that case failed to obtain\nrecords chronicling Williams’s “nightmarish childhood” because counsel\nincorrectly believed that state law barred access to the records. Id. at 395.\nCounsel also failed to seek prison records or obtain the testimony of prison\nofficials who described Williams as “least likely to act in a violent, dangerous or\nprovocative way.” Id. at 396.\n      In Wiggins v. Smith, the Court determined that trial counsel conducted an\nunreasonably limited investigation before deciding not to present a mitigation\ncase. 539 U.S. at 523–24. There, counsel consulted only two sources revealing\nanything about the defendant’s “life history”: a one-page pre-sentence\ninvestigation report prepared by the parole and probation office, and city social\nservices records. Id. Because of this limited investigation, counsel failed to\nuncover “evidence of severe physical and sexual abuse.” Id. at 516.\n      Finally, in Rompilla v. Beard, the Court held that even when the\ndefendant and his family members suggest no mitigating evidence is available,\nhis lawyer is bound to obtain and review material that counsel knows the\nprosecution plans to rely on at sentencing. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799980\"><a href=\"/opinion/799980/rompilla-v-beard/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377 (2005). The Court\nfound prejudice in Rompilla’s case because a review of that material, a prior\nconviction file, “would have destroyed the benign conception of Rompilla’s\nupbringing and mental capacity . . . formed from talking with Rompilla himself\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f                                  No. 07-70010\n\nand some of his family members” and alerted counsel that further investigation\nwas necessary. Id. at 391.\n      With these precedents in mind, we make a “threshold inquiry” into\nPerkins’s claim that counsel’s investigation was inadequate. The record of the\nstate habeas proceedings (including the hearings, which thoroughly explored this\nclaim) shows that trial counsel began by asking Perkins to give an account of his\nlife, including information regarding his childhood and any abuse or other\ntraumatic experiences he suffered. In a written statement, Perkins recounted\nthat his mother whipped her children with extension cords, mop handles, broom\nsticks, a belt, or “whatever she got her hands on.” At age thirteen, Perkins\nmoved to Texas with his father, who also whipped him with a belt or extension\ncord in a similar manner. However, Perkins characterized these whippings as\na form of discipline, stating that, “I was young, and they only wanted me to\nmake something out of my life.”\n      In addition, the defense obtained copies of Perkins’s Ohio prison records,\nwhich, since Perkins had been incarcerated in Ohio for a large portion of his\nadult life, were extensive. These records included psychological and medical\nreports, prison education records, prison job evaluations, and Perkins’s own\nwritings. Where these records touched on Perkins’s background and family\nhistory, they largely confirmed what he had revealed in his written statement.\n      Trial counsel also employed a private investigator who traveled to\nCleveland and met with five members of Perkins’s family. The investigator\nlearned that Perkins’s mother was in the habit of using switches and extension\ncords to whip her children. However, the family members indicated that they\ndid not consider the mother abusive, but merely “very strict.” They called her\nthe “best of the best,” who “was always there for each of the kids.”         The\ninvestigator did not interview the mother, who by that time was in a nursing\nhome suffering from dementia. After the Cleveland meeting, the investigator\n\n                                       10\n\f                                       No. 07-70010\n\nkept in touch with the family by phone, and several family members traveled\nfrom Cleveland to Fort Worth for Perkins’s trial, where they periodically met\nwith trial counsel and the investigator.\n       After obtaining trial counsel’s file, receiving affidavits from counsel and\nPerkins’s family, and hearing testimony from counsel, the investigator, a\nmitigation specialist, and Perkins’s family at the evidentiary hearing, the state\nhabeas court concluded that counsel’s investigation was not deficient. Perkins\nargues that the investigation was nonetheless inadequate because it failed to\nuncover a large quantity of potentially mitigating evidence about his\nbackground, which was presented by the family for the first time in the state\nhabeas proceeding.2 However, the state court found that the affidavits and\ntestimony relating this evidence were not credible and were inconsistent with\nthe information originally given to the investigator.\n       In light of the investigation conducted, the state court found that counsel’s\ndecision to argue and present evidence on the lack of future dangerousness (as\ndistinguished from evidence about Perkins’s difficult childhood) was reasonable.\nCounsel knew that Perkins’s childhood was less than ideal, but did not believe\nthis fact would be particularly effective as a mitigating factor in light of\nPerkins’s prior criminal history and age at the time of the murder (45). The\ndistrict court essentially agreed with the state court’s conclusion that counsel’s\nperformance was reasonable, and we do not believe this decision is debatable.\nAccordingly, we need not consider the district court’s determination that Perkins\nfailed to demonstrate prejudice under Strickland’s second prong. We deny a\nCOA on this issue.\n\n       2\n         This evidence provided a much darker account of Perkins’s childhood; for example,\nPerkins’s sister stated that (1) Perkins’s mother tried to abort him with a coat hanger and by\ndrinking castor oil and bleach; (2) Perkins witnessed weekly, violent fights between his mother\nand her common-law husband, who both drank heavily; (3) Perkins’s mother prostituted\nherself to a neighbor so that Perkins and his brother could steal firewood from the neighbor;\nand (4) Perkins and his siblings were neglected and emotionally abused by their mother.\n\n                                              11\n\f                                    No. 07-70010\n\nD.       The Texas Sentencing Statute\n         Perkins next relies on Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and\nRing v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121165\"><a href=\"/opinion/121165/ring-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), to argue that the Texas sentencing statute\nis unconstitutional because it does not place the burden on the State of proving\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that there are no mitigating circumstances sufficient\nto warrant the imposition of a life sentence rather than a death sentence. But\nas Perkins recognizes, this circuit has rejected the argument that Apprendi and\nRing require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of\nmitigating circumstances. See Granados v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"43323\"><a href=\"/opinion/43323/granados-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536–37\n(5th Cir. 2006); Rowell v. Dretke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"37619\"><a href=\"/opinion/37619/rowell-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (5th Cir. 2005). The district\ncourt’s denial of this claim is therefore not debatable, and we deny a COA on this\nissue.\nE.       Actual Innocence\n         Finally, Perkins argues that he is actually innocent of the capital murder\nfor which he was convicted, and offers his own affidavit in support. He also\nspeculates that a jailhouse snitch who testified against him might have had his\ncharges reduced in exchange for testimony. The district court denied relief on\nthis claim.\n         Since Perkins has not asserted actual innocence as a “gateway” to obtain\nreview of an otherwise barred claim, see Dowthitt v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770899\"><a href=\"/opinion/770899/dennis-thurl-dowthitt-v-gary-l-johnson-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741\n(5th Cir. 2000), the only question is whether a stand-alone claim of actual\ninnocence is cognizable in a federal habeas petition. In Herrera v. Collins, the\nSupreme Court assumed, for the sake of argument, that “in a capital case a truly\npersuasive demonstration of ‘actual innocence’ made after trial would render the\nexecution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federal habeas relief if\nthere were no state avenue open to process such a claim.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112808\"><a href=\"/opinion/112808/herrera-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 417\n(1993). Whether such stand-alone claims of actual innocence claims are in fact\npossible is a question the Supreme Court has “decline[d] to resolve,” House v.\n\n                                         12\n\f                                 No. 07-70010\n\nBell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145648\"><a href=\"/opinion/145648/house-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2064</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2087 (2006), but this circuit has not read Herrera as\nallowing such claims. See Foster v. Quarterman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367–68 (5th Cir.\n2006); Dowthitt, 230 F.3d at 741–42. The district court’s denial of this claim is\ntherefore not debatable, and we deny a COA on this issue.\n                              IV. CONCLUSION\n      Perkins’s request for a COA is DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       13\n\f</pre>",
