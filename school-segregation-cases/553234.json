Wipf (collectively Colony). The\n\nDistrict Court determined that the requirement to provide workers’ compensation coverage\n\nfor the Colony’s members engaged in certain commercial activities contained in House Bill\n\n119 (2009 Mont. Laws, ch. 112 § 30) (HB 119) violated the Colony’s rights under the Free\n\nExercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S\n\nConstitution, and also violated the Colony’s right to equal protection of the laws under the\n\nU.S. Constitution and the Montana Constitution. We reverse.\n\n¶2     We address the following issues on appeal:\n\n¶3     1. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the definition of\n\n“employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under the Workers’\n\nCompensation Act violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n¶4     2. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the definition of\n\n“employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under the Workers’\n\nCompensation Act violate the Establishment Clause.\n\n¶5     3. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the definition of\n\n“employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under the Workers’\n\nCompensation Act violate the Colony’s right to equal protection of the laws.\n\n\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n                                             2\n\f¶6     The Hutterite Brethren Church originally formed in the 16th century as part of the\n\nAnabaptist movement during the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Anabaptists rejected\n\ninfant baptism as “unbiblical” and instead renewed the practice of adult baptism.\n\nAnabaptists live a life of pacifism. Jacob Hutter and his followers eventually broke away\n\nfrom other Anabaptists over a dispute regarding communal living.\n\n¶7     Jacob Hutter suffered a violent end as he was burned at the stake in a public square in\n\nInnsbruck, Austria, in 1536. Austro-Hungarian authorities held Hutter in freezing water and\n\nthen placed him in a hot room. Authorities further tortured Hutter by pouring brandy on his\n\nwounds before burning him to death.\n\n¶8     Hutterite believers moved across Europe for the next several centuries in search of a\n\nsafe place in which to practice their faith and live their communal life. This wandering\n\neventually brought the Hutterites to North America in the 19th century in search of religious\n\nfreedom. Hutterites continue to practice their faith and live a communal lifestyle in colonies\n\nin Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, and parts of Canada.\n\n¶9     The Colony, a signatory to the Hutterian Brethren Church Constitution, organizes\n\nitself as a religious corporation under Montana law. The Colony’s Articles of Incorporation\n\nprovide that it was formed for the purpose of operating “a Hutterische Church Brotherhood\n\nCommunity.” All members of the Colony must belong to the Hutterische Church Society\n\nand all members agree to “live a communal life and follow the teaching and tenets of the\n\nHutterische Church Society.” Daniel Wipf serves as the Colony’s first minister and\n\ncorporate president.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f¶10    The Department initially determined that the Workers’ Compensation Act did not\n\napply to the Colony or its members due to the fact that the Colony did not pay “wages” to its\n\nmembers. The Department based this determination on the fact that the Colony did not fall\n\nwithin the definition of “employer” set forth at § 39-71-117, MCA, and that the Colony’s\n\nmembers did not fall within the definition of “employee” set forth at § 39-71-118, MCA.\n\nThe 2009 Montana legislature enacted HB 119.\n\n¶11    HB 119 worked a laundry list of changes to the Workers’ Compensation Act,\n\nincluding revised claims handling practices (§ 39-71-107, MCA), and revised accident\n\nreporting requirements for employers (§ 39-71-307, MCA). Pertinent to our analysis,\n\nSection 6 amended the definition of “employer” to include:\n\n       a religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust receiving\n       remuneration from nonmembers for agricultural production, manufacturing, or\n       a construction project conducted by its members on or off the property of the\n       religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust.\n\n\nSection 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. Section 7 of HB 119 amended the definition of “employee”\n\nto include:\n\n       a member of a religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust\n       while performing services for the religious corporation, religious organization,\n       or religious trust, as described in 39-71-117(1)(d).\n\nSection 39-71-118(1)(i), MCA.\n\n¶12    The Colony brought an action against the Department in 2010. The Colony alleged\n\nthat Sections 6 and 7 of HB 119 impermissibly swept the Colony and its members within the\n\ndefinition of “employer” and “employee” in the Workers’ Compensation Act. The Colony\n\nand the Department agreed that the inclusion of the Colony within the definition of\n                                              4\n\f“employer” and the Colony’s members within the definition of “employee” would require\n\nthe Colony to provide workers’ compensation coverage for its members engaged in\n\ncommercial activities. The Colony alleged that this requirement to provide workers’\n\ncompensation coverage violated the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the\n\nColony’s right to equal protection of the law.\n\n¶13    The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court first\n\naddressed the Colony’s Free Exercise claim. The court determined that Sections 6 and 7\n\nwere not neutral as the burdens posed “fall only on the Hutterite religion.” The court further\n\ndetermined that Sections 6 and 7 were not generally applicable as the bill “unquestionably\n\ntargets only the Hutterite religious practice of communal living.” The two determinations\n\nprompted the court to apply strict scrutiny. The court’s strict scrutiny analysis led it to reject\n\nthe Department’s claim of any compelling state interest being served by Sections 6 and 7.\n\n¶14    With respect to the Colony’s Establishment Clause claim, the court purported to apply\n\nthe test from Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S. Ct. 2105 (1971). Sections 6 and 7\n\nfoundered on every factor of the Lemon Test. The court concluded that Sections 6 and 7\n\nimpermissibly “targeted a group defined by their religion.” The primary effect of this\n\nimpermissible targeting, in turn, “would be to inhibit the Colony in the practice of their\n\nreligion.” Finally, the court concluded that excessive entanglement with the State would\n\nensue as it “appears evident that a comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state\n\nsurveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that only particular areas of Hutterite\n\nactivities are scrutinized.”\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f¶15    The court also determined that Sections 6 and 7 violated the Colony’s right to equal\n\nprotection of the laws. These provisions, according to the court, specifically identify\n\n“religious organizations” and target a particular religious organization. The separate\n\nclassification created by Sections 6 and 7 “treats Hutterites differently from other religious\n\norganizations and further targets religious organizations generally.” This classification,\n\naccording to the District Court, failed to satisfy even the rational basis standard that applies\n\nto constitutional challenges to workers’ compensation laws. The Department appeals.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶16    This Court exercises plenary review of constitutional issues. DeVoe v. City of\n\nMissoula, 2012 MT 72, ¶ 12, 364 Mont. 375, 274 P.2d 752. We review for correctness a\n\ndistrict court’s decisions on constitutional issues. DeVoe, ¶ 12.

DeVoe, ¶ 12.\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n¶17    Issue 1. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the\n\ndefinition of “employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under\n\nthe Workers’ Compensation Act violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n¶18    The District Court determined that the practice of the Hutterite faith demands that its\n\nmembers engage in commercial activities with nonmembers for remuneration. This\n\ndetermination prompted the District Court to analyze the statute based on the strict scrutiny\n\nstandard applied in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye,\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fInc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993). The Court in Lukumi Babalu\n\nstruck down a group of municipal ordinances that banned animal sacrifice.\n\n¶19     The Santeria church intended to construct a church in the City of Hialeah. Animal\n\nsacrifice represents one of the principal forms of devotion of the Santeria church. Church\n\nmembers perform animal sacrifices “at birth, marriage, and death rites, for the cure of the\n\nsick, for the initiation of new members and priests, and during annual celebrations.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 524, 113 S. Ct. at 2222. The City of Hialeah enacted four ordinances\n\nimmediately after the Santeria church announced its plans to construct a church there.\n\n¶20     The Court recognized that the ordinances, though seemingly neutral on their faces,\n\neffectively served to ban animal sacrifices undertaken for religious reasons. The Court\n\nlikened the religious discrimination effect of the ordinances to an impermissible state law\n\nthat disqualified members of the clergy from holding certain public offices in McDaniel v.\n\nPaty, 435 U.S. 618, 98 S. Ct. 1322 (1978). Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at\n\n2226.    The Court similarly considered the effect of the ordinances in light of the\n\nunconstitutional application of a municipal ordinance in Fowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S.\n\n67, 73 S. Ct. 526 (1953). Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226. There the city\n\nhad interpreted a municipal ordinance to prohibit preaching in a public park by a Jehovah’s\n\nWitness, but to allow preaching during the course of a Catholic Mass or a Protestant church\n\nservice. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226, citing Fowler, 345 U.S. at 69-\n\n70, 73 S. Ct. at 527. The Court in Lukumi Babalu concluded that the religious exercise of the\n\nSanteria church represented “the only conduct” subject to the prohibition on animal sacrifice.\n\nLukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 535, 113 S. Ct. at 2228.\n                                              7\n\f¶21    The requirement that a religious corporation provide workers’ compensation coverage\n\nfor its members differs markedly from the outright ban of an activity central to the Santeria\n\nfaith. Unlike the prohibitions in Lukumi Babalu and McDaniel, the workers’ compensation\n\nrequirement does not prohibit the Colony members from engaging in the commercial\n\nactivity. HB 119 regulates the Colony’s engagement in commercial activities in the same\n\nmanner that the workers’ compensation system regulates the commercial activities of other\n\nemployers in Montana. The Colony, like all other employers in Montana, simply will make\n\nless money on these commercial endeavors once it pays the workers’ compensation\n\npremiums. And unlike the ordinance in Fowler, the workers’ compensation requirement\n\ndoes not place the Colony members in a discriminatory position compared to other religious\n\ngroups who might choose to engage in similar activity. These distinctions lead us to reject\n\nthe strict scrutiny analysis from Lukumi Babalu as the appropriate lens through which to\n\nanalyze the Colony’s claim.\n\n¶22    We instead apply the standard used by the Court in Dept. of Human Resources of\n\nOregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 878, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 1599 (1990). The workers’\n\ncompensation requirement must be facially neutral and serve a secular purpose in order to\n\nsurvive a Free Exercise challenge. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1599. The\n\nrequirement also must impose only an incidental burden on religious conduct as opposed to a\n\nprohibition on religious conduct. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1599.\n\n       Facially Neutral and Secular Purpose.\n\n¶23    The District Court concluded that HB 119 “unquestionably targets only the Hutterite\n\nreligious practice of communal living.” This conclusion ignores the fact that the workers’\n                                             8\n\fcompensation requirement in Montana applies generally to multiple types of entities. See\n\n§ 39-71-117, MCA. The legislature did not conceive of the workers’ compensation system\n\nas a means to shackle the religious practices of Colony members. HB 119 simply adds to the\n\nscope of the workers’ compensation system religious corporations that engage in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration through its expansion of the definition of\n\n“employer” contained in § 39-71-117, MCA.\n\n¶24    No doubt exists that the workers’ compensation requirement would apply if the\n\nColony employed its members to work for wages on these commercial activities. Indeed, in\n\nSt. John’s Lutheran Church v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, 252 Mont. 516, 524, 830 P.2d 1271,\n\n1277 (1992), this Court rejected a Free Exercise challenge to the requirement that the church\n\nprovide workers’ compensation coverage to its pastor on the basis that the provision of\n\nworkers’ compensation represents “an overriding governmental interest.” No doubt exists\n\nthat the workers’ compensation requirement would apply if the Colony opted to establish\n\nseparate commercial entities to perform the type of work at issue here. See Ridley Park\n\nMethodist Church v. Zoning Hearing Board, 920 A.2d 953, 960 (Pa. 2007) (denying zoning\n\nvariance to operate a daycare on church site did not impinge on religious activities of church\n\nas operation of the daycare “is not a fundamental religious activity of a church”).\n\n¶25    The Dissent suggests that HB 119 would not capture the activities of the other\n\nreligious employers, in part, because they do not engage in the types of economic activities\n\nenumerated by HB 119. Dissent, ¶ 88. HB 119 did not need to capture these other religious\n\nemployers, however, to incorporate them into the workers’ compensation system. Section\n\n39-71-117(1)(a), MCA, already captures other religious employers who engage in\n                                              9\n\fcommercial activities. Subsection (a) includes within the definition of “employer” “all\n\npublic corporations and quasi-public corporations,” religious or otherwise. Subsection (a)\n\nfurther includes within the definition of “employer” “each firm, voluntary association,\n\nlimited liability company, limited liability partnership, and private corporation,” religious or\n\notherwise. Finally, subsection (c) defines employer to include “any non-profit association,\n\nlimited liability company, limited liability partnership, or corporation or other entity,”\n\nreligious or otherwise, that receives federal, state, or local government funds to be used for\n\ncommunity service programs.\n\n¶26    The Department of Labor and Industry previously did not consider the Colony subject\n\nto the workers’ compensation system due to the fact that the Colony did not pay “wages” to\n\nits members as part of its communal living system. The Colony nevertheless engaged in\n\ncommercial activities. The Colony instead provides food, shelter, clothing, and medical care\n\nto its members who engage in these commercial activities. See Stahl v. United States, 626\n\nF.3d 520, 521 (9th Cir. 2010). HB 119 clarified that religious corporations, organizations, or\n\ntrusts that engage in specified commercial activities, who do not pay “wages” to their\n\nmembers for labor on these commercial activities, but who receive remuneration from\n\nnonmembers, qualify as “employers” for purposes of the workers’ compensation system.\n\nSection 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. HB 119 does not lose its facial neutrality or shed its secular\n\npurpose due to the fact that it sought to include the colony’s commercial activities, as\n\nopposed to its religious practices, within the scope of the workers’ compensation system.\n\n       Incidental Burden or Prohibition on Religious Conduct.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f¶27    The District Court pronounced that the communal lifestyle represents the Hutterites’\n\n“most distinguishing feature.” This communal lifestyle merges religious exercise and labor\n\nas a member voluntarily contributes all of his property and labor to the Colony “as an\n\nexpression of faith and worship.” This attribute led the District Court to determine that\n\napplication of HB 119 to the Colony’s commercial activities transformed a potentially valid\n\nregulation into an outright prohibition on religious conduct. Courts uniformly have rejected\n\nthe notion that a party’s religious motivation for undertaking an act can transform a generally\n\napplicable regulation into a prohibition on religious conduct. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.\n\nCt. at 1600. Other courts have recognized that this logic, taken to its extreme, would\n\nsubsume every facet of a religious organization into a religious activity.\n\n¶28    The Court in Smith dismissed the notion that the “religious motivation” for using\n\npeyote placed the two employees beyond the reach of a criminal law not directed specifically\n\nat their religious practice. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1600. Alfred Smith and\n\nGalen Black were fired from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation organization\n\nbecause they ingested peyote for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Native American\n\nChurch, of which both were members. The employment division denied their claims for\n\nunemployment due to the fact that they had been discharged for work-related “misconduct.”\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 874, 110 S. Ct. at 1598. The two brought a Free Exercise challenge to the\n\ndivision’s denial.\n\n¶29    The Court recognized, similar to the Colony’s claim, that the exercise of religion often\n\ninvolves not only belief, “but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts.” Smith,\n\n494 U.S. at 877, 110 S. Ct. at 1599. These acts include “assembling with others for a\n                                              11\n\fworship service, participating in sacramental use of bread and wine, proselytizing, abstaining\n\nfrom certain foods or certain modes of transportation.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 877, 110 S. Ct. at\n\n1599. The Court noted, in an obvious foreshadowing of its decision in Lukumi Babalu, that\n\nit likely would be unconstitutional if a state attempted to ban such acts or abstentions only\n\nwhen a person engages in them for religious reasons. Smith, 494 U.S. at 877-78, 110 S. Ct.\n\nat 1599.\n\n¶30    The Court upheld the denial of benefits based largely upon the fact that peyote use\n\nhad not been prohibited for religious reasons. The “right of free exercise does not relieve an\n\nindividual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid and neutral law of general applicability\n\non the grounds that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or\n\nproscribes).’” Smith, 494 U.S. at 879, 110 S. Ct. at 1600, quoting United States v. Lee, 455\n\nU.S. 252, 263 n.3, 102 S. Ct. 1051, 1058, n.3 (Stevens, J. concurring). HB 119 does not ban\n\nColony members from engaging in commercial activities with nonmembers for\n\nremuneration. It simply regulates this activity by requiring the Colony to provide workers’\n\ncompensation insurance for its members when they engage in these commercial activities.\n\nSee also Mount Elliott Cemetery Assoc. v. City of Troy, 171 F.3d 398, 403 (6th Cir. 1999)\n\n(noting that the Free Exercise Clause does not prevent the government from regulating\n\nbehavior associated with religious beliefs).\n\n¶31    The U.S. Supreme Court in Alamo Foundation v. Sec’ty of Labor, 471 U.S. 290, 105\n\nS. Ct. 1953 (1985), similarly determined that the imposition of generally applicable secular\n\nregulations on the volunteer labor of religious members who lived in a communal setting\n\nconstituted an incidental burden on religion rather than a prohibition on religious conduct.\n                                               12\n\fThe Alamo Foundation, a non-profit religious organization, challenged the application of the\n\nminimum wage, overtime, and recordkeeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act\n\n(FLSA). The Foundation argued that it staffed its numerous commercial operations,\n\nincluding service stations, retail clothing and grocery outlets, hog farms, roofing and\n\nelectrical construction companies, a recordkeeping company, a motel, and companies\n\nengaged in the production and distribution of candy, entirely with volunteers, known as\n\n“associates.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 292, 105 S. Ct. at 1957.\n\n¶32    These associates typically had been “drug addicts, derelicts, or criminals” before their\n\nconversion and rehabilitation by the Foundation. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 292, 105 S.\n\nCt. at 1957. The associates received no cash salaries. The Foundation instead provided them\n\nwith food, clothing, shelter, and other benefits. The Secretary of Labor initiated an action\n\nagainst the Foundation based upon the notion that the Foundation was “engaged in ordinary\n\ncommercial activities in competition with other commercial businesses.” Alamo Foundation,\n\n471 U.S. at 293, 105 S. Ct. at 1957. As a result, the Secretary argued that the “economic\n\nreality” test of employment demonstrated that the associates qualified as employees.\n\n¶33    The Court examined the Foundation’s claim that the associates functioned as\n\n“volunteers” without any expectation of compensation. In fact, one associate testified\n\nconvincingly that “no one ever expected any kind of compensation, and the thought is totally\n\nvexing to my soul.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 301, 105 S. Ct. at 1961. Despite the\n\nheart-felt protests of this associate and others, application of the “economic reality” test\n\nrevealed that the associates expected, indeed relied upon, the benefits conferred by the\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fFoundation in the form of food, clothing, and shelter. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 301,\n\n105 S. Ct. at 1961.\n\n¶34    The Court further rejected the Foundation’s claim that application of the generally\n\napplicable minimum wage and recordkeeping requirements failed to rise to the level of a\n\nprohibition on religious conduct. The Court reasoned that the FLSA does not require the\n\npayment of “cash wages.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 303-04, 105 S. Ct. at 1963. The\n\nFLSA defines wages to include many of the same benefits that the associates received. With\n\nrespect to the amount of the benefits, the Court noted that nothing in the FLSA would\n\n“prevent the associates from returning the [excess] amounts to the Foundation, provided that\n\nthey do so voluntarily.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 304, 105 S. Ct. at 1963.\n\n¶35    A church in South Ridge Baptist Church v. Industrial Comm’n of Ohio, 911 F.2d 1203\n\n(6th Cir. 1990), filed a declaratory judgment action remarkably similar to the Colony’s\n\ndispute here, in which it alleged that the compulsory payment of workers’ compensation\n\npremiums on behalf of its employees was “sinful.” The court recognized that the generally\n\napplicable requirement of workers’ compensation coverage imposed some incidental burden\n\non the church’s free exercise of its religious beliefs. The court held, however, that “Ohio’s\n\ninterest in the solvency of the workers’ compensation fund” outweighed any incidental\n\nburden imposed on the church.        The court premised this conclusion on the state’s\n\nfundamental police power to safeguard the welfare of its citizens. South Ridge Baptist\n\nChurch, 911 F.2d at 1208. See also United States v. Indianapolis Baptist Temple, 224 F.3d\n\n627 (7th Cir. 2000) (rejecting church’s Free Exercise challenge to a requirement that it pay\n\nunemployment tax for its employees).\n                                             14\n\f¶36    The Court applied a similar analysis to mandatory payment of a generally applicable\n\nsales and use tax in Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization, 493 U.S. 378, 110\n\nS. Ct. 688 (1990). The constitution and bylaws of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries provide that it\n\n“is called for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an evangelistic outreach for the\n\nworship of Almighty God.” Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 381, 110 S. Ct. at 691.\n\nJimmy Swaggart Ministries sold merchandise during 23 crusades in California during the\n\nperiod of 1974 through 1981. This merchandise contained specific religious content –\n\nBibles, Bible study materials, printed sermons and collections of sermons, audiocassette\n\ntapes of sermons, religious books and pamphlets, and religious music in the form of song-\n\nbooks, tapes, and records. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 383, 110 S. Ct. at 692.\n\n¶37    The Court analyzed first whether the government “has placed a substantial burden on\n\nthe observation of a central religious belief or practice.” Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493\n\nU.S. at 383, 110 S. Ct. at 693 (emphasis added). The Court rejected the claim that the sales\n\nand use tax constituted a tax “on the right to disseminate religious information, ideas, or\n\nbeliefs.” The Court instead characterized the sales and use tax as a tax “on the privilege of\n\nmaking retail sales of tangible personal property” in California. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries,\n\n493 U.S. at 389, 110 S. Ct. at 696. California treated the sale of a Bible by a religious\n\norganization in the same manner that it treats the sale of a Bible by a bookstore: both would\n\nbe subject to the tax. See Knights of Columbus v. Town of Lexington, 272 F.3d 25, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2001) (content-neutral ban on unattended structures on historic Battle Green, site of first\n\nbattle of Revolutionary War, that eliminated Christmas crèche survived Free Exercise\n\nchallenge).\n                                              15\n\f¶38    The Court further rejected the notion that the collection and payment of the tax would\n\nviolate the sincere religious beliefs of Jimmy Swaggart Ministries. The reduction in income\n\nto Jimmy Swaggart Ministries represented the only burden imposed by the tax. The Court\n\ndeemed “not constitutionally significant” this reduction in the amount of money available to\n\nJimmy Swaggart Ministries to spend on religious activities caused by the imposition of this\n\ngenerally applicable tax. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 391, 110 S. Ct. at 696; see\n\nalso Employment Division v. Rogue Valley Youth for Christ, 770 P.2d 588 (Ore. 1989)\n\n(applying unemployment compensation taxation scheme to religious organizations did not\n\noffend Free Exercise Clause).\n\n¶39    The Court in Jimmy Swaggart Ministries referred repeatedly to a “generally”\n\napplicable tax. E.g., Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 395, 110 S. Ct. 698. The Court\n\ndid not require a tax to apply universally in order for it to be considered neutral toward\n\nreligious entities. See Indianapolis Baptist Temple, 224 F.2d at 629 (describing federal\n\nunemployment tax laws as laws of “general” application). In the present case, the District\n\nCourt rejected the notion that Sections 6 and 7 were generally applicable laws based on its\n\ndetermination that the “object of the legislation was remote from the concerns and purpose\n\nunderlying the Workers’ Compensation Act.” The District Court instead viewed HB 119 as\n\n“an attempt to ‘tax’ the Hutterites for a religious practice.”\n\n¶40    The Court in United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 102 S. Ct. 1051 (1982), addressed a\n\nfree exercise challenge to the mandatory participation of an Amish employer in the social\n\nsecurity system. The Court noted that Congress had sought to accommodate, to the extent\n\ncompatible with a comprehensive national program, the practices of those who believe it a\n                                              16\n\fviolation of their faith to participate in the social security system. Lee, 455 U.S. at 260, 102\n\nS. Ct. at 1057. The Court cited the exemptions on religious grounds for self-employed\n\nAmish as an example of the efforts by Congress to accommodate religious beliefs. Lee, 455\n\nU.S. at 260, 102 S. Ct. at 1057. The Court further recognized, however, that when\n\n“followers of a particular [religious] sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,\n\nthe limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\n\nsuperimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.” Lee,\n\n455 U.S. at 261, 102 S. Ct. at 1057.\n\n¶41    The legislature’s regulation of the activities of Colony members would violate the\n\nright of members to exercise freely their religion only when the regulation impermissibly\n\nsingles out “some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because it is\n\nundertaken for religious reasons.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226. The\n\nworkers’ compensation system in Montana generally applies to all employers engaged in\n\ncommercial activities. Section 39-71-401, MCA. The inclusion of religious organizations\n\nthat engage voluntarily in commercial activities within the workers’ compensation system\n\ndoes not single out religious beliefs. Lee, 455 U.S. at 261, 102 S. Ct. at 1057. And neither\n\ndoes HB 119’s inclusion of religious organizations within the workers’ compensation system\n\nregulate or prohibit any conduct “because it is undertaken for religious reasons.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226.\n\n¶42    Courts routinely have rejected Free Exercise challenges to compelled participation by\n\nreligious organizations in a wide variety of social welfare programs. These programs range\n\nfrom a similar workers’ compensation system to the one at issue here, South Baptist Temple,\n                                               17\n\fto social security, Lee, to unemployment tax systems, Indianapolis Baptist Temple and\n\nValley Youth for Christ, to federal minimum wage and overtime and recordkeeping\n\nrequirements, Alamo Foundation, to state sales and use taxes, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.\n\nEach of these religious organizations presented sincere and heartfelt beliefs that its\n\nparticipation in the governmental program violated its religious beliefs. The courts rejected\n\neach claim. We, too, reject the Colony’s Free Exercise challenge to its participation in\n\nMontana’s workers’ compensation system for Colony members engaged in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration. The decision of the legislature to include in\n\nthe definition of “employer” religious corporations that voluntarily engage in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration fails to establish evidence of discrimination\n\nagainst religious organizations. Cf. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1599-1600.\n\n¶43    Issue 2. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the\n\ndefinition of “employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under\n\nthe Workers’ Compensation Act violate the Establishment Clause.\n\n¶44    Lemon provides the test to analyze government conduct under the Establishment\n\nClause of the First Amendment. The government conduct at issue must (1) have a secular\n\npurpose, (2) not have as its principal or primary effect inhibiting religion, and (3) not foster\n\nexcessive entanglement with religion. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S. Ct. at 2111. Courts\n\nmost commonly apply Lemon to situations in which the government allegedly has given\n\npreference to a religion. Roemer v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 96 S. Ct. 2337\n\n(1976). The Lemon test likewise accommodates evaluation of a claim brought under the\n\ntheory of hostility to religion. Vernon v. City of Los Angeles, 27 F.3d 1385, 1396 (9th Cir.\n                                              18\n\f1994) (applying Lemon to a claim that the City of Los Angeles’s investigation of a police\n\nofficer was prompted by hostility to the officer’s religious beliefs).\n\n¶45     The purpose prong of Lemon asks whether the government’s actual purpose “is to\n\nendorse or disapprove of religion.” Kreisner v. City of San Diego, 1 F.3d 775, 782 (9th Cir.\n\n1993). As a practical matter, however, a government practice will stumble on the purpose\n\nprong “only if it is motivated wholly by an impermissible purpose.” Bowen v. Kendrick, 487\n\nU.S. 589, 602, 108 S. Ct. 2562, 2570 (1988). We cannot agree with the District Court that an\n\nimpermissible purpose wholly motivated the legislature’s inclusion of Sections 6 and 7 in\n\nHB 119.\n\n¶46    The Court in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 220, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 1535 (1972),\n\nabrogated in part, Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, recognized “even when religiously\n\nbased, [one’s activities] are often subject to regulation by the States in the exercise of their\n\nundoubted power to promote the health, safety, and general welfare.” The workers’\n\ncompensation system in Montana undoubtedly promotes the health, safety, and welfare of\n\nworkers. Walters v. Flathead Concrete Prods., Inc., 2011 MT 45, ¶ 28, 359 Mont. 346, 249\n\nP.3d 913.    The decision by the legislature to ensure coverage under the workers’\n\ncompensation system to members of religious organizations engaged in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration furthers this secular purpose.\n\n¶47    The District Court further determined the primary effect of including the Colony’s\n\nmembers in the workers’ compensation system “would be to inhibit the Colony in the\n\npractice of their religion.” We evaluate this question from the perspective of a “reasonable\n\nobserver.” Kreisner, 1 F.3d at 784. In this regard, we must keep in mind that the\n                                              19\n\fEstablishment Clause does not demand “that we elevate a group of persons to a privileged\n\nstatus, above all [others], because of their religious beliefs.” Hofer v. DPHHS, 2005 MT\n\n302, ¶ 42, 329 Mont. 368, 124 P.3d 1098. We must consider instead whether it would be\n\nobjectively reasonable for the government action to be construed as sending primarily a\n\nmessage of either endorsement or disapproval of religion. County of Allegheny v. ACLU,\n\n492 U.S. 573, 592-93, 109 S. Ct. 3086, 3100-01 (1989).\n\n¶48    The legislature has chosen to include religious corporations that engage in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration in the workers’ compensation system. The\n\nworkers’ compensation system applies to many other types of corporations and other entities\n\norganized in various fashions that engage in commercial activities. Section 39-71-117(a),\n\n(b), and (c), MCA. No reasonable observer would construe the legislature’s explicit\n\ninclusion in the workers’ compensation system of religious corporations that engage in\n\ncommercial activities with nonmembers for remuneration, along with various other types of\n\ncorporations and entities, as sending a message of disapproval of religion. Cf. County of\n\nAllegheny, 492 U.S. at 592-93, 109 S. Ct. at 3100-01.\n\n¶49    The third prong of the Lemon test requires the court to examine whether the\n\ngovernment action results in “an excessive government entanglement with religion.” Lemon,\n\n403 U.S. at 613, 91 S. Ct. at 2111. The entanglement prong “seeks to minimize the\n\ninterference of religious authorities with secular affairs and secular authorities in religious\n\naffairs.” Cammack v. Waihee, 932 F.2d 765, 780 (9th Cir. 1991).                Administrative\n\nentanglement typically involves comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state\n\nsurveillance of religion. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 619-22, 91 S. Ct. at 2114-15.\n                                              20\n\f¶50    The Supreme Court usually has found excessive entanglement in situations that\n\ninvolve either state aid to groups affiliated with a religious institution, such as parochial\n\nschools, see, e.g., Aguilar; Roemer; Levitt v. Committee for Public Educ. & Religious\n\nLiberty, 413 U.S. 472, 93 S. Ct. 2814 (1973); Lemon, or where religious employees and\n\npublic employees must work closely together, Aguilar, 473 U.S. at 412-14, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n3237-39 (program required on-site monitoring of sectarian schools by public authorities and\n\ncoordinated planning by public and sectarian figures). The Colony’s claim presents none of\n\nthese situations.\n\n¶51    Courts look first to the character and purpose of the religious institution affected by\n\nthe government action. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 615, 91 S. Ct. at 2112. Courts next assess the\n\nnature of the activity that the government mandates. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 615, 91 S. Ct. at\n\n2112. And finally, courts evaluate the resulting relationship between the government and the\n\nreligious institution. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 615, 91 S. Ct. at 2112. See also Jimmy Swaggart\n\nMinistries, 493 U.S. at 393, 110 S. Ct. at 697.\n\n¶52    The Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 303, 105 S. Ct. at 1962, presented a similar\n\nexcessive entanglement claim. The Court recognized that the recordkeeping requirement\n\nimposed by the FLSA applied only to commercial activities undertaken for a “business\n\npurpose.” The recordkeeping requirement would have no impact on the Foundation’s “own\n\nevangelical activities or on individuals engaged in volunteer work.” Alamo Foundation, 471\n\nU.S. at 305, 105 S. Ct. at 1963.\n\n¶53    The workers’ compensation requirement here applies only to those religious\n\ncorporations that receive “remuneration” from nonmembers for “agricultural production,\n                                             21\n\fmanufacturing, or a construction project.” Section 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. Any extra\n\nbookkeeping or recordkeeping would apply only to the Colony’s commercial activities\n\nundertaken for a “business purpose.” Cf. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 305, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n1963. No extra bookkeeping or recordkeeping would be required for labor conducted by\n\nColony members for support of the Colony. The court’s decision in Stahl, 626 F.3d 520,\n\nprovides further persuasive reasoning.\n\n¶54    There the president of the Stahl Hutterian Brethren sought a refund of a portion of his\n\npersonal income taxes. The Stahl Hutterian Brethren is a nonprofit apostolic corporation that\n\nmaintains a common treasury and pays no income tax. Members instead pay personal\n\nincome taxes on their pro rata share of the corporation’s income. Stahl, 626 F.3d at 521.\n\nMembers live a communal lifestyle similar to the Colony and engage mainly in agriculture.\n\nThe corporation farms 30,000 acres of land and produces dairy products and a variety of\n\ncrops that it sells to other businesses and at farmers markets. Stahl, 626 F.3d at 521.\n\n¶55    The corporation members disavow individual personal property ownership, and, as a\n\nresult, members receive no salaries from the corporation. The corporation maintains and\n\nuses all of its property for the benefit of its members. The corporation, in turn, provides for\n\nthe members’ personal needs, including food, shelter, clothing, and medical care. Stahl, 626\n\nF.3d at 521.\n\n¶56    The president brought an action to obtain an income tax refund on the basis that the\n\ncorporate income level should have been reduced for tax purposes before his pro-rata share\n\npassed through to him. He argued that the costs of meals and medical expenses of the\n\ncorporation’s employees constituted ordinary and necessary business expenses. Stahl, 626\n                                              22\n\fF.3d at 522. The district court determined that none of the corporation’s members, including\n\nthe president, qualified as employees for tax purposes. Stahl, 626 F.3d at 522.\n\n¶57    The Ninth Circuit reversed. The court evaluated whether the corporation’s members\n\nqualified as employees for tax purposes under federal law. This analysis led the court to\n\ndetermine that “the individual Hutterites” who work for the corporation should be seen “as\n\ncommon law employees” to the extent that these individual members perform the work of\n\nthe corporation. Stahl, 626 F.3d at 527. The court remanded for consideration of the\n\npresident’s claims for deductions.\n\n¶58    On remand, the district court granted the president’s claim for deduction. With\n\nrespect to food, the court reasoned that the corporation’s dairy farm operation required round\n\nthe clock supervision. These employees must be fed. Stahl v. United States, 861 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1226, 1231 (E.D. Wa. 2012). Likewise, the court concluded that the corporation had\n\nprovided food and medical care to the president in return for his labor.\n\n¶59    The court recognized that the corporation and its members had created a community\n\nthat functions largely without wages. Employee compensation in a wageless community\n\ntakes the form of housing, food, and medical care. The fact that the corporation and its\n\nmembers had chosen this wageless community for religious reasons proved “irrelevant” as\n\nlong as the items that the corporation claims as compensation – food and medical care – truly\n\nfunction as compensation in the community. Stahl, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 1231. Similar\n\nreasoning applied to medical expenses incurred by the corporation to purchase a health plan\n\nfor the president and the corporation’s members and payment for any uninsured charges.\n\nStahl, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 1232.\n                                             23\n\f¶60    The Court in Jimmy Swaggart Ministries noted that the organization possessed a\n\nsophisticated accounting staff and had the ability to segregate retail sales and donations for\n\npurposes of obtaining a federal income tax exemption on these donations. Thus, Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries easily could track the revenue generated by its retail sales. The Court\n\nfurther recognized that imposition of the tax involved a determination only of whether a sale\n\nhad taken place and required no determination of whether the materials sold were religious in\n\nnature. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 396, 110 S. Ct. at 699. The fact that Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries placed a price on its merchandise relieved California of the need to\n\nundertake any independent valuation of any religious items. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries,\n\n493 U.S. at 396, 110 S. Ct. at 699; see also Hofer, ¶ 43 (concluding that an express trust\n\nexists between the Hutterite colony and its members and therefore the colony’s resources are\n\navailable to members when considering a member’s eligibility for the Family-Related\n\nMedicaid Program).\n\n¶61    The court in South Ridge Baptist similarly rejected an excessive entanglement claim.\n\nThe burden imposed by the requirement that the church provide workers’ compensation\n\ncoverage for its employees differed little from the church’s other involvements with the state.\n\nOhio law required the church’s payroll and wage expenditures to be open for inspection.\n\nThese payroll reports are sent every six months to employers to be completed and returned.\n\nThe church would be obligated to report job-related injuries or illnesses and report aggregate\n\nwages and the number of employees. None of this information delved into “the religious\n\nbeliefs of the clergy or the congregation.” South Ridge Baptist, 911 F.2d at 1210. Moreover,\n\nthe church undoubtedly remains “subject to a variety of state public welfare regulations,\n                                              24\n\ffrom the zoning, building and fire codes applicable to its place of worship . . . to federal\n\nminimum wage and other labor standards governing [its] employment practices.” South\n\nRidge Baptist, 911 F.2d at 1211.\n\n¶62    The Dissent laments that HB 119 creates a substantial intrusion into the religious\n\npractices of the Colony and its members. Dissent, ¶ 99. Neither the Dissent, nor the Colony\n\nfor that matter, claim that other state regulations of the Colony’s commercial activities pose\n\nsubstantial intrusions into the religious practices of the Colony and its members. For\n\nexample, Title 81 of the Montana Code Annotated regulates commercial agricultural\n\nproducers of poultry, dairy, and other products. Title 81 further authorizes the Department\n\nof Agriculture and county boards of health to promulgate health and safety regulations for\n\ncommercial agricultural producers. These regulations necessarily require some entanglement\n\nbetween the State and producers of commercial agricultural products, including the Colony.\n\n¶63    The information necessary for the Colony to comply with participation in the\n\nworkers’ compensation system would not delve into the religious beliefs of the Colony or its\n\nmembers. It further appears that the requirement to provide workers’ compensation coverage\n\nfor its members engaged in commercial activities poses no more burdensome recordkeeping\n\nrequirement than those outlined in Stahl. The Colony presently maintains financial records\n\nbased on its status as a religious corporation so that its members, similar to the religious\n\ncorporation in Stahl, may file tax returns. Finally, as the Department asserts, the Colony\n\nretains the option to self-insure as a means to limit excessive entanglement. Section 39-71-\n\n2101, MCA. We cannot agree with the District Court’s conclusion that “a comprehensive,\n\ndiscriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that\n                                             25\n\fonly particular areas of Hutterite activity are scrutinized.” The recordkeeping required to\n\nestablish compliance with Montana’s workers’ compensation system constitutes a valid\n\nregulation of the Colony’s commercial activities.\n\n¶64    Issue 3. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the\n\ndefinition of “employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under\n\nthe Workers’ Compensation Act violate the Colony’s right to equal protection of the laws.\n\n¶65    The District Court determined that the separate classification created by Sections 6\n\nand 7 “treats Hutterites differently from other religious organizations and further targets\n\nreligious organizations generally.” A party who asserts an equal protection claim based on a\n\nworkers’ compensation statute must satisfy two separate criteria. Wilkes v. Mont. State\n\nFund, 2008 MT 29, ¶ 12, 342 Mont. 292, 177 P.3d 483. The party first must demonstrate\n\nthat the legislature has created a classification that treats differently two or more similarly\n\nsituated groups. Wilkes, ¶ 12. Once the party has demonstrated a classification that treats\n\ngroups differently, the party must demonstrate that the discriminatory classification\n\nrationally relates to no legitimate governmental purpose. Wilkes, ¶ 12.\n\n¶66    The Colony claims that HB 119 singles out the Hutterites and treats them differently\n\nthan other similarly situated groups. The Colony identifies two separate sets of “similarly\n\nsituated groups.” The Colony first argues that HB 119 treats the Colony differently than any\n\nother religious groups. The Colony further argues that HB 119 treats religious groups\n\ndifferently from non-religious groups.\n\n¶67    The Colony argues that its commitment to communal living prevents a member from\n\nowning property. As a result, a Colony member who received any compensation for lost\n                                              26\n\fwages pursuant to a workers’ compensation claim immediately would have to forfeit the\n\nmoney to the Colony or face possible excommunication from the Colony. The Colony\n\nclaims, however, that HB 119 somehow would prevent the Colony from proceeding to\n\nexcommunicate a member who received a workers’ compensation claim payment. The\n\nColony further claims that no other religion bans ownership of property, and, therefore, HB\n\n119 would affect only the Colony in this manner.\n\n¶68    We first note that nothing prevents an injured Colony member from refraining to file a\n\nworkers’ compensation claim or returning any workers’ compensation claim award to the\n\nColony. Cf. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 304, 105 S. Ct. at 1963. More importantly,\n\nnothing in HB 119 or any other provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act prevents the\n\nColony from proceeding to excommunicate a member who receives compensation for lost\n\nwages and refuses to give the money to the Colony. HB 119 treats the Colony no differently\n\nthan any religious groups that do not prevent ownership of property.\n\n¶69    The Colony next argues that HB 119 creates a group of religious employers and a\n\ngroup of all other employers. HB 119 amended the definition of “employer” explicitly to\n\ninclude religious corporations, organizations, or trusts that engage in commercial activities\n\nwith nonmembers for remuneration. The Colony claims that the exclusive focus in Section 6\n\nof HB 119 on religious employers results in a system that treats religious employers\n\ndifferently than non-religious employers.\n\n¶70    We look to a statute’s plain language to interpret it. Delaney & Co. v. City of\n\nBozeman, 2009 MT 441, ¶ 22, 354 Mont. 181, 222 P.3d 618. We must read a whole act\n\ntogether and where possible we must give full effect to all statutes involved. Delaney & Co.,\n                                             27\n\f¶ 22. Accordingly, we look to the entirety of the Workers’ Compensation Act, rather than to\n\na single subsection, to determine whether the Workers’ Compensation Act treats religious\n\nemployers differently than non-religious employers.\n\n¶71    Section 39-71-117, MCA, sets forth in mind-numbing detail the full definition of\n\n“employer” for purposes of the workers’ compensation system. This extensive definition,\n\nincluding subsections (a), (b), and (c), all of which predated HB 119, applies generally to\n\nreligious and non-religious entities alike. The definition of “employer” includes the state,\n\ncounties, cities, public corporations, quasi-public corporations, private corporations,\n\nindividual people, associations, limited liability companies, and nonprofit associations, as\n\nwell as numerous other entities. Section 39-71-117(a), (b), and (c), MCA. HB 119 simply\n\nadds religious organizations to the types of entities that qualify as an “employer” for\n\npurposes of the workers’ compensation system. HB 119 treats religious organizations no\n\ndifferently than any other employer under the workers’ compensation system. A review of\n\nthe complete list of entities that qualify as an “employer” for purposes of the workers’\n\ncompensation system reveals that the Workers’ Compensation Act creates no separate\n\nclassification under HB 119 that singles out religious groups for different treatment.\n\n¶72    The Colony’s failure to establish that HB 119 creates “two separate similarly situated\n\ngroups” that receive unequal treatment under the Workers’ Compensation Act ends our\n\ninquiry. This failure to establish two separate groups relieves the Court of the need to\n\nevaluate whether the alleged disparate treatment rationally relates to any legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest. Bustell v. AIG Claims Serv., 2004 MT 362, ¶ 22, 324 Mont. 478, 105\n\nP.3d 286.\n                                             28\n\f                                       CONCLUSION\n\n¶73   We recognize that the issues in dispute present intractable problems that no court ever\n\nwill resolve to the satisfaction of all parties. Justice O’Connor, in rejecting a challenge\n\nbrought by Native Americans to enjoin a United States forest service road through sacred\n\nareas, summed up our dilemma:\n\n      However much we might wish that it were otherwise, government simply\n      could not operate if it were required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs\n      and desires. A broad range of government activities -- from social welfare\n      programs to foreign aid to conservation projects -- will always be considered\n      essential to the spiritual well-being of some citizens, often on the basis of\n      sincerely held religious beliefs. Others will find the very same activities\n      deeply offensive, and perhaps incompatible with their own search for spiritual\n      fulfillment and with the tenets of their religion. The First Amendment must\n      apply to all citizens alike, and it can give to none of them a veto over public\n      programs that do not prohibit the free exercise of religion. The Constitution\n      does not, and courts cannot, offer to reconcile the various competing demands\n      on government, many of them rooted in sincere religious belief, that inevitably\n      arise in so diverse a society as ours. That task, to the extent that it is feasible,\n      is for the legislatures and other institutions.\n\n\n\nLyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Ass’n, 485 U.S. 439, 452, 108 S. Ct. 1319,\n\n1327 (1988).\n\n¶74   Reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of the Department.\n\n\n                                                   /S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n\n\nWe Concur:\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ BETH BAKER\n\n                                              29\n\fJustice James C. Nelson, dissenting.\n\n\n¶75    I join Justice Rice’s well-reasoned and compelling Dissent.\n\n¶76    Although in today’s society and politics the principle is honored more in the breach,\n\nthis Country was founded on the seminal precept that there is a wall of separation between\n\nchurch and state. See Donaldson v. State, 2012 MT 288, ¶ 194, ___ Mont. ___, ___ P.3d ___\n\n(Nelson, J., dissenting). To that end, the First Amendment and Article II, Section 5 of\n\nMontana’s Constitution both contain clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal proscriptions:\n\nCongress and the State shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\n\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\n¶77    Yet here, as Justice Rice explains, in order to level some theoretical economic playing\n\nfield and to pacify the complaints of one industry, the Legislature enacted a law targeting\n\nHutterite colonies and preventing them from being able to practice and comport with\n\nimportant doctrines of their religion—a religion that defines and drives every aspect of\n\nColony life.\n\n¶78    Today’s decision allows the State to do exactly what the Montana and United States\n\nConstitutions expressly prohibit. This Court’s decision allows the government to interfere\n\nwith the doctrinal belief systems of a religious institution and its members. Apparently,\n\nhenceforth, “no law” prohibiting the free exercise of religion does not actually mean “no\n\nlaw” in Montana. Rather, it means no law, except to the extent that the law greases the\n\nsqueaky wheel of a powerful industry.\n\n                                             30\n\f¶79    I dissent.\n\n                                                   /S/ JAMES C. NELSON\n\n\n\nJustice Jim Rice, dissenting.\n\n¶80    To reach its decision, the Court uses waves of generic statements that fail to account\n\nfor the facts of this case, the arguments of the Colony, and the applicable legal tests. The\n\nCourt makes no effort to determine whether the challenged legislation constitutes a religious\n\ngerrymander, even though courts “must survey meticulously the circumstances of\n\ngovernmental categories to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders.” Lukumi Babalu,\n\n508 U.S. at 534, 113 S. Ct. at 2227. The Court minimizes the Colony’s claim to merely\n\n“sincere and heartfelt beliefs that its participation in the governmental program violated its\n\nreligious beliefs,” and cites to numerous cases that reject claims of that nature, while failing\n\nto acknowledge that this case is factually, and fundamentally, different. Opinion, ¶ 42. I\n\nbelieve the facts and law, when properly considered, demonstrate that the Legislature created\n\na clear religious gerrymander applicable only to the Hutterites and that such action was not\n\njustified by a compelling state interest. I would affirm the District Court’s holding that their\n\nright to free exercise of religion was violated.\n\n¶81    A law affecting the constitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion is to be both\n\nfacially neutral and generally applicable. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 531-32, 113 S. Ct. at\n\n2226 (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 879-81, 110 S. Ct. at 1600-01). A law failing to satisfy the\n\nrequirements of neutrality and general applicability “must be justified by a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest.” Lukumi\n                                              31\n\fBabalu, 508 U.S. at 531-32, 113 S. Ct. at 2226. A law is not neutral if the text of the law has\n\na targeting effect or a discriminatory object as discerned from direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 533-34, 113 S. Ct. at 2227. The Court in Lukumi\n\nBabalu stated:\n\n       Official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment cannot be\n       shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality. The\n       Free Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility which is masked\n       as well as overt. ‘The Court must survey meticulously the circumstances of\n       governmental categories to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders.’\n\nLukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 534, 113 S. Ct. at 2227 (quoting Walz v. Tax Comm’n of New\n\nYork City, 397 U.S. 664, 696, 90 S. Ct. 1409, 1425 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring)). In\n\ndetermining that the contested ordinances in Lukumi Babalu were not neutral, the Court\n\nreviewed the legislative record and history surrounding the enactment of the ordinances,\n\nstating, “the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 535, 113 S. Ct. at 2228. The Court found that the four contested\n\nordinances created an impermissible religious gerrymander because they “were drafted in\n\ntandem” to “target petitioners and their religious practices.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at\n\n535, 113 S. Ct. at 2228.\n\n¶82    To appreciate the Hutterites’ arguments, it is first necessary to understand their unique\n\nreligious principles. The Court offers generally that the Hutterite faith is one in which “all\n\nmembers agree to live a communal life and follow the teaching and tenets of the Hutterische\n\nChurch Society,” Opinion, ¶ 9, but fails to discuss the manner in which the Hutterites were\n\ntargeted or articulate the critical tenets which the legislation would require the Hutterites to\n\nviolate in order to participate in the workers’ compensation system.\n\n                                              32\n\f¶83    To begin, the record establishes that a hallmark of the Hutterite religion is the\n\ncommunal lifestyle where religious exercise and labor are not divisible because “[a]ll labor\n\nand support provided by members to the Colony is done for their own personal religious\n\npurpose without promise or expectation of compensation. The performance of labor and\n\nsupport for the Colony is an act of religious exercise.” Hutterites eat meals, worship, work,\n\nand are educated entirely communally and they do not associate with “non-members.” The\n\nMembership Declaration, to which every member of the Colony must subscribe, affirms each\n\nmember’s responsibility to relinquish current and future property rights to the Colony, and\n\nmembers are not permitted a wage or salary. In fact, the Hutterite faith prohibits the\n\npayment of wages for labor performed by its members. At oral argument, the State conceded\n\nthat the wage replacement component of workers’ compensation coverage would not be\n\napplicable to Colony members because, pursuant to their tenets of faith, they cannot receive\n\nwages.1 Farming and agricultural production has been a part of the Hutterite lifestyle for\n\nhundreds of years and is specifically named in the Colony’s Articles of Incorporation and the\n\nHutterian Brethren Church Constitution as a central component of the Colony’s livelihood.\n\nThe Colony also participates in manufacturing and construction projects.\n\n¶84    In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S. Ct. 1526 (1972), parents of Amish\n\nchildren challenged Wisconsin’s law requiring all children to attend school until age 16,\n\nclaiming that their beliefs required children to be educated within the Amish community\n\n1\n The State also argued that Colony members could nonetheless receive medical benefits from the\nmandated coverage, but this would require the forbidden act of filing a legal claim, discussed further\nherein. As to medical care, the record reflects that “the colonies fund the medical care that their\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fafter completion of eighth grade in order to limit exposure to worldly influences inconsistent\n\nwith their religious beliefs. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 210-13, 92 S. Ct. at 1530-32. The Supreme\n\nCourt held that Wisconsin’s compulsory school attendance law unduly burdened the Free\n\nExercise Clause by forcing Amish parents to send their children to public school after the\n\neighth grade in violation of one of the core Amish religious beliefs. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 234-\n\n35, 92 S. Ct. at 1542. In its analysis, the Supreme Court stated that “we must be careful to\n\ndetermine whether the Amish religious faith and their mode of life, are . . . inseparable and\n\ninterdependent.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215, 92 S. Ct. at 1533. As in Yoder, the record here\n\nsupports the determination that the communal way of life of the Colony is “one of deep\n\nreligious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living.”\n\nYoder, 406 U.S. at 216, 92 S. Ct. at 1533. The command to live communally and without\n\nproperty or legal claims is fundamental to the Hutterite faith.\n\n¶85    In addition to the communal lifestyle that requires renouncement of wages and the\n\nownership of property, and critical to an understanding of the conflict presented by their\n\ninclusion into the Workers’ Compensation Act, is the tenet that making a legal claim is a\n\nviolation of fundamental Hutterian doctrine. Daniel Wipf’s affidavit states that “Christians\n\nshall not sue one another at law nor sit in judgment of one another. Hutterites cannot make\n\nclaims against others for wrongs done to them.” The Membership Declaration, which every\n\nmember of the Colony must sign, states:\n\n              I declare that my acceptance of membership and the terms and\n       conditions of membership is a matter of my religious beliefs . . . Among those\n\nmembers need. Each individual Colony still provides full no-fault medical care for its members”\nand “[r]egardless of the reason for any member’s illness or injury, the member is cared for.”\n                                              34\n\f       beliefs is the commandment to live at peace with fellow believers, to resolve\n       disputes within the Church, and not to seek redress before secular authorities\n       whether related to secular or sectarian issues.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Wipf’s affidavit explains that a member who does not convey his or her\n\n“ownership” of a legal claim to the Colony, like other property, would be subject to\n\nexcommunication, or essentially termination from membership in the Colony. He states, “I\n\ndo not know of any Hutterite member who has made any workers’ compensation claim\n\nagainst a Hutterite colony in Montana or against the Uninsured Employers[’] Fund.”\n\n¶86    HB 119’s legislative history must be considered in order to understand the impact of\n\nthe bill. The United States Supreme Court has looked both to the text and to the legislative\n\nhistory of a law to determine whether legislators intended to target religious practices,\n\nLukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 533-34, 113 S. Ct. at 2227, although the Court fails to do so\n\nhere. The Department proposed HB 119 to address complaints received “about Hutterite\n\ncolonies competing with other Montana businesses, such as contractors, without having to\n\nprovide workers’ compensation insurance.”         The only religious group named in the\n\nlegislative debates surrounding HB 119 was the Hutterites, and both the House and the\n\nSenate specifically discussed the impact HB 119 would have on Hutterite colonies.\n\nRepresentative Hunter said, “[i]n particular, we are speaking of, in [Sections 6 and 7], about\n\nHutterite colonies” when he introduced HB 119 in the House Committee and reiterated this\n\nconcept to the Senate Committee. Mont. H. Comm. on Bus. & Labor, Hearing on H. Bill\n\n119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Jan. 8, 2009); Mont. Sen. Comm. on Bus., Labor, & Econ.\n\nAffairs, Hearing on H. Bill 119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 5, 2009). Senator Stewart-\n\nPeregoy characterized HB 119 and the corresponding Legislative debate as “targeting” the\n\n                                             35\n\fHutterites, stating, “if we’re going to target a group, we should have just put Hutterite\n\nreligious organizations and let’s be done with it. . . . [W]e are targeting a group and I just\n\nwanted that for the record.” Mont. Sen. Comm. on Bus., Labor, & Econ. Affairs, Hearing on\n\nH. Bill 119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 11, 2009). Additionally, Senator Balyeat\n\nacknowledged HB 119 was really “aimed” at the Hutterite religious colonies near Great\n\nFalls. Mont. Sen., Floor Session on H. Bill 119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 16, 2009).\n\nThe legislative record clearly shows that the objective intent of the legislators was none other\n\nthan to target the Hutterites.\n\n¶87    In response to this expressed legislative intention, the text of HB 119 was amended\n\nthroughout the legislative process to focus more and more narrowly on the Hutterites.\n\nLanguage was inserted within Section 6’s definition of employer to read “a religious\n\ncorporation, religious organization, or religious trust receiving remuneration from\n\nnonmembers for agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project\n\nconducted by its members on or off the property of the religious corporation, religious\n\norganization, or religious trust.” Section 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA (emphasis added). The\n\nlanguage “agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project”—instead of all\n\ncommercial activities—was inserted into HB 119 to incorporate only those specific business\n\nenterprises in which the Hutterites engaged. Here, the Court’s tactic of ignoring the facts\n\nand over-generalizing HB 119 and the Act as a whole in order to give the appearance that the\n\nAct applies equally to all employers is well illustrated. See Opinion, ¶ 21 (“HB 119\n\nregulates the Colony’s engagement in commercial activities in the same manner that the\n\nworkers’ compensation system regulates the commercial activities of other employers in\n                                              36\n\fMontana.”). The Court repeatedly states that HB 119 applies to all “commercial activities”\n\nand bases its analysis thereon. See Opinion ¶¶ 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 41, and 42.\n\nHowever, the text of HB 119 does not apply to “commercial activities” generally, nor does\n\nHB 119 use the term “commercial activities” at all. Rather, it employs the phrase\n\n“agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project”—only those economic\n\nactivities that the Legislature knew the Hutterites to be engaged in.\n\n¶88    Similarly, the Court makes repeated statements to the effect that all religious\n\nemployers are treated the same as other employers. See Opinion, ¶ 71 (“HB 119 treats\n\nreligious organizations no differently than any other employer under the workers’\n\ncompensation system”; “the Workers’ Compensation Act creates no separate classification\n\nunder HB 119 that singles out religious groups for different treatment.”). However, these\n\nstatements are not supported by the text of HB 119. Religious employers such as a\n\nPresbyterian Day Care, a Mormon Cleaning Service, or a Catholic Social Agency would not\n\nsatisfy HB 119’s definition of religious “employer” for multiple reasons, the first being that\n\nthey are not engaged in the economic activities targeted by the bill—“agricultural\n\nproduction, manufacturing, or a construction project.”2, 3\n\n\n2\n  These are examples of religious employers who would be exempt from participation under § 39-71-\n117(1)(d), MCA. However, it is possible that a social agency could come within the definition of\nemployer under § 39-71-117(c), MCA, if it was “funded in whole or in part by federal, state, or local\ngovernment funds.”\n3\n  The Court responds that HB 119 did not need to capture these other religious employers because\nthey and the Hutterites were already included under other statutory provisions. Opinion, ¶ 25. The\nCourt then reasons that the revision to the statutory definition of “wages” to include the concept of\n“remuneration” was all that was necessary to bring the Hutterites into the workers’ compensation\nsystem. Opinion, ¶ 26. The State has not made these assertions, and the Court cites neither to\nauthority nor to the record to support them. They are not supported by the plain language of the\nother provisions, which makes no reference to religious employers. If religious employers were\n                                                 37\n\f¶89    The Court distinguishes cases that have struck down legislation for violating the free\n\nexercise right by reasoning that HB 119 “does not place the Colony members in a\n\ndiscriminatory position compared to other religious groups who might choose to engage in\n\nsimilar activity. These distinctions lead us to reject the strict scrutiny analysis . . . .”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 21. Again, this distinction—and the conclusion based thereon to reject strict\n\nscrutiny review—is likewise belied by the text of HB 119. The Legislature cleverly drafted\n\nSections 6 and 7 to include only the Hutterites engaged in these economic activities and to\n\nexclude other religious groups. Under these provisions, an “employee” must be “a member”\n\nof the “religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust while performing\n\nservices” for the organization. Correspondingly, an “employer” is defined as a religious\n\norganization engaged in the targeted economic activities only when such activities are\n\n“conducted by its members.” See Section 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. As mentioned, all\n\nHutterite labor is provided by members of their communal organization. The “performance\n\nof labor” is a religious exercise required of every member “to the extent of his or her ability”\n\nand is provided for the “personal religious purpose” of the members. Hutterites do not\n\nassociate for these purposes with nonmembers, who provide no labor for the organization.\n\nBy merely hiring employees who are not “members” of their organization, other religious\n\n\nalready completely encompassed by other provisions, it would have been unnecessary to create the\nnew category of “religious organization” within the statutory definition of “employer,” as HB 119\ndid. See § 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. Likewise, it would have been unnecessary to create, within the\nstatutory definition of “employee,” the new category of a “member” of a religious organization\n“while performing services” for the religious organization. See § 39-71-118(1)(i), MCA. I note that\nthe former statutory provision under which the religious employer in St. John’s Lutheran Church\nwas required to participate in workers’ compensation was subsequently repealed. See Sec. 13, Ch.\n448, L. 2005. Context matters, and I believe that consideration of context should include all of the\n\n                                                38\n\forganizations choosing to participate in the named economic activities could be exempted\n\nfrom the provisions of HB 119. The tenets of the Hutterite religion, however, do not permit\n\nthis evasion, as their labor is provided by members only. HB 119 incorporates religious\n\norganizations within workers’ compensation only when “members” (§ 39-71-118(1)(i),\n\nMCA) of a religious organization provide labor and services to “nonmembers” (§ 39-71-\n\n117(1)(d), MCA)—a scheme which only applies to the religious structure of the Hutterites.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that any other religious organization would be\n\nincorporated into the workers’ compensation system under these provisions.\n\n¶90    The text reveals further targeting of the Hutterites. HB 119 created the new financial\n\ncategory of “remuneration,” § 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA, and in other provisions drafted in\n\ntandem, revised § 39-71-123(5), MCA, to incorporate a method for calculating remuneration\n\nso that the Act would apply to the Hutterites, who receive no wages. No other religious\n\norganization is identified in the record as using a non-wage system. HB 119’s application to\n\nthe specified economic activities when “conducted by its members on or off the property” of\n\nthe religious organization, § 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA, is a reference to the practice of the\n\nHutterites living communally on their own property and providing services off their\n\nproperty.\n\n¶91    Some of these provisions could be potentially innocuous methods of defining a\n\nreligious entity for incorporation within the workers’ compensation system as part of a broad\n\ninclusion of all religious organizations within the system. However, the Legislature did not\n\n\n\ntext of HB 119, the Act as a whole, and the legislative history, which reveal an effort of laser-like\nprecision to capture only the Hutterites.\n                                                 39\n\fbroadly incorporate all religions. Rather, it enacted these provisions to define and target only\n\nthe Hutterite religion for inclusion within the system. While the text of HB 119 is not\n\nfacially discriminatory, its history and text reveal that it nonetheless fails to be neutral and\n\ngenerally applicable. “Official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment\n\ncannot be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 534, 113 S. Ct. at 2227. The effect of HB 119 is to create a religious\n\ngerrymander that improperly singles out one religion. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 535, 113\n\nS. Ct. at 2228 (“Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence\n\nof its object.”). The significance of a religious gerrymander under the proper legal analysis\n\nis that it must sustain strict scrutiny review. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 531-32, 113 S. Ct.\n\nat 2226.\n\n¶92    The Court relies on cases that rejected Free Exercise challenges to truly generally\n\napplicable statutes. Generally applicable laws are not subject to strict scrutiny review and\n\nthus are more easily defended against challenges. In Alamo Foundation and Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries, religious organizations challenged labor and tax laws that were\n\ngenerally applicable to the commercial activities of all organizations, including religious\n\norganizations. Similarly, South Ridge Baptist Church, Lee, and Rogue Valley Youth for\n\nChrist challenged generally applicable tax and wage requirements. In these cases, the\n\nreligious organizations merely argued that compliance with such neutral and generally\n\napplicable requirements violated the tenets of their faith. Unlike HB 119, there was no effort\n\nin those cases to draft the challenged laws with the purpose to gerrymander and include a\n\n\n\n                                               40\n\fparticular religious organization within the system. The failure to draft HB 119 in a\n\ngenerally applicable manner necessarily requires strict scrutiny review.\n\n¶93    That being so, the State argues that a compelling state interest can be demonstrated. It\n\noffers that HB 119 was enacted for two legitimate government interests, including protection\n\nof the Uninsured Employers’ Fund (UEF) from potential liability for a catastrophic injury\n\nclaim filed by a Hutterite member and ensuring fair competition among businesses by\n\neliminating the Hutterites’ perceived advantage. Regarding the first, the UEF only applies to\n\nuninsured “employers” who are subject to the Act but have not provided coverage for their\n\nemployees. See Zempel v. Uninsured Employers’ Fund, 282 Mont. 424, 431, 938 P.2d 658,\n\n663 (1997) (citations omitted) (“[O]nly injured employees of employers meeting the\n\ndefinition of uninsured employer . . . are entitled to the ‘substitute’ workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits the UEF was created to provide to injured employees of employers who have failed\n\nto ‘properly comply’ with the Act. . . . As a result, the UEF has no funding mechanism to\n\nprovide ‘substitute’ workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees of employers not\n\nsubject to the Act.”). Consequently, prior to HB 119, a claim could not have been filed by a\n\nHutterite member against the UEF because the Colony was not an “employer” subject to the\n\nAct—and none have been filed. The State is attempting to legitimize HB 119 by arguing\n\nthat the bill provides a solution to a problem that did not exist prior to the bill’s enactment.\n\nAdditionally, even if the UEF was a legitimate government concern, HB 119 does not further\n\nthat concern. As noted by the District Court, a fundamental tenet of the Hutterites’ faith is\n\nthat they cannot make legal claims against others. The Hutterite faith includes “the\n\ncommandment to . . . not to seek redress before secular authorities whether related to secular\n                                              41\n\for sectarian issues.” A governmental interest in protecting the UEF from claims that are\n\nprohibited as a matter of law, made by people whose faith forbids them to make such claims,\n\ncan hardly be considered “legitimate.”\n\n¶94    The State’s second argument that HB 119 was enacted for a legitimate government\n\npurpose pertained to complaints from businesses about unequal competition with the\n\ncolonies. We recognize that the State has legitimate interests in the financial viability of the\n\nworkers’ compensation system, in controlling costs, and in providing benefits.                  See\n\nStratemeyer v. Lincoln Co., 259 Mont. 147, 155, 855 P.2d 506, 511 (1993); Eastman v.\n\nAtlantic Richfield Co., 237 Mont. 332, 339, 777 P.2d 862, 866 (1989). However, the State\n\nhas provided no authority for the proposition that ensuring “competitive fairness” among the\n\nstate’s businesses is an objective of the workers’ compensation system. Rather, the workers’\n\ncompensation system is directed to providing care and rehabilitation to injured workers and\n\nreturning them to work as soon as possible. Caldwell v. MACo Workers’ Comp. Trust, 2011\n\nMT 162, ¶ 31, 361 Mont. 140, 256 P.3d 923. Further, the State has not made an effort to\n\ndemonstrate that requiring the Colony to pay for workers’ compensation coverage would\n\nactually address the concern over unfair competition, where any competitive advantage of\n\nthe Colony would appear to be primarily because of its nonpayment of the more substantial\n\nexpenses of wages and benefits, unique to the Colony’s religious beliefs. The State argues\n\nthat fairness “is a viable legislative goal, and the Legislature is entitled to take steps to ensure\n\nthat the workers’ compensation system is fair to all participants, whether religious or\n\nsecular.” However, whether or not “fairness” among competing businesses is a viable goal\n\nof the workers’ compensation system, it pales in comparison to “one of the most cherished\n                                                42\n\fand protected liberties in our society,” St. John’s Lutheran Church, 252 Mont. at 523, 830\n\nP.2d at 1276, and cannot be accomplished by legislation that targets a particular religious\n\ngroup and intrudes upon their internal religious practices. The State’s interest in insuring a\n\nviable workers’ compensation system or creating a “level playing field” is not legitimized by\n\nHB 119 in a way that satisfies the rigorous standards protecting the free exercise of religion.\n\n¶95    The State argues there is a compelling state interest because workers’ compensation,\n\nlike social security, “serves the public interest by providing a comprehensive insurance\n\nsystem with a variety of benefits available to all participants . . .” (quoting Lee, 455 U.S. at\n\n258, 102 S. Ct. at 1055), and this interest is advanced by HB 119’s intention to correct the\n\npurported unfair competitive advantage the Colony has over other businesses. However, HB\n\n119 fails to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endangers the State’s purported government\n\ninterests of preventing a catastrophic claim against the UEF and address the perceived\n\nbusiness advantage enjoyed by the Hutterites by not participating in the workers’\n\ncompensation system. The Workers’ Compensation Act currently exempts other areas of\n\nemployment in agriculture, manufacturing, and construction that could affect the UEF or the\n\nviability of the workers’ compensation system. For example, § 39-71-401(2), MCA,\n\nexempts certain employments from the Act, unless the employer elects coverage and the\n\ninsurer allows coverage, including: household or domestic employment (§ 39-71-401(2)(a)),\n\ncasual employment (§ 39-71-401(2)(b)), employment of a person performing services in\n\nreturn for aid or sustenance only (§ 39-71-401(2)(h)), a person who is employed by an\n\nenrolled tribal member or an association, business, corporation, or other entity that is at least\n\n51% owned by an enrolled tribal member or members, whose business is conducted solely\n                                               43\n\fwithin the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation (§ 39-71-401(2)(m)), and a person\n\nwho is an officer or manager of a ditch company (§ 39-71-401(2)(s)).4                 Similarly,\n\nindependent contractors may waive rights and benefits of the Act if they obtain an\n\nindependent contractor exemption (§ 39-71-401(3)). These exemptions are contrary to the\n\ngovernmental interests asserted by the State, and lend further credence that the Legislature’s\n\nintent, as demonstrated above, was to pursue “governmental interests only against conduct\n\nmotivated by religious belief.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 545, 113 S. Ct. at 2233.\n\n¶96    HB 119 is likewise not narrowly tailored and it places an impermissible burden on the\n\nHutterite religion. A law is narrowly tailored when the law achieves its stated ends without\n\nunduly burdening religion. See Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 546, 113 S. Ct. at 2234; Yoder,\n\n406 U.S. at 220-21, 92 S. Ct. at 1536. Following the United States Supreme Court, this\n\nCourt has previously applied the Thomas test to determine whether there is a burden on the\n\nfree exercise of religion:\n\n              Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct\n       proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of\n       conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on\n       an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon\n       religion exists.\n\nGriffith v. Butte Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2010 MT 246, ¶ 62, 358 Mont. 193, 244 P.3d 321 (quoting\n\nValley Christian Sch. v. Mont. High Sch. Ass’n, 2004 MT 41, ¶ 7, 320 Mont. 81, 86 P.3d\n\n554; Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Empl. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S. Ct. 1425,\n\n1432 (1981)). There is a burden on the free exercise of religion when the state causes an\n\n4\n This Court has periodically discussed these exemptions to the Act, see i.e., Weidow v. Uninsured\nEmployers’ Fund, 2010 MT 292, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d 704; Cottrill v. Cottrill Sodding Serv., 229\n\n                                               44\n\f“internal impact or infringement” on the relationship between a religious entity and its\n\nmembers or “on their sincerely held religious beliefs.” St. John’s Lutheran Church, 252\n\nMont. at 526, 830 P.2d at 1278. The United States Supreme Court’s 2012 Hosanna-Tabor\n\ndecision further supports the premise that there is an impermissible burden on the free\n\nexercise of religion when a government action causes an “internal impact” on religious\n\nbeliefs. Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church & Sch. v. Equal Empl. Opportunity\n\nComm’n, ___ U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 694 (2012).\n\n¶97    The State argues that the burden imposed by the workers’ compensation system on the\n\nHutterites is incidental. However, it fails to recognize that the operation of HB 119 and the\n\nAct interferes with the internal relationship between the Colony and its members under the\n\ncentral tenets of the Hutterite faith. The Hutterite faith prohibits all property ownership, but\n\nthe Act requires injured employees to initiate and thus “own” a claim against the employer or\n\nits insurer to receive benefits under the Act. See § 39-71-603, MCA. The State argues, and\n\nthe Court accepts, that self-insurance is a viable option for the Colony, under which a claim\n\nwould be made to the Colony itself without any determination of whether a member is\n\npossessing property. See Opinion, ¶ 63. However, the statute cited for this premise, § 39-\n\n71-2103, MCA, actually provides that after an employer is approved to be self-insured, the\n\nemployer may “make payments directly to the employees as they may become entitled to\n\nreceive the payments.” Such payments to Colony members are exactly the problem because\n\nthe Colony’s beliefs require members to relinquish property and live communally.\n\n\n\n\nMont. 40, 744 P.2d 895 (1987); Bennett v. Bennett, 196 Mont. 22, 637 P.2d 512 (1981).\n                                              45\n\f¶98    Further, in the event a member would file a workers’ compensation claim against the\n\nColony, an act directly contrary to Hutterite religious principles, the member faces\n\nexcommunication from the Colony. The Court’s solution for this religious burden is that\n\n“nothing prevents an injured Colony member from refraining to file a workers’\n\ncompensation claim or returning any workers’ compensation claim award” or, alternatively,\n\nthe Colony could proceed “to excommunicate a member who receives compensation for lost\n\nwages and refuses to give the money to the Colony.” Opinion, ¶ 68. The Court thus reasons\n\nthat the Hutterites could simply forego participation in the system to comply with its\n\nreligious beliefs. Yet, the financial burden would remain, for which no benefit would be\n\npaid. This is the very definition of illusory coverage that “defies logic” and violates public\n\npolicy. See Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., 2003 MT 85, ¶ 37, 315 Mont. 107, 67\n\nP.3d 892. The Court also reasons that the burden placed upon the Colony could be addressed\n\nby a member violating his religious tenets and having the Colony excommunicate the\n\nmember. Opinion, ¶ 68. I would suggest that this is not a permissible rationale for justifying\n\nthe State’s internal impact upon a religion’s practices.\n\n¶99    I would thus reject the State’s argument that the burden imposed here is incidental.\n\nHB 119 creates a substantial burden on the Colony’s religious practice because, in order for\n\nthe Colony and its members to actually participate under the Act, they must violate their\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs.5 HB 119 creates substantial internal intrusion into the\n\nreligious practices of the Colony and its members, burdening the Hutterites’ religious\n\n\n5\n No question has been raised about the sincerity of the Colony’s religious beliefs. See i.e., Sherbert\nv. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 399 n. 1, 83 S. Ct. 1790, 1791 n. 1 (1963).\n                                                 46\n\fpractices. Strict scrutiny review is not satisfied because the law is neither justified by a\n\ncompelling state interest nor narrowly tailored to advance that interest.6\n\n¶100 In my view, the Court fails in its duty to properly undertake the necessary\n\nconstitutional inquiry. The Court’s over-general statements do not acknowledge the facts of\n\nthe record. The Court’s reliance on Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective\n\nAssociation, 485 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 1319 (1988), where the United States Supreme Court\n\nrejected a challenge to the government’s use of its own property for road construction and\n\nthe property was deemed sacred by non-owners, provides little authority for this case and\n\nless consolation. Our Court has held that “only those interests of the highest order and those\n\nnot otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.” St.\n\nJohn’s Lutheran Church, 252 Mont. at 524, 830 P.2d at 1276 (quoting Miller v. Catholic\n\nDiocese of Great Falls, Billings, 224 Mont. 113, 117, 728 P.2d 794, 796 (1986); Yoder, 406\n\nU.S. at 215, 92 S. Ct. at 1533). However, in my view, such protection has not been provided\n\nherein. Had this been the status of religious freedom in 1620, the Pilgrims may well have\n\nsailed right by.\n\n¶101 I dissent.\n\n                                                     /S/ JIM RICE\n\nJustice Patricia O. Cotter and Justice Jim Nelson join in the dissenting Opinion of Justice\nRice.\n\n\n\n6\n  The Court responds to the claim that HB 119 intrudes into the religious practices of the Colony by\nlisting regulatory statutes that would apply to the Colony’s business activities. See Opinion, ¶ 62.\nHowever, these statutes regulate the Hutterites’ external activities and do not intrude into their\ninternal religious practices, as do the provisions at issue here.\n                                                47\n\f     /S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n     /S/ JAMES C.

Wipf (collectively Colony). The\n\nDistrict Court determined that the requirement to provide workers’ compensation coverage\n\nfor the Colony’s members engaged in certain commercial activities contained in House Bill\n\n119 (2009 Mont. Laws, ch. 112 § 30) (HB 119) violated the Colony’s rights under the Free\n\nExercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S\n\nConstitution, and also violated the Colony’s right to equal protection of the laws under the\n\nU.S. Constitution and the Montana Constitution. We reverse.\n\n¶2     We address the following issues on appeal:\n\n¶3     1. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the definition of\n\n“employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under the Workers’\n\nCompensation Act violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n\n¶4     2. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the definition of\n\n“employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under the Workers’\n\nCompensation Act violate the Establishment Clause.\n\n¶5     3. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the definition of\n\n“employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under the Workers’\n\nCompensation Act violate the Colony’s right to equal protection of the laws.\n\n\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n                                             2\n\f¶6     The Hutterite Brethren Church originally formed in the 16th century as part of the\n\nAnabaptist movement during the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Anabaptists rejected\n\ninfant baptism as “unbiblical” and instead renewed the practice of adult baptism.\n\nAnabaptists live a life of pacifism. Jacob Hutter and his followers eventually broke away\n\nfrom other Anabaptists over a dispute regarding communal living.\n\n¶7     Jacob Hutter suffered a violent end as he was burned at the stake in a public square in\n\nInnsbruck, Austria, in 1536. Austro-Hungarian authorities held Hutter in freezing water and\n\nthen placed him in a hot room. Authorities further tortured Hutter by pouring brandy on his\n\nwounds before burning him to death.\n\n¶8     Hutterite believers moved across Europe for the next several centuries in search of a\n\nsafe place in which to practice their faith and live their communal life. This wandering\n\neventually brought the Hutterites to North America in the 19th century in search of religious\n\nfreedom. Hutterites continue to practice their faith and live a communal lifestyle in colonies\n\nin Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, and parts of Canada.\n\n¶9     The Colony, a signatory to the Hutterian Brethren Church Constitution, organizes\n\nitself as a religious corporation under Montana law. The Colony’s Articles of Incorporation\n\nprovide that it was formed for the purpose of operating “a Hutterische Church Brotherhood\n\nCommunity.” All members of the Colony must belong to the Hutterische Church Society\n\nand all members agree to “live a communal life and follow the teaching and tenets of the\n\nHutterische Church Society.” Daniel Wipf serves as the Colony’s first minister and\n\ncorporate president.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f¶10    The Department initially determined that the Workers’ Compensation Act did not\n\napply to the Colony or its members due to the fact that the Colony did not pay “wages” to its\n\nmembers. The Department based this determination on the fact that the Colony did not fall\n\nwithin the definition of “employer” set forth at § 39-71-117, MCA, and that the Colony’s\n\nmembers did not fall within the definition of “employee” set forth at § 39-71-118, MCA.\n\nThe 2009 Montana legislature enacted HB 119.\n\n¶11    HB 119 worked a laundry list of changes to the Workers’ Compensation Act,\n\nincluding revised claims handling practices (§ 39-71-107, MCA), and revised accident\n\nreporting requirements for employers (§ 39-71-307, MCA). Pertinent to our analysis,\n\nSection 6 amended the definition of “employer” to include:\n\n       a religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust receiving\n       remuneration from nonmembers for agricultural production, manufacturing, or\n       a construction project conducted by its members on or off the property of the\n       religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust.\n\n\nSection 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. Section 7 of HB 119 amended the definition of “employee”\n\nto include:\n\n       a member of a religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust\n       while performing services for the religious corporation, religious organization,\n       or religious trust, as described in 39-71-117(1)(d).\n\nSection 39-71-118(1)(i), MCA.\n\n¶12    The Colony brought an action against the Department in 2010. The Colony alleged\n\nthat Sections 6 and 7 of HB 119 impermissibly swept the Colony and its members within the\n\ndefinition of “employer” and “employee” in the Workers’ Compensation Act. The Colony\n\nand the Department agreed that the inclusion of the Colony within the definition of\n                                              4\n\f“employer” and the Colony’s members within the definition of “employee” would require\n\nthe Colony to provide workers’ compensation coverage for its members engaged in\n\ncommercial activities. The Colony alleged that this requirement to provide workers’\n\ncompensation coverage violated the Free Exercise Clause, the Establishment Clause, and the\n\nColony’s right to equal protection of the law.\n\n¶13    The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court first\n\naddressed the Colony’s Free Exercise claim. The court determined that Sections 6 and 7\n\nwere not neutral as the burdens posed “fall only on the Hutterite religion.” The court further\n\ndetermined that Sections 6 and 7 were not generally applicable as the bill “unquestionably\n\ntargets only the Hutterite religious practice of communal living.” The two determinations\n\nprompted the court to apply strict scrutiny. The court’s strict scrutiny analysis led it to reject\n\nthe Department’s claim of any compelling state interest being served by Sections 6 and 7.\n\n¶14    With respect to the Colony’s Establishment Clause claim, the court purported to apply\n\nthe test from Lemon v. Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). Sections 6 and 7\n\nfoundered on every factor of the Lemon Test. The court concluded that Sections 6 and 7\n\nimpermissibly “targeted a group defined by their religion.” The primary effect of this\n\nimpermissible targeting, in turn, “would be to inhibit the Colony in the practice of their\n\nreligion.” Finally, the court concluded that excessive entanglement with the State would\n\nensue as it “appears evident that a comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state\n\nsurveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that only particular areas of Hutterite\n\nactivities are scrutinized.”\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\f¶15    The court also determined that Sections 6 and 7 violated the Colony’s right to equal\n\nprotection of the laws. These provisions, according to the court, specifically identify\n\n“religious organizations” and target a particular religious organization. The separate\n\nclassification created by Sections 6 and 7 “treats Hutterites differently from other religious\n\norganizations and further targets religious organizations generally.” This classification,\n\naccording to the District Court, failed to satisfy even the rational basis standard that applies\n\nto constitutional challenges to workers’ compensation laws. The Department appeals.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶16    This Court exercises plenary review of constitutional issues. DeVoe v.

The Court in Lukumi Babalu\n\nstruck down a group of municipal ordinances that banned animal sacrifice.\n\n¶19     The Santeria church intended to construct a church in the City of Hialeah. Animal\n\nsacrifice represents one of the principal forms of devotion of the Santeria church. Church\n\nmembers perform animal sacrifices “at birth, marriage, and death rites, for the cure of the\n\nsick, for the initiation of new members and priests, and during annual celebrations.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 524, 113 S. Ct. at 2222. The City of Hialeah enacted four ordinances\n\nimmediately after the Santeria church announced its plans to construct a church there.\n\n¶20     The Court recognized that the ordinances, though seemingly neutral on their faces,\n\neffectively served to ban animal sacrifices undertaken for religious reasons. The Court\n\nlikened the religious discrimination effect of the ordinances to an impermissible state law\n\nthat disqualified members of the clergy from holding certain public offices in McDaniel v.\n\nPaty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109831\"><a href=\"/opinion/109831/mcdaniel-v-paty/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109831\"><a href=\"/opinion/109831/mcdaniel-v-paty/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There the city\n\nhad interpreted a municipal ordinance to prohibit preaching in a public park by a Jehovah’s\n\nWitness, but to allow preaching during the course of a Catholic Mass or a Protestant church\n\nservice. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226, citing Fowler, 345 U.S. at 69-\n\n70, 73 S. Ct. at 527. The Court in Lukumi Babalu concluded that the religious exercise of the\n\nSanteria church represented “the only conduct” subject to the prohibition on animal sacrifice.\n\nLukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 535, 113 S. Ct. at 2228.\n                                              7\n\f¶21    The requirement that a religious corporation provide workers’ compensation coverage\n\nfor its members differs markedly from the outright ban of an activity central to the Santeria\n\nfaith. Unlike the prohibitions in Lukumi Babalu and McDaniel, the workers’ compensation\n\nrequirement does not prohibit the Colony members from engaging in the commercial\n\nactivity. HB 119 regulates the Colony’s engagement in commercial activities in the same\n\nmanner that the workers’ compensation system regulates the commercial activities of other\n\nemployers in Montana. The Colony, like all other employers in Montana, simply will make\n\nless money on these commercial endeavors once it pays the workers’ compensation\n\npremiums. And unlike the ordinance in Fowler, the workers’ compensation requirement\n\ndoes not place the Colony members in a discriminatory position compared to other religious\n\ngroups who might choose to engage in similar activity. These distinctions lead us to reject\n\nthe strict scrutiny analysis from Lukumi Babalu as the appropriate lens through which to\n\nanalyze the Colony’s claim.\n\n¶22    We instead apply the standard used by the Court in Dept. of Human Resources of\n\nOregon v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The workers’\n\ncompensation requirement must be facially neutral and serve a secular purpose in order to\n\nsurvive a Free Exercise challenge. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1599. The\n\nrequirement also must impose only an incidental burden on religious conduct as opposed to a\n\nprohibition on religious conduct. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1599.\n\n       Facially Neutral and Secular Purpose.\n\n¶23    The District Court concluded that HB 119 “unquestionably targets only the Hutterite\n\nreligious practice of communal living.” This conclusion ignores the fact that the workers’\n                                             8\n\fcompensation requirement in Montana applies generally to multiple types of entities. See\n\n§ 39-71-117, MCA. The legislature did not conceive of the workers’ compensation system\n\nas a means to shackle the religious practices of Colony members. HB 119 simply adds to the\n\nscope of the workers’ compensation system religious corporations that engage in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration through its expansion of the definition of\n\n“employer” contained in § 39-71-117, MCA.\n\n¶24    No doubt exists that the workers’ compensation requirement would apply if the\n\nColony employed its members to work for wages on these commercial activities. Indeed, in\n\nSt. John’s Lutheran Church v. State Comp. Ins. Fund, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"882613\"><a href=\"/opinion/882613/st-johns-lutheran-v-state-comp-ins-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1277 (1992), this Court rejected a Free Exercise challenge to the requirement that the church\n\nprovide workers’ compensation coverage to its pastor on the basis that the provision of\n\nworkers’ compensation represents “an overriding governmental interest.” No doubt exists\n\nthat the workers’ compensation requirement would apply if the Colony opted to establish\n\nseparate commercial entities to perform the type of work at issue here. See Ridley Park\n\nMethodist Church v. Zoning Hearing Board, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">953</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 960 (Pa. 2007) (denying zoning\n\nvariance to operate a daycare on church site did not impinge on religious activities of church\n\nas operation of the daycare “is not a fundamental religious activity of a church”).\n\n¶25    The Dissent suggests that HB 119 would not capture the activities of the other\n\nreligious employers, in part, because they do not engage in the types of economic activities\n\nenumerated by HB 119. Dissent, ¶ 88. HB 119 did not need to capture these other religious\n\nemployers, however, to incorporate them into the workers’ compensation system. Section\n\n39-71-117(1)(a), MCA, already captures other religious employers who engage in\n                                              9\n\fcommercial activities. Subsection (a) includes within the definition of “employer” “all\n\npublic corporations and quasi-public corporations,” religious or otherwise. Subsection (a)\n\nfurther includes within the definition of “employer” “each firm, voluntary association,\n\nlimited liability company, limited liability partnership, and private corporation,” religious or\n\notherwise. Finally, subsection (c) defines employer to include “any non-profit association,\n\nlimited liability company, limited liability partnership, or corporation or other entity,”\n\nreligious or otherwise, that receives federal, state, or local government funds to be used for\n\ncommunity service programs.\n\n¶26    The Department of Labor and Industry previously did not consider the Colony subject\n\nto the workers’ compensation system due to the fact that the Colony did not pay “wages” to\n\nits members as part of its communal living system. The Colony nevertheless engaged in\n\ncommercial activities. The Colony instead provides food, shelter, clothing, and medical care\n\nto its members who engage in these commercial activities. See Stahl v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"179975\"><a href=\"/opinion/179975/stahl-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521 (9th Cir. 2010). HB 119 clarified that religious corporations, organizations, or\n\ntrusts that engage in specified commercial activities, who do not pay “wages” to their\n\nmembers for labor on these commercial activities, but who receive remuneration from\n\nnonmembers, qualify as “employers” for purposes of the workers’ compensation system.\n\nSection 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. HB 119 does not lose its facial neutrality or shed its secular\n\npurpose due to the fact that it sought to include the colony’s commercial activities, as\n\nopposed to its religious practices, within the scope of the workers’ compensation system.\n\n       Incidental Burden or Prohibition on Religious Conduct.\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\f¶27    The District Court pronounced that the communal lifestyle represents the Hutterites’\n\n“most distinguishing feature.” This communal lifestyle merges religious exercise and labor\n\nas a member voluntarily contributes all of his property and labor to the Colony “as an\n\nexpression of faith and worship.” This attribute led the District Court to determine that\n\napplication of HB 119 to the Colony’s commercial activities transformed a potentially valid\n\nregulation into an outright prohibition on religious conduct. Courts uniformly have rejected\n\nthe notion that a party’s religious motivation for undertaking an act can transform a generally\n\napplicable regulation into a prohibition on religious conduct. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S.\n\nCt. at 1600. Other courts have recognized that this logic, taken to its extreme, would\n\nsubsume every facet of a religious organization into a religious activity.\n\n¶28    The Court in Smith dismissed the notion that the “religious motivation” for using\n\npeyote placed the two employees beyond the reach of a criminal law not directed specifically\n\nat their religious practice. Smith, 494 U.S. at 878, 110 S. Ct. at 1600. Alfred Smith and\n\nGalen Black were fired from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation organization\n\nbecause they ingested peyote for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Native American\n\nChurch, of which both were members. The employment division denied their claims for\n\nunemployment due to the fact that they had been discharged for work-related “misconduct.”\n\nSmith, 494 U.S. at 874, 110 S. Ct. at 1598. The two brought a Free Exercise challenge to the\n\ndivision’s denial.\n\n¶29    The Court recognized, similar to the Colony’s claim, that the exercise of religion often\n\ninvolves not only belief, “but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts.” Smith,\n\n494 U.S. at 877, 110 S. Ct. at 1599. These acts include “assembling with others for a\n                                              11\n\fworship service, participating in sacramental use of bread and wine, proselytizing, abstaining\n\nfrom certain foods or certain modes of transportation.” Smith, 494 U.S. at 877, 110 S. Ct. at\n\n1599. The Court noted, in an obvious foreshadowing of its decision in Lukumi Babalu, that\n\nit likely would be unconstitutional if a state attempted to ban such acts or abstentions only\n\nwhen a person engages in them for religious reasons. Smith, 494 U.S. at 877-78, 110 S. Ct.\n\nat 1599.\n\n¶30    The Court upheld the denial of benefits based largely upon the fact that peyote use\n\nhad not been prohibited for religious reasons. The “right of free exercise does not relieve an\n\nindividual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid and neutral law of general applicability\n\non the grounds that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or\n\nproscribes).’” Smith, 494 U.S. at 879, 110 S.

The Foundation argued that it staffed its numerous commercial operations,\n\nincluding service stations, retail clothing and grocery outlets, hog farms, roofing and\n\nelectrical construction companies, a recordkeeping company, a motel, and companies\n\nengaged in the production and distribution of candy, entirely with volunteers, known as\n\n“associates.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 292, 105 S. Ct. at 1957.\n\n¶32    These associates typically had been “drug addicts, derelicts, or criminals” before their\n\nconversion and rehabilitation by the Foundation. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 292, 105 S.\n\nCt. at 1957. The associates received no cash salaries. The Foundation instead provided them\n\nwith food, clothing, shelter, and other benefits. The Secretary of Labor initiated an action\n\nagainst the Foundation based upon the notion that the Foundation was “engaged in ordinary\n\ncommercial activities in competition with other commercial businesses.” Alamo Foundation,\n\n471 U.S. at 293, 105 S. Ct. at 1957. As a result, the Secretary argued that the “economic\n\nreality” test of employment demonstrated that the associates qualified as employees.\n\n¶33    The Court examined the Foundation’s claim that the associates functioned as\n\n“volunteers” without any expectation of compensation. In fact, one associate testified\n\nconvincingly that “no one ever expected any kind of compensation, and the thought is totally\n\nvexing to my soul.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 301, 105 S. Ct. at 1961. Despite the\n\nheart-felt protests of this associate and others, application of the “economic reality” test\n\nrevealed that the associates expected, indeed relied upon, the benefits conferred by the\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\fFoundation in the form of food, clothing, and shelter. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 301,\n\n105 S. Ct. at 1961.\n\n¶34    The Court further rejected the Foundation’s claim that application of the generally\n\napplicable minimum wage and recordkeeping requirements failed to rise to the level of a\n\nprohibition on religious conduct. The Court reasoned that the FLSA does not require the\n\npayment of “cash wages.” Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 303-04, 105 S. Ct. at 1963. The\n\nFLSA defines wages to include many of the same benefits that the associates received.

This merchandise contained specific religious content –\n\nBibles, Bible study materials, printed sermons and collections of sermons, audiocassette\n\ntapes of sermons, religious books and pamphlets, and religious music in the form of song-\n\nbooks, tapes, and records. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 383, 110 S.

The Court rejected the claim that the sales\n\nand use tax constituted a tax “on the right to disseminate religious information, ideas, or\n\nbeliefs.” The Court instead characterized the sales and use tax as a tax “on the privilege of\n\nmaking retail sales of tangible personal property” in California. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries,\n\n493 U.S. at 389, 110 S. Ct. at 696.

See Indianapolis Baptist Temple, 224 F.2d at 629 (describing federal\n\nunemployment tax laws as laws of “general” application). In the present case, the District\n\nCourt rejected the notion that Sections 6 and 7 were generally applicable laws based on its\n\ndetermination that the “object of the legislation was remote from the concerns and purpose\n\nunderlying the Workers’ Compensation Act.” The District Court instead viewed HB 119 as\n\n“an attempt to ‘tax’ the Hutterites for a religious practice.”\n\n¶40    The Court in United States v.

The Court noted that Congress had sought to accommodate, to the extent\n\ncompatible with a comprehensive national program, the practices of those who believe it a\n                                              16\n\fviolation of their faith to participate in the social security system. Lee, 455 U.S. at 260, 102\n\nS. Ct. at 1057. The Court cited the exemptions on religious grounds for self-employed\n\nAmish as an example of the efforts by Congress to accommodate religious beliefs. Lee, 455\n\nU.S. at 260, 102 S. Ct. at 1057. The Court further recognized, however, that when\n\n“followers of a particular [religious] sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,\n\nthe limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\n\nsuperimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.” Lee,\n\n455 U.S. at 261, 102 S. Ct. at 1057.\n\n¶41    The legislature’s regulation of the activities of Colony members would violate the\n\nright of members to exercise freely their religion only when the regulation impermissibly\n\nsingles out “some or all religious beliefs or regulates or prohibits conduct because it is\n\nundertaken for religious reasons.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226. The\n\nworkers’ compensation system in Montana generally applies to all employers engaged in\n\ncommercial activities. Section 39-71-401, MCA. The inclusion of religious organizations\n\nthat engage voluntarily in commercial activities within the workers’ compensation system\n\ndoes not single out religious beliefs. Lee, 455 U.S. at 261, 102 S. Ct. at 1057. And neither\n\ndoes HB 119’s inclusion of religious organizations within the workers’ compensation system\n\nregulate or prohibit any conduct “because it is undertaken for religious reasons.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 532, 113 S. Ct. at 2226.\n\n¶42    Courts routinely have rejected Free Exercise challenges to compelled participation by\n\nreligious organizations in a wide variety of social welfare programs. These programs range\n\nfrom a similar workers’ compensation system to the one at issue here, South Baptist Temple,\n                                               17\n\fto social security, Lee, to unemployment tax systems, Indianapolis Baptist Temple and\n\nValley Youth for Christ, to federal minimum wage and overtime and recordkeeping\n\nrequirements, Alamo Foundation, to state sales and use taxes, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.\n\nEach of these religious organizations presented sincere and heartfelt beliefs that its\n\nparticipation in the governmental program violated its religious beliefs. The courts rejected\n\neach claim. We, too, reject the Colony’s Free Exercise challenge to its participation in\n\nMontana’s workers’ compensation system for Colony members engaged in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration. The decision of the legislature to include in\n\nthe definition of “employer” religious corporations that voluntarily engage in commercial\n\nactivities with nonmembers for remuneration fails to establish evidence of discrimination\n\nagainst religious organizations.

The government conduct at issue must (1) have a secular\n\npurpose, (2) not have as its principal or primary effect inhibiting religion, and (3) not foster\n\nexcessive entanglement with religion. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S. Ct. at 2111. Courts\n\nmost commonly apply Lemon to situations in which the government allegedly has given\n\npreference to a religion. Roemer v.

This analysis led the court to\n\ndetermine that “the individual Hutterites” who work for the corporation should be seen “as\n\ncommon law employees” to the extent that these individual members perform the work of\n\nthe corporation. Stahl, 626 F.3d at 527. The court remanded for consideration of the\n\npresident’s claims for deductions.\n\n¶58    On remand, the district court granted the president’s claim for deduction. With\n\nrespect to food, the court reasoned that the corporation’s dairy farm operation required round\n\nthe clock supervision. These employees must be fed. Stahl v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1226</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231 (E.D. Wa. 2012). Likewise, the court concluded that the corporation had\n\nprovided food and medical care to the president in return for his labor.\n\n¶59    The court recognized that the corporation and its members had created a community\n\nthat functions largely without wages. Employee compensation in a wageless community\n\ntakes the form of housing, food, and medical care. The fact that the corporation and its\n\nmembers had chosen this wageless community for religious reasons proved “irrelevant” as\n\nlong as the items that the corporation claims as compensation – food and medical care – truly\n\nfunction as compensation in the community. Stahl, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 1231. Similar\n\nreasoning applied to medical expenses incurred by the corporation to purchase a health plan\n\nfor the president and the corporation’s members and payment for any uninsured charges.\n\nStahl, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 1232.\n                                             23\n\f¶60    The Court in Jimmy Swaggart Ministries noted that the organization possessed a\n\nsophisticated accounting staff and had the ability to segregate retail sales and donations for\n\npurposes of obtaining a federal income tax exemption on these donations. Thus, Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries easily could track the revenue generated by its retail sales. The Court\n\nfurther recognized that imposition of the tax involved a determination only of whether a sale\n\nhad taken place and required no determination of whether the materials sold were religious in\n\nnature. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, 493 U.S. at 396, 110 S. Ct. at 699. The fact that Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries placed a price on its merchandise relieved California of the need to\n\nundertake any independent valuation of any religious items. Jimmy Swaggart Ministries,\n\n493 U.S. at 396, 110 S. Ct. at 699; see also Hofer, ¶ 43 (concluding that an express trust\n\nexists between the Hutterite colony and its members and therefore the colony’s resources are\n\navailable to members when considering a member’s eligibility for the Family-Related\n\nMedicaid Program).\n\n¶61    The court in South Ridge Baptist similarly rejected an excessive entanglement claim.\n\nThe burden imposed by the requirement that the church provide workers’ compensation\n\ncoverage for its employees differed little from the church’s other involvements with the state.\n\nOhio law required the church’s payroll and wage expenditures to be open for inspection.\n\nThese payroll reports are sent every six months to employers to be completed and returned.\n\nThe church would be obligated to report job-related injuries or illnesses and report aggregate\n\nwages and the number of employees. None of this information delved into “the religious\n\nbeliefs of the clergy or the congregation.” South Ridge Baptist, 911 F.2d at 1210. Moreover,\n\nthe church undoubtedly remains “subject to a variety of state public welfare regulations,\n                                              24\n\ffrom the zoning, building and fire codes applicable to its place of worship . . . to federal\n\nminimum wage and other labor standards governing [its] employment practices.” South\n\nRidge Baptist, 911 F.2d at 1211.\n\n¶62    The Dissent laments that HB 119 creates a substantial intrusion into the religious\n\npractices of the Colony and its members. Dissent, ¶ 99. Neither the Dissent, nor the Colony\n\nfor that matter, claim that other state regulations of the Colony’s commercial activities pose\n\nsubstantial intrusions into the religious practices of the Colony and its members. For\n\nexample, Title 81 of the Montana Code Annotated regulates commercial agricultural\n\nproducers of poultry, dairy, and other products. Title 81 further authorizes the Department\n\nof Agriculture and county boards of health to promulgate health and safety regulations for\n\ncommercial agricultural producers. These regulations necessarily require some entanglement\n\nbetween the State and producers of commercial agricultural products, including the Colony.\n\n¶63    The information necessary for the Colony to comply with participation in the\n\nworkers’ compensation system would not delve into the religious beliefs of the Colony or its\n\nmembers. It further appears that the requirement to provide workers’ compensation coverage\n\nfor its members engaged in commercial activities poses no more burdensome recordkeeping\n\nrequirement than those outlined in Stahl. The Colony presently maintains financial records\n\nbased on its status as a religious corporation so that its members, similar to the religious\n\ncorporation in Stahl, may file tax returns. Finally, as the Department asserts, the Colony\n\nretains the option to self-insure as a means to limit excessive entanglement. Section 39-71-\n\n2101, MCA. We cannot agree with the District Court’s conclusion that “a comprehensive,\n\ndiscriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that\n                                             25\n\fonly particular areas of Hutterite activity are scrutinized.” The recordkeeping required to\n\nestablish compliance with Montana’s workers’ compensation system constitutes a valid\n\nregulation of the Colony’s commercial activities.\n\n¶64    Issue 3. Whether the provisions in HB 119 that incorporate the Colony into the\n\ndefinition of “employer” and the Colony’s members into the definition of “employee” under\n\nthe Workers’ Compensation Act violate the Colony’s right to equal protection of the laws.\n\n¶65    The District Court determined that the separate classification created by Sections 6\n\nand 7 “treats Hutterites differently from other religious organizations and further targets\n\nreligious organizations generally.” A party who asserts an equal protection claim based on a\n\nworkers’ compensation statute must satisfy two separate criteria. Wilkes v. Mont. State\n\nFund, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888626\"><a href=\"/opinion/888626/wilkes-v-montana-state-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 12, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"888626\"><a href=\"/opinion/888626/wilkes-v-montana-state-fund/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The party first must demonstrate\n\nthat the legislature has created a classification that treats differently two or more similarly\n\nsituated groups. Wilkes, ¶ 12. Once the party has demonstrated a classification that treats\n\ngroups differently, the party must demonstrate that the discriminatory classification\n\nrationally relates to no legitimate governmental purpose. Wilkes, ¶ 12.\n\n¶66    The Colony claims that HB 119 singles out the Hutterites and treats them differently\n\nthan other similarly situated groups. The Colony identifies two separate sets of “similarly\n\nsituated groups.” The Colony first argues that HB 119 treats the Colony differently than any\n\nother religious groups. The Colony further argues that HB 119 treats religious groups\n\ndifferently from non-religious groups.\n\n¶67    The Colony argues that its commitment to communal living prevents a member from\n\nowning property. As a result, a Colony member who received any compensation for lost\n                                              26\n\fwages pursuant to a workers’ compensation claim immediately would have to forfeit the\n\nmoney to the Colony or face possible excommunication from the Colony. The Colony\n\nclaims, however, that HB 119 somehow would prevent the Colony from proceeding to\n\nexcommunicate a member who received a workers’ compensation claim payment. The\n\nColony further claims that no other religion bans ownership of property, and, therefore, HB\n\n119 would affect only the Colony in this manner.\n\n¶68    We first note that nothing prevents an injured Colony member from refraining to file a\n\nworkers’ compensation claim or returning any workers’ compensation claim award to the\n\nColony. Cf. Alamo Foundation, 471 U.S. at 304, 105 S. Ct. at 1963. More importantly,\n\nnothing in HB 119 or any other provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act prevents the\n\nColony from proceeding to excommunicate a member who receives compensation for lost\n\nwages and refuses to give the money to the Colony. HB 119 treats the Colony no differently\n\nthan any religious groups that do not prevent ownership of property.\n\n¶69    The Colony next argues that HB 119 creates a group of religious employers and a\n\ngroup of all other employers. HB 119 amended the definition of “employer” explicitly to\n\ninclude religious corporations, organizations, or trusts that engage in commercial activities\n\nwith nonmembers for remuneration. The Colony claims that the exclusive focus in Section 6\n\nof HB 119 on religious employers results in a system that treats religious employers\n\ndifferently than non-religious employers.\n\n¶70    We look to a statute’s plain language to interpret it. Delaney & Co. v.

Accordingly, we look to the entirety of the Workers’ Compensation Act, rather than to\n\na single subsection, to determine whether the Workers’ Compensation Act treats religious\n\nemployers differently than non-religious employers.\n\n¶71    Section 39-71-117, MCA, sets forth in mind-numbing detail the full definition of\n\n“employer” for purposes of the workers’ compensation system. This extensive definition,\n\nincluding subsections (a), (b), and (c), all of which predated HB 119, applies generally to\n\nreligious and non-religious entities alike. The definition of “employer” includes the state,\n\ncounties, cities, public corporations, quasi-public corporations, private corporations,\n\nindividual people, associations, limited liability companies, and nonprofit associations, as\n\nwell as numerous other entities. Section 39-71-117(a), (b), and (c), MCA. HB 119 simply\n\nadds religious organizations to the types of entities that qualify as an “employer” for\n\npurposes of the workers’ compensation system. HB 119 treats religious organizations no\n\ndifferently than any other employer under the workers’ compensation system. A review of\n\nthe complete list of entities that qualify as an “employer” for purposes of the workers’\n\ncompensation system reveals that the Workers’ Compensation Act creates no separate\n\nclassification under HB 119 that singles out religious groups for different treatment.\n\n¶72    The Colony’s failure to establish that HB 119 creates “two separate similarly situated\n\ngroups” that receive unequal treatment under the Workers’ Compensation Act ends our\n\ninquiry. This failure to establish two separate groups relieves the Court of the need to\n\nevaluate whether the alleged disparate treatment rationally relates to any legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest.

Justice O’Connor, in rejecting a challenge\n\nbrought by Native Americans to enjoin a United States forest service road through sacred\n\nareas, summed up our dilemma:\n\n      However much we might wish that it were otherwise, government simply\n      could not operate if it were required to satisfy every citizen’s religious needs\n      and desires. A broad range of government activities -- from social welfare\n      programs to foreign aid to conservation projects -- will always be considered\n      essential to the spiritual well-being of some citizens, often on the basis of\n      sincerely held religious beliefs. Others will find the very same activities\n      deeply offensive, and perhaps incompatible with their own search for spiritual\n      fulfillment and with the tenets of their religion. The First Amendment must\n      apply to all citizens alike, and it can give to none of them a veto over public\n      programs that do not prohibit the free exercise of religion. The Constitution\n      does not, and courts cannot, offer to reconcile the various competing demands\n      on government, many of them rooted in sincere religious belief, that inevitably\n      arise in so diverse a society as ours. That task, to the extent that it is feasible,\n      is for the legislatures and other institutions.\n\n\n\nLyng v.

To that end, the First Amendment and Article II, Section 5 of\n\nMontana’s Constitution both contain clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal proscriptions:\n\nCongress and the State shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\n\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof.\n\n¶77    Yet here, as Justice Rice explains, in order to level some theoretical economic playing\n\nfield and to pacify the complaints of one industry, the Legislature enacted a law targeting\n\nHutterite colonies and preventing them from being able to practice and comport with\n\nimportant doctrines of their religion—a religion that defines and drives every aspect of\n\nColony life.\n\n¶78    Today’s decision allows the State to do exactly what the Montana and United States\n\nConstitutions expressly prohibit. This Court’s decision allows the government to interfere\n\nwith the doctrinal belief systems of a religious institution and its members. Apparently,\n\nhenceforth, “no law” prohibiting the free exercise of religion does not actually mean “no\n\nlaw” in Montana. Rather, it means no law, except to the extent that the law greases the\n\nsqueaky wheel of a powerful industry.\n\n                                             30\n\f¶79    I dissent.\n\n                                                   /S/ JAMES C. NELSON\n\n\n\nJustice Jim Rice, dissenting.\n\n¶80    To reach its decision, the Court uses waves of generic statements that fail to account\n\nfor the facts of this case, the arguments of the Colony, and the applicable legal tests. The\n\nCourt makes no effort to determine whether the challenged legislation constitutes a religious\n\ngerrymander, even though courts “must survey meticulously the circumstances of\n\ngovernmental categories to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders.” Lukumi Babalu,\n\n508 U.S. at 534, 113 S. Ct. at 2227. The Court minimizes the Colony’s claim to merely\n\n“sincere and heartfelt beliefs that its participation in the governmental program violated its\n\nreligious beliefs,” and cites to numerous cases that reject claims of that nature, while failing\n\nto acknowledge that this case is factually, and fundamentally, different. Opinion, ¶ 42. I\n\nbelieve the facts and law, when properly considered, demonstrate that the Legislature created\n\na clear religious gerrymander applicable only to the Hutterites and that such action was not\n\njustified by a compelling state interest. I would affirm the District Court’s holding that their\n\nright to free exercise of religion was violated.\n\n¶81    A law affecting the constitutional guarantee of free exercise of religion is to be both\n\nfacially neutral and generally applicable. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 531-32, 113 S. Ct. at\n\n2226 (citing Smith, 494 U.S. at 879-81, 110 S. Ct. at 1600-01). A law failing to satisfy the\n\nrequirements of neutrality and general applicability “must be justified by a compelling\n\ngovernmental interest and must be narrowly tailored to advance that interest.” Lukumi\n                                              31\n\fBabalu, 508 U.S. at 531-32, 113 S. Ct. at 2226. A law is not neutral if the text of the law has\n\na targeting effect or a discriminatory object as discerned from direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 533-34, 113 S. Ct. at 2227. The Court in Lukumi\n\nBabalu stated:\n\n       Official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment cannot be\n       shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality. The\n       Free Exercise Clause protects against governmental hostility which is masked\n       as well as overt. ‘The Court must survey meticulously the circumstances of\n       governmental categories to eliminate, as it were, religious gerrymanders.’\n\nLukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 534, 113 S.

In\n\ndetermining that the contested ordinances in Lukumi Babalu were not neutral, the Court\n\nreviewed the legislative record and history surrounding the enactment of the ordinances,\n\nstating, “the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence of its object.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 535, 113 S. Ct. at 2228. The Court found that the four contested\n\nordinances created an impermissible religious gerrymander because they “were drafted in\n\ntandem” to “target petitioners and their religious practices.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at\n\n535, 113 S. Ct. at 2228.\n\n¶82    To appreciate the Hutterites’ arguments, it is first necessary to understand their unique\n\nreligious principles. The Court offers generally that the Hutterite faith is one in which “all\n\nmembers agree to live a communal life and follow the teaching and tenets of the Hutterische\n\nChurch Society,” Opinion, ¶ 9, but fails to discuss the manner in which the Hutterites were\n\ntargeted or articulate the critical tenets which the legislation would require the Hutterites to\n\nviolate in order to participate in the workers’ compensation system.\n\n                                              32\n\f¶83    To begin, the record establishes that a hallmark of the Hutterite religion is the\n\ncommunal lifestyle where religious exercise and labor are not divisible because “[a]ll labor\n\nand support provided by members to the Colony is done for their own personal religious\n\npurpose without promise or expectation of compensation. The performance of labor and\n\nsupport for the Colony is an act of religious exercise.” Hutterites eat meals, worship, work,\n\nand are educated entirely communally and they do not associate with “non-members.” The\n\nMembership Declaration, to which every member of the Colony must subscribe, affirms each\n\nmember’s responsibility to relinquish current and future property rights to the Colony, and\n\nmembers are not permitted a wage or salary. In fact, the Hutterite faith prohibits the\n\npayment of wages for labor performed by its members. At oral argument, the State conceded\n\nthat the wage replacement component of workers’ compensation coverage would not be\n\napplicable to Colony members because, pursuant to their tenets of faith, they cannot receive\n\nwages.1 Farming and agricultural production has been a part of the Hutterite lifestyle for\n\nhundreds of years and is specifically named in the Colony’s Articles of Incorporation and the\n\nHutterian Brethren Church Constitution as a central component of the Colony’s livelihood.\n\nThe Colony also participates in manufacturing and construction projects.\n\n¶84    In Wisconsin v.

As to medical care, the record reflects that “the colonies fund the medical care that their\n\n\n                                                 33\n\fafter completion of eighth grade in order to limit exposure to worldly influences inconsistent\n\nwith their religious beliefs. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 210-13, 92 S. Ct. at 1530-32. The Supreme\n\nCourt held that Wisconsin’s compulsory school attendance law unduly burdened the Free\n\nExercise Clause by forcing Amish parents to send their children to public school after the\n\neighth grade in violation of one of the core Amish religious beliefs. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 234-\n\n35, 92 S. Ct. at 1542. In its analysis, the Supreme Court stated that “we must be careful to\n\ndetermine whether the Amish religious faith and their mode of life, are . . . inseparable and\n\ninterdependent.” Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215, 92 S. Ct. at 1533. As in Yoder, the record here\n\nsupports the determination that the communal way of life of the Colony is “one of deep\n\nreligious conviction, shared by an organized group, and intimately related to daily living.”\n\nYoder, 406 U.S. at 216, 92 S. Ct. at 1533. The command to live communally and without\n\nproperty or legal claims is fundamental to the Hutterite faith.\n\n¶85    In addition to the communal lifestyle that requires renouncement of wages and the\n\nownership of property, and critical to an understanding of the conflict presented by their\n\ninclusion into the Workers’ Compensation Act, is the tenet that making a legal claim is a\n\nviolation of fundamental Hutterian doctrine. Daniel Wipf’s affidavit states that “Christians\n\nshall not sue one another at law nor sit in judgment of one another. Hutterites cannot make\n\nclaims against others for wrongs done to them.” The Membership Declaration, which every\n\nmember of the Colony must sign, states:\n\n              I declare that my acceptance of membership and the terms and\n       conditions of membership is a matter of my religious beliefs . . . Among those\n\nmembers need. Each individual Colony still provides full no-fault medical care for its members”\nand “[r]egardless of the reason for any member’s illness or injury, the member is cared for.”\n                                              34\n\f       beliefs is the commandment to live at peace with fellow believers, to resolve\n       disputes within the Church, and not to seek redress before secular authorities\n       whether related to secular or sectarian issues.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Wipf’s affidavit explains that a member who does not convey his or her\n\n“ownership” of a legal claim to the Colony, like other property, would be subject to\n\nexcommunication, or essentially termination from membership in the Colony. He states, “I\n\ndo not know of any Hutterite member who has made any workers’ compensation claim\n\nagainst a Hutterite colony in Montana or against the Uninsured Employers[’] Fund.”\n\n¶86    HB 119’s legislative history must be considered in order to understand the impact of\n\nthe bill. The United States Supreme Court has looked both to the text and to the legislative\n\nhistory of a law to determine whether legislators intended to target religious practices,\n\nLukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 533-34, 113 S. Ct. at 2227, although the Court fails to do so\n\nhere. The Department proposed HB 119 to address complaints received “about Hutterite\n\ncolonies competing with other Montana businesses, such as contractors, without having to\n\nprovide workers’ compensation insurance.”         The only religious group named in the\n\nlegislative debates surrounding HB 119 was the Hutterites, and both the House and the\n\nSenate specifically discussed the impact HB 119 would have on Hutterite colonies.\n\nRepresentative Hunter said, “[i]n particular, we are speaking of, in [Sections 6 and 7], about\n\nHutterite colonies” when he introduced HB 119 in the House Committee and reiterated this\n\nconcept to the Senate Committee. Mont. H. Comm. on Bus. & Labor, Hearing on H. Bill\n\n119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Jan. 8, 2009); Mont. Sen. Comm. on Bus., Labor, & Econ.\n\nAffairs, Hearing on H. Bill 119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 5, 2009). Senator Stewart-\n\nPeregoy characterized HB 119 and the corresponding Legislative debate as “targeting” the\n\n                                             35\n\fHutterites, stating, “if we’re going to target a group, we should have just put Hutterite\n\nreligious organizations and let’s be done with it. . . . [W]e are targeting a group and I just\n\nwanted that for the record.” Mont. Sen. Comm. on Bus., Labor, & Econ. Affairs, Hearing on\n\nH. Bill 119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 11, 2009). Additionally, Senator Balyeat\n\nacknowledged HB 119 was really “aimed” at the Hutterite religious colonies near Great\n\nFalls. Mont. Sen., Floor Session on H. Bill 119, 61st Legis., Reg. Sess. (Mar. 16, 2009).\n\nThe legislative record clearly shows that the objective intent of the legislators was none other\n\nthan to target the Hutterites.\n\n¶87    In response to this expressed legislative intention, the text of HB 119 was amended\n\nthroughout the legislative process to focus more and more narrowly on the Hutterites.\n\nLanguage was inserted within Section 6’s definition of employer to read “a religious\n\ncorporation, religious organization, or religious trust receiving remuneration from\n\nnonmembers for agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project\n\nconducted by its members on or off the property of the religious corporation, religious\n\norganization, or religious trust.” Section 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA (emphasis added). The\n\nlanguage “agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project”—instead of all\n\ncommercial activities—was inserted into HB 119 to incorporate only those specific business\n\nenterprises in which the Hutterites engaged. Here, the Court’s tactic of ignoring the facts\n\nand over-generalizing HB 119 and the Act as a whole in order to give the appearance that the\n\nAct applies equally to all employers is well illustrated. See Opinion, ¶ 21 (“HB 119\n\nregulates the Colony’s engagement in commercial activities in the same manner that the\n\nworkers’ compensation system regulates the commercial activities of other employers in\n                                              36\n\fMontana.”). The Court repeatedly states that HB 119 applies to all “commercial activities”\n\nand bases its analysis thereon. See Opinion ¶¶ 18, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 41, and 42.\n\nHowever, the text of HB 119 does not apply to “commercial activities” generally, nor does\n\nHB 119 use the term “commercial activities” at all. Rather, it employs the phrase\n\n“agricultural production, manufacturing, or a construction project”—only those economic\n\nactivities that the Legislature knew the Hutterites to be engaged in.\n\n¶88    Similarly, the Court makes repeated statements to the effect that all religious\n\nemployers are treated the same as other employers. See Opinion, ¶ 71 (“HB 119 treats\n\nreligious organizations no differently than any other employer under the workers’\n\ncompensation system”; “the Workers’ Compensation Act creates no separate classification\n\nunder HB 119 that singles out religious groups for different treatment.”). However, these\n\nstatements are not supported by the text of HB 119. Religious employers such as a\n\nPresbyterian Day Care, a Mormon Cleaning Service, or a Catholic Social Agency would not\n\nsatisfy HB 119’s definition of religious “employer” for multiple reasons, the first being that\n\nthey are not engaged in the economic activities targeted by the bill—“agricultural\n\nproduction, manufacturing, or a construction project.”2, 3\n\n\n2\n  These are examples of religious employers who would be exempt from participation under § 39-71-\n117(1)(d), MCA. However, it is possible that a social agency could come within the definition of\nemployer under § 39-71-117(c), MCA, if it was “funded in whole or in part by federal, state, or local\ngovernment funds.”\n3\n  The Court responds that HB 119 did not need to capture these other religious employers because\nthey and the Hutterites were already included under other statutory provisions. Opinion, ¶ 25. The\nCourt then reasons that the revision to the statutory definition of “wages” to include the concept of\n“remuneration” was all that was necessary to bring the Hutterites into the workers’ compensation\nsystem. Opinion, ¶ 26. The State has not made these assertions, and the Court cites neither to\nauthority nor to the record to support them. They are not supported by the plain language of the\nother provisions, which makes no reference to religious employers. If religious employers were\n                                                 37\n\f¶89    The Court distinguishes cases that have struck down legislation for violating the free\n\nexercise right by reasoning that HB 119 “does not place the Colony members in a\n\ndiscriminatory position compared to other religious groups who might choose to engage in\n\nsimilar activity. These distinctions lead us to reject the strict scrutiny analysis . . . .”\n\nOpinion, ¶ 21. Again, this distinction—and the conclusion based thereon to reject strict\n\nscrutiny review—is likewise belied by the text of HB 119. The Legislature cleverly drafted\n\nSections 6 and 7 to include only the Hutterites engaged in these economic activities and to\n\nexclude other religious groups. Under these provisions, an “employee” must be “a member”\n\nof the “religious corporation, religious organization, or religious trust while performing\n\nservices” for the organization. Correspondingly, an “employer” is defined as a religious\n\norganization engaged in the targeted economic activities only when such activities are\n\n“conducted by its members.” See Section 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. As mentioned, all\n\nHutterite labor is provided by members of their communal organization. The “performance\n\nof labor” is a religious exercise required of every member “to the extent of his or her ability”\n\nand is provided for the “personal religious purpose” of the members. Hutterites do not\n\nassociate for these purposes with nonmembers, who provide no labor for the organization.\n\nBy merely hiring employees who are not “members” of their organization, other religious\n\n\nalready completely encompassed by other provisions, it would have been unnecessary to create the\nnew category of “religious organization” within the statutory definition of “employer,” as HB 119\ndid. See § 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA. Likewise, it would have been unnecessary to create, within the\nstatutory definition of “employee,” the new category of a “member” of a religious organization\n“while performing services” for the religious organization. See § 39-71-118(1)(i), MCA. I note that\nthe former statutory provision under which the religious employer in St. John’s Lutheran Church\nwas required to participate in workers’ compensation was subsequently repealed. See Sec. 13, Ch.\n448, L. 2005. Context matters, and I believe that consideration of context should include all of the\n\n                                                38\n\forganizations choosing to participate in the named economic activities could be exempted\n\nfrom the provisions of HB 119. The tenets of the Hutterite religion, however, do not permit\n\nthis evasion, as their labor is provided by members only. HB 119 incorporates religious\n\norganizations within workers’ compensation only when “members” (§ 39-71-118(1)(i),\n\nMCA) of a religious organization provide labor and services to “nonmembers” (§ 39-71-\n\n117(1)(d), MCA)—a scheme which only applies to the religious structure of the Hutterites.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record that any other religious organization would be\n\nincorporated into the workers’ compensation system under these provisions.\n\n¶90    The text reveals further targeting of the Hutterites. HB 119 created the new financial\n\ncategory of “remuneration,” § 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA, and in other provisions drafted in\n\ntandem, revised § 39-71-123(5), MCA, to incorporate a method for calculating remuneration\n\nso that the Act would apply to the Hutterites, who receive no wages. No other religious\n\norganization is identified in the record as using a non-wage system. HB 119’s application to\n\nthe specified economic activities when “conducted by its members on or off the property” of\n\nthe religious organization, § 39-71-117(1)(d), MCA, is a reference to the practice of the\n\nHutterites living communally on their own property and providing services off their\n\nproperty.\n\n¶91    Some of these provisions could be potentially innocuous methods of defining a\n\nreligious entity for incorporation within the workers’ compensation system as part of a broad\n\ninclusion of all religious organizations within the system. However, the Legislature did not\n\n\n\ntext of HB 119, the Act as a whole, and the legislative history, which reveal an effort of laser-like\nprecision to capture only the Hutterites.\n                                                 39\n\fbroadly incorporate all religions. Rather, it enacted these provisions to define and target only\n\nthe Hutterite religion for inclusion within the system. While the text of HB 119 is not\n\nfacially discriminatory, its history and text reveal that it nonetheless fails to be neutral and\n\ngenerally applicable. “Official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment\n\ncannot be shielded by mere compliance with the requirement of facial neutrality.” Lukumi\n\nBabalu, 508 U.S. at 534, 113 S. Ct. at 2227. The effect of HB 119 is to create a religious\n\ngerrymander that improperly singles out one religion. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 535, 113\n\nS. Ct. at 2228 (“Apart from the text, the effect of a law in its real operation is strong evidence\n\nof its object.”). The significance of a religious gerrymander under the proper legal analysis\n\nis that it must sustain strict scrutiny review. Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 531-32, 113 S. Ct.\n\nat 2226.\n\n¶92    The Court relies on cases that rejected Free Exercise challenges to truly generally\n\napplicable statutes. Generally applicable laws are not subject to strict scrutiny review and\n\nthus are more easily defended against challenges. In Alamo Foundation and Jimmy\n\nSwaggart Ministries, religious organizations challenged labor and tax laws that were\n\ngenerally applicable to the commercial activities of all organizations, including religious\n\norganizations. Similarly, South Ridge Baptist Church, Lee, and Rogue Valley Youth for\n\nChrist challenged generally applicable tax and wage requirements. In these cases, the\n\nreligious organizations merely argued that compliance with such neutral and generally\n\napplicable requirements violated the tenets of their faith. Unlike HB 119, there was no effort\n\nin those cases to draft the challenged laws with the purpose to gerrymander and include a\n\n\n\n                                               40\n\fparticular religious organization within the system. The failure to draft HB 119 in a\n\ngenerally applicable manner necessarily requires strict scrutiny review.\n\n¶93    That being so, the State argues that a compelling state interest can be demonstrated. It\n\noffers that HB 119 was enacted for two legitimate government interests, including protection\n\nof the Uninsured Employers’ Fund (UEF) from potential liability for a catastrophic injury\n\nclaim filed by a Hutterite member and ensuring fair competition among businesses by\n\neliminating the Hutterites’ perceived advantage. Regarding the first, the UEF only applies to\n\nuninsured “employers” who are subject to the Act but have not provided coverage for their\n\nemployees. See Zempel v. Uninsured Employers’ Fund, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 431, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884357\"><a href=\"/opinion/884357/zempel-v-uninsured-employersfund/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n663 (1997) (citations omitted) (“[O]nly injured employees of employers meeting the\n\ndefinition of uninsured employer . . . are entitled to the ‘substitute’ workers’ compensation\n\nbenefits the UEF was created to provide to injured employees of employers who have failed\n\nto ‘properly comply’ with the Act. . . . As a result, the UEF has no funding mechanism to\n\nprovide ‘substitute’ workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees of employers not\n\nsubject to the Act.”). Consequently, prior to HB 119, a claim could not have been filed by a\n\nHutterite member against the UEF because the Colony was not an “employer” subject to the\n\nAct—and none have been filed. The State is attempting to legitimize HB 119 by arguing\n\nthat the bill provides a solution to a problem that did not exist prior to the bill’s enactment.\n\nAdditionally, even if the UEF was a legitimate government concern, HB 119 does not further\n\nthat concern. As noted by the District Court, a fundamental tenet of the Hutterites’ faith is\n\nthat they cannot make legal claims against others. The Hutterite faith includes “the\n\ncommandment to . . . not to seek redress before secular authorities whether related to secular\n                                              41\n\for sectarian issues.” A governmental interest in protecting the UEF from claims that are\n\nprohibited as a matter of law, made by people whose faith forbids them to make such claims,\n\ncan hardly be considered “legitimate.”\n\n¶94    The State’s second argument that HB 119 was enacted for a legitimate government\n\npurpose pertained to complaints from businesses about unequal competition with the\n\ncolonies. We recognize that the State has legitimate interests in the financial viability of the\n\nworkers’ compensation system, in controlling costs, and in providing benefits.

However, the State\n\nhas provided no authority for the proposition that ensuring “competitive fairness” among the\n\nstate’s businesses is an objective of the workers’ compensation system.

Further, the State has not made an effort to\n\ndemonstrate that requiring the Colony to pay for workers’ compensation coverage would\n\nactually address the concern over unfair competition, where any competitive advantage of\n\nthe Colony would appear to be primarily because of its nonpayment of the more substantial\n\nexpenses of wages and benefits, unique to the Colony’s religious beliefs. The State argues\n\nthat fairness “is a viable legislative goal, and the Legislature is entitled to take steps to ensure\n\nthat the workers’ compensation system is fair to all participants, whether religious or\n\nsecular.” However, whether or not “fairness” among competing businesses is a viable goal\n\nof the workers’ compensation system, it pales in comparison to “one of the most cherished\n                                                42\n\fand protected liberties in our society,” St. John’s Lutheran Church, 252 Mont. at 523, 830\n\nP.2d at 1276, and cannot be accomplished by legislation that targets a particular religious\n\ngroup and intrudes upon their internal religious practices. The State’s interest in insuring a\n\nviable workers’ compensation system or creating a “level playing field” is not legitimized by\n\nHB 119 in a way that satisfies the rigorous standards protecting the free exercise of religion.\n\n¶95    The State argues there is a compelling state interest because workers’ compensation,\n\nlike social security, “serves the public interest by providing a comprehensive insurance\n\nsystem with a variety of benefits available to all participants . . .” (quoting Lee, 455 U.S. at\n\n258, 102 S. Ct. at 1055), and this interest is advanced by HB 119’s intention to correct the\n\npurported unfair competitive advantage the Colony has over other businesses. However, HB\n\n119 fails to prohibit nonreligious conduct that endangers the State’s purported government\n\ninterests of preventing a catastrophic claim against the UEF and address the perceived\n\nbusiness advantage enjoyed by the Hutterites by not participating in the workers’\n\ncompensation system. The Workers’ Compensation Act currently exempts other areas of\n\nemployment in agriculture, manufacturing, and construction that could affect the UEF or the\n\nviability of the workers’ compensation system. For example, § 39-71-401(2), MCA,\n\nexempts certain employments from the Act, unless the employer elects coverage and the\n\ninsurer allows coverage, including: household or domestic employment (§ 39-71-401(2)(a)),\n\ncasual employment (§ 39-71-401(2)(b)), employment of a person performing services in\n\nreturn for aid or sustenance only (§ 39-71-401(2)(h)), a person who is employed by an\n\nenrolled tribal member or an association, business, corporation, or other entity that is at least\n\n51% owned by an enrolled tribal member or members, whose business is conducted solely\n                                               43\n\fwithin the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation (§ 39-71-401(2)(m)), and a person\n\nwho is an officer or manager of a ditch company (§ 39-71-401(2)(s)).4                 Similarly,\n\nindependent contractors may waive rights and benefits of the Act if they obtain an\n\nindependent contractor exemption (§ 39-71-401(3)). These exemptions are contrary to the\n\ngovernmental interests asserted by the State, and lend further credence that the Legislature’s\n\nintent, as demonstrated above, was to pursue “governmental interests only against conduct\n\nmotivated by religious belief.” Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 545, 113 S. Ct. at 2233.\n\n¶96    HB 119 is likewise not narrowly tailored and it places an impermissible burden on the\n\nHutterite religion. A law is narrowly tailored when the law achieves its stated ends without\n\nunduly burdening religion. See Lukumi Babalu, 508 U.S. at 546, 113 S. Ct. at 2234; Yoder,\n\n406 U.S. at 220-21, 92 S. Ct. at 1536. Following the United States Supreme Court, this\n\nCourt has previously applied the Thomas test to determine whether there is a burden on the\n\nfree exercise of religion:\n\n              Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct\n       proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of\n       conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on\n       an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon\n       religion exists.\n\nGriffith v.

Opportunity\n\nComm’n, ___ U.S. ___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620673\"><a href=\"/opinion/620673/hosanna-tabor-evangelical-lutheran-church-and-school-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012).\n\n¶97    The State argues that the burden imposed by the workers’ compensation system on the\n\nHutterites is incidental. However, it fails to recognize that the operation of HB 119 and the\n\nAct interferes with the internal relationship between the Colony and its members under the\n\ncentral tenets of the Hutterite faith. The Hutterite faith prohibits all property ownership, but\n\nthe Act requires injured employees to initiate and thus “own” a claim against the employer or\n\nits insurer to receive benefits under the Act. See § 39-71-603, MCA. The State argues, and\n\nthe Court accepts, that self-insurance is a viable option for the Colony, under which a claim\n\nwould be made to the Colony itself without any determination of whether a member is\n\npossessing property. See Opinion, ¶ 63. However, the statute cited for this premise, § 39-\n\n71-2103, MCA, actually provides that after an employer is approved to be self-insured, the\n\nemployer may “make payments directly to the employees as they may become entitled to\n\nreceive the payments.” Such payments to Colony members are exactly the problem because\n\nthe Colony’s beliefs require members to relinquish property and live communally.\n\n\n\n\nMont. 40, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"879423\"><a href=\"/opinion/879423/cottrill-v-cottrill-sodding-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">744</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">895</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987); Bennett v.

The Court’s solution for this religious burden is that\n\n“nothing prevents an injured Colony member from refraining to file a workers’\n\ncompensation claim or returning any workers’ compensation claim award” or, alternatively,\n\nthe Colony could proceed “to excommunicate a member who receives compensation for lost\n\nwages and refuses to give the money to the Colony.” Opinion, ¶ 68. The Court thus reasons\n\nthat the Hutterites could simply forego participation in the system to comply with its\n\nreligious beliefs. Yet, the financial burden would remain, for which no benefit would be\n\npaid. This is the very definition of illusory coverage that “defies logic” and violates public\n\npolicy. See Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"886567\"><a href=\"/opinion/886567/hardy-v-progressive-specialty-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 37, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"886567\"><a href=\"/opinion/886567/hardy-v-progressive-specialty-insurance-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">892</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The Court also reasons that the burden placed upon the Colony could be addressed\n\nby a member violating his religious tenets and having the Colony excommunicate the\n\nmember. Opinion, ¶ 68. I would suggest that this is not a permissible rationale for justifying\n\nthe State’s internal impact upon a religion’s practices.\n\n¶99    I would thus reject the State’s argument that the burden imposed here is incidental.\n\nHB 119 creates a substantial burden on the Colony’s religious practice because, in order for\n\nthe Colony and its members to actually participate under the Act, they must violate their\n\nsincerely held religious beliefs.5 HB 119 creates substantial internal intrusion into the\n\nreligious practices of the Colony and its members, burdening the Hutterites’ religious\n\n\n5\n No question has been raised about the sincerity of the Colony’s religious beliefs.

Verner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 n. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106660\"><a href=\"/opinion/106660/sherbert-v-verner/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Strict scrutiny review is not satisfied because the law is neither justified by a\n\ncompelling state interest nor narrowly tailored to advance that interest.6\n\n¶100 In my view, the Court fails in its duty to properly undertake the necessary\n\nconstitutional inquiry. The Court’s over-general statements do not acknowledge the facts of\n\nthe record. The Court’s reliance on Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective\n\nAssociation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112037\"><a href=\"/opinion/112037/lyng-v-northwest-indian-cemetery-protective-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112037\"><a href=\"/opinion/112037/lyng-v-northwest-indian-cemetery-protective-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Our Court has held that “only those interests of the highest order and those\n\nnot otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.” St.\n\nJohn’s Lutheran Church, 252 Mont. at 524, 830 P.2d at 1276 (quoting Miller v.

Had this been the status of religious freedom in 1620, the Pilgrims may well have\n\nsailed right by.\n\n¶101 I dissent.\n\n                                                     /S/ JIM RICE\n\nJustice Patricia O. Cotter and Justice Jim Nelson join in the dissenting Opinion of Justice\nRice.\n\n\n\n6\n  The Court responds to the claim that HB 119 intrudes into the religious practices of the Colony by\nlisting regulatory statutes that would apply to the Colony’s business activities. See Opinion, ¶ 62.\nHowever, these statutes regulate the Hutterites’ external activities and do not intrude into their\ninternal religious practices, as do the provisions at issue here.\n                                                47\n\f     /S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n     /S/ JAMES C.
