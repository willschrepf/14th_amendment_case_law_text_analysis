GARCIA, JUDGE PRESIDING</center>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong><hr size=\"3\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</strong>\tMitchel Wong, M.D., and Austin Eye Clinic Associates appeal a judgment in this\r\nmedical negligence case awarding George W. (Willard) Graham more than $700,000 in damages\r\nand prejudgment interest.  Appellants challenge the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence\r\nto support the jury's findings of proximate cause, foreseeability, causation, and damages. \r\nAppellants also challenge the admission of evidence of an unrelated lawsuit.  We will affirm the\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tOn October 2, 1997, Wong, a board-certified ophthalmologist and employee of\r\nAustin Eye Clinic Association, performed cataract surgery on Graham's left eye.  Though the\r\nsurgery was uneventful, the post-operative period was not.  Graham, who was seventy-three years\r\nold at time of trial, developed a series of problems culminating in his losing all sensitivity to light\r\nin the eye.  His treatment eventually moved to other doctors and culminated with an additional\r\nsurgery--the \"Gunderson flap\" procedure--that he considers disfiguring.  The jury found that\r\nappellants' negligence proximately caused the injury<sup>(1)</sup> to Graham.  It assessed damages for physical\r\npain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical impairment, and medical care at $200,000 in the\r\npast and $462,500 in the future; prejudgment interest increased the past damages judgment to\r\n$248,690.53.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe disputes on appeal concern Wong's responsibility for Graham's current\r\ncondition.  Appellants complain about the erroneous admission and misuse of evidence regarding\r\na lawsuit that Wong filed regarding an unrelated traffic accident.  Appellants also contend that\r\nGraham failed to present legally and factually sufficient evidence to prove cause, proximate cause,\r\nforeseeability, and damages.  Graham contends Wong caused his damages by not treating him\r\nproperly, not making proper notes, and not referring him timely to other physicians.  Graham\r\ncontends that his loss of vision, disfigurement, and suffering all resulted from Wong's\r\ncommissions and omissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><center>Evidence of Wong's lawsuit as plaintiff</center></strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe begin by examining appellants' complaint concerning the admission and use of\r\nevidence regarding an unrelated lawsuit.  Graham elicited testimony from Wong regarding a\r\nlawsuit he filed against a driver who rear-ended him.  Wong concedes that the evidence was\r\nadmissible to impeach his credibility; he testified at his deposition that he could not recall being\r\na plaintiff in non-medical lawsuits even though only three months before the deposition he had\r\nfiled the car-wreck suit, claiming that his injuries imperiled his career as a surgeon.  Though there\r\nwas some discussion outside the presence of the jury regarding the purposes for which this\r\ntestimony could be elicited, appellants did not request an instruction limiting the jury's use of the\r\ntestimony.  Evidence admitted without limitation is before the court for all purposes.  Tex. R.\r\nEvid. 105; <em>see Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Keeton</em>, 922 S.W.2d 658, 660 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Austin 1996, writ denied); <em>Cigna Ins. Co. v. Evans</em>, 847 S.W.2d 417, 421 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Texarkana 1993, no writ).  By not requesting a limiting instruction, appellants waived any\r\ncomplaint that the testimony was irrelevant to the issue of damages.  <em>See</em> Tex. R. Evid. 105; <em>see\r\nalso Birchfield v. Texarkana Memorial Hosp.</em>, 747 S.W.2d 361, 365 (Tex. 1987).  We find no\r\nreversible error and resolve this issue in favor of Graham.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><center>Sufficiency of the evidence</center></strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>Standards</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>\t</strong>Appellants' remaining three issues concern the legal and factual sufficiency of the\r\nevidence.  To review the evidence under a legal insufficiency or no-evidence point, we consider\r\nall the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, indulging every reasonable\r\ninference in that party's favor.  <em>See Associated Indem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc.</em>, 964\r\nS.W.2d 276, 285-86 (Tex. 1998).  We will uphold the finding if more than a scintilla of evidence\r\nsupports it.  <em>See Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye</em>, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499 (Tex. 1995).  The\r\nevidence supporting a finding amounts to more than a scintilla if reasonable minds could arrive\r\nat the finding given the facts proved in the particular case.  <em>See id.</em>  When reviewing the factual\r\nsufficiency of the evidence, we must consider and weigh all the evidence and should set aside the\r\njudgment only if the evidence is so weak or so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\r\nevidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.  <em>See Cain v. Bain</em>, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986). \r\nWe will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact merely because we might have\r\nreached a different conclusion.  <em>See Westech Eng'g, Inc. v. Clearwater Constructors, Inc.</em>, 835\r\nS.W.2d 190, 196 (Tex. App.--Austin 1992, no writ).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tPlaintiffs in medical negligence cases must prove:  (1) a duty by the physician to\r\nact according to a certain standard; (2) a breach of the applicable standard of care; (3) an injury;\r\nand (4) a causal connection between the breach of care and the injury.  <em>Ortiz v. Shah</em>, 905 S.W.2d\r\n609, 610 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1995, writ denied).  To show proximate cause,\r\nplaintiffs must show that the doctor caused the injury and that the injury was foreseeable.  <em>Bradley\r\nv. Rogers</em>, 879 S.W.2d 947, 953 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied).  Plaintiffs\r\nmust show a \"reasonable medical probability\" that the defendants proximately caused their injuries;\r\nplaintiffs must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants' negligent act or\r\nomission was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm and without which the harm would\r\nnot have occurred.  <em>Park Place Hosp. v. Estate of Milo, </em>909 S.W.2d 508, 511 (Tex. 1995); <em>see\r\nalso Bradley</em>, 879 S.W.2d at 953-54.  Proof of mere conjecture, speculation, or possibility is\r\ninsufficient.  <em>Duff v. Yelin</em>, 751 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1988).  Plaintiffs are not required,\r\nhowever, to disprove all alternative hypotheses.  <em>Bradley</em>, 879 S.W.2d at 954.  A possible cause\r\nbecomes probable when the absence of other reasonable causal explanations makes the possible\r\ncause more likely than not the cause of the injury.  <em>Id.</em>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong>Summary of treatments</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>August 27, 1997\tWong removes a pterygium--a growth on the surface of Graham's left eye. \r\nWong prescribes an antibiotic steroid eye drop, tapes and patches Graham's\r\neye.  Graham experiences no problem with his vision.  Graham's vision in\r\nhis left eye improves to 20/50 without correction.  His uncorrected vision\r\nin his right eye is 20/60.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\t\tWong also notes that Graham has cataracts in both eyes and entropion with\r\ntrichiasis on his left lower lid; Graham's musculature changed, causing his\r\neyelashes to rub his eye and irritate it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>September 9, 1997\tGraham's cornea has healed from the pterygium removal.  Graham still has\r\ntrichiasis.  After Graham declines to have surgery to correct the condition,\r\nWong removes the troublesome lashes.  They schedule surgery to remove\r\na cataract from his left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>September 30, 1997\tGraham has a preoperative visit with Wong.  Graham's vision tests at 20/50\r\nin both eyes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 2, 1997\tWong removes the cataract from Graham's left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 3, 1997\tAt the first post-operative visit, Graham has some corneal edema, corneal\r\nswelling, and decreased vision.  He could count fingers only at one foot. \r\nWong prescribed a topical steroid for use three times a day.  They set an\r\nappointment for cataract removal from the right eye on October 16,\r\ncontingent on improvement in the left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 8, 1997\tGraham's eye is slightly improved and the cornea is clearing.  Wong\r\ndecreases the frequency of the steroid application to twice daily, but cancels\r\nthe October 16 surgery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 22, 1997\tGraham's sight is slightly improved.  He can count fingers two feet away. \r\nHis left eye has keratic precipitates with a pupillary membrane, indicating\r\ninflammation in the anterior chamber.  Wong notes moderately severe\r\nuveitis, a non-infectious inflammation.  Wong concludes that an infection\r\nin the eye, endophthalmitis, is possible, but not probable.  To combat the\r\nincreased inflammation, Wong increases the frequency of the steroid\r\napplication to every waking hour and prescribes an eye-muscle relaxant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 27, 1997\tGraham's caretaker, Brenda Farrar, calls Wong's office to report that\r\nGraham's eye hurts and is red and draining; she requests something\r\nstronger for the pain.  The staff tells Graham to come in as soon as\r\npossible.  Wong's son, a board-certified ophthalmologist and Austin Eye\r\nClinic employee, calls a refill of the eye-drop prescription and leaves a\r\nmessage for Farrar that she need not bring Graham in for an office visit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>November 4, 1997\tWong examines Graham and notes that Graham's eye had foreign body\r\nsensation, corneal edema, a fibrous pupillary membrane, and hypopyon--an\r\naccumulation of white blood cells in the anterior chamber.  Graham could\r\nno longer count fingers, but could detect hand motion.  Wong again\r\ndiscounts the probability of endophthalmitis and concludes that Graham has\r\nsinusitis, for which he prescribes ampicillin.  He continues the dosage of\r\nthe eye drops and the muscle relaxant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>November 12, 1997\tWong refills prescriptions for ampicillin, eye drops, and muscle relaxants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>November 25, 1997\tGraham's vision and condition are essentially unchanged.  Wong diagnoses\r\npostoperative uveitis of undetermined etiology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>December 3, 1997\tGraham skips an appointment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>December 16, 1997\tIn addition to the previously noted symptoms, Wong notes keratitis with\r\ncorneal deepithelialization.  Because topical steroids retard\r\nreepithelialization, Wong reduces eyedrop dosage to four times daily,\r\ncontinuing the drops to treat the inflammation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>January 13, 1998\tGraham's corneal ulcer is infected, the inflammation is worse, and vision\r\nis reduced to light perception only.  His pain, redness, and discharge are\r\nworse.  Wong refers Graham to Brian Berger, a retinal specialist.  Wong\r\nconfers by telephone with Berger and faxes him Graham's records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\t\tBerger examines Graham, performing an ultrasound and an anterior\r\nchamber tap.  The ultrasound does not indicate endophthalmitis, nor does\r\nthe tap produce a bacterial culture; Berger concludes that endophthalmitis\r\nis very unlikely, and ascribes Graham's symptoms to the corneal ulcer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>January 14, 1998\tGraham still has light perception only.  Wong diagnoses a corneal ulcer\r\nwith hypopyon.  This is Graham's final visit to Wong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Graham sought treatment from other doctors.  The corneal ulcer had almost perforated his eye. \r\nThe new doctors eventually performed a Gunderson flap procedure, which involves pulling the\r\nconjunctiva, the mucus layer of the eye, over the cornea.  The procedure saved his eye, but not\r\nits vision; Graham has no light perception in his left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong>Specific contentions of insufficiency</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants submit many reasons that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient.  They argue Graham did not show that they were responsible for his damages; that\r\nis, he did not show reasonable medical probability of proximate causation and foreseeability. \r\nThey also argue that he failed to segregate which damages, if any, resulted from appellants' care. \r\nThey further argue that the evidence does not support the amount of damages awarded.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tGraham's theory of the case is that appellants caused his loss of vision by not\r\nadequately diagnosing and treating his condition.  He contends that Wong should have diagnosed\r\nendophthalmitis and treated him or referred him for treatment based on that diagnosis. \r\nAlternatively he argues that the only possible other cause was uveitis, which Wong failed to\r\nadequately diagnose and treat or refer him for that condition.  He contends that his loss of vision\r\nis a foreseeable result of the inadequate treatment.  Graham contends that the evidence was legally\r\nand factually sufficient to support every necessary element.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<strong><em>Causation and foreseeability of loss of light perception.  </em></strong>Graham's experts, C.\r\nBradley Bowman and Richard Ruiz both testified that Graham's loss of vision resulted from\r\nundiagnosed endophthalmitis.<sup>(2)</sup>  They agreed that, following cataract surgery, infection should be\r\na primary concern, particularly when the post-operative patient shows unexpectedly severe\r\ninflammation or pain.  They testified that endophthalmitis must be a leading diagnosis until ruled\r\nout because untreated infections will lead to loss of vision; early treatment is critical.  Ruiz\r\ntestified that Wong should have taken a culture of Graham's vitreous and injected antibiotics into\r\nhis eye on October 22 even before the culture results returned.  Ruiz said oral and topical\r\nantibiotics do not get adequate concentrations into the eye.  Bowman, Ruiz, and James Everett\r\nKey, II testified that pupillary membranes like Graham developed are mainly or likely caused by\r\nendophthalmitis.  They pointed to other signs of infection such as impaired vision and keratic\r\nprecipitates--clumps of white blood cells next to the cornea.  Bowman testified that by January the\r\nproblems at the front of the eye, possibly caused by too lengthy use of steroid eye drops, misled\r\nBerger and precluded him from visually inspecting the back of the eye where the infection was\r\ndestroying Graham's vision.  Bowman discounts the results of Berger's ultrasound and anterior\r\neye tap, asserting (with Berger's agreement) that ultrasounds often fail to diagnose endophthalmitis\r\nand that the anterior tap is less likely to show an infection of the vitreous at the back of the eye. \r\nBerger and Ruiz agreed that suspected endophthalmitis cases cause positive cultures for bacteria\r\nonly about half the time; Ruiz said anterior aqueous taps are even less accurate.  Berger also\r\nconceded that topical steroids like Graham was using can mask signs of infection for short periods\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBowman testified that diagnosing uveitis before ruling out endophthalmitis is below\r\nthe standard of care.  He testified that uveitis in a post-operative cataract patient would be\r\nextraordinarily coincidental; he also testified that a patient whose eye was as nonresponsive to\r\nuveitis treatment as Graham's eye should have gotten much more extensive testing and treatment\r\nby November.  Bowman said that cases in which uveitis led to total vision loss were\r\nextraordinarily rare; neither he nor Wong had seen a patient lose all light perception as a result\r\nof uveitis.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBowman and Ruiz were also critical of administrative aspects of Wong's treatment\r\nof Graham.  They testified that Wong should have seen Graham more frequently than every two\r\nto three weeks; Ruiz described this frequency as \"woefully inadequate.\"  Between the October\r\nsurgery and the January referral to Berger, Wong did not perform diagnostic tests, change the eye\r\ndrops (other than the frequency of dosage), see Graham more frequently than two week intervals\r\n(though at least one of the gaps was due to Graham's no-show at appointment), call another\r\ndoctor, or refer him to another doctor.  Bowman and Ruiz testified that Wong's records were\r\nsubpar, failing to note complaints of pain.  Bowman was particularly bothered by the absence from\r\nthe charts of a telephone message taken by Austin Eye Clinic Association staff from Graham's\r\ncaretaker requesting more pain medication because Graham was \"still\" in pain--indicating present\r\nand past pain which Bowman felt was not adequately recorded in the charts.  Berger noted that\r\nGraham had a three-day history of pain.  Bowman testified that the lack of consistent pain notation\r\nmisled Berger into believing that Graham's pain and problems in January arose from the corneal\r\nulcer.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThough Graham primarily contends that he suffered from untreated\r\nendophthalmitis, he contends alternatively that Wong did not adequately treat him for uveitis.<sup>(3)</sup>\r\nUveitis, however, should respond to topical steroids.  Bowman testified that it should have cleared\r\nwithin three to five days following the October 22 visit when Wong increased the eyedrop dose\r\nto hourly.  It did not.  Instead, it worsened.  Graham's condition was worse than any of the\r\ntestifying doctors had seen in a post-operative cataract patient.  Nevertheless, Wong did not use\r\nthe more aggressive treatments (full work-up, chest x-ray, blood tests, other modes of steroid\r\ndelivery, and more frequent examinations) that Bowman testified were the standard of care for\r\nnonresponsive uveitis.  Though Wong may have reasonably not given Graham oral steroids\r\nbecause of the potential side effects, Berger testified that persistent uveitis can be treated with\r\nsteroid ointments and steroid injections near the eye to avoid the systemic side effects of oral\r\nsteroids.  Berger agreed that Graham should have been examined more frequently because he was\r\nnot responding to treatment.  Ruiz agreed that Wong's treatment of Graham was completely\r\ninadequate if the condition was uveitis.  He agreed that uveitis could have caused the vision loss.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWong testified he did nothing inappropriate that led to Graham's vision loss.  He\r\nconcluded that Graham did not have endophthalmitis and diagnosed Graham's highly abnormal\r\npost-operative condition as uveitis; Berger and Key agreed that endophthalmitis was highly\r\nunlikely.  Wong treated Graham with steroid eyedrops.  He testified that he or his staff would have\r\nwritten down a complaint of pain had Graham voiced it; in fact, Wong or his staff noted on the\r\ncharts more than once that Graham was suffering either pain or foreign body sensation.  Berger's\r\nJanuary examination revealed that Graham's eye was \"quiet\"--it lacked the level of inflammation\r\nconsonant with infection of the vitreous.  He tapped the anterior part of the eye because that is the\r\nportion in which his examination showed hypopyon (pus).  Both the ultrasound and the tap showed\r\nno infection.  Key testified that Graham lost his eyesight to persistent uveitis ocular inflammation. \r\nKey testified that Graham did not respond to any type of therapy so there was no indication\r\nwhether more aggressive treatment would have helped.  Wong agreed with that assessment,\r\ntestifying that ninety-nine percent of patients would have healed from the ulcer; even aggressive\r\nantibiotic treatment did not heal the ulcer until the Gunderson flap procedure.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThere was also evidence that Graham was not the most diligent in obtaining care.\r\nHe may not have communicated his complaints clearly.  He reported that he did not always\r\nadminister the eyedrops with the frequency Wong prescribed.  He may have abraded his cornea\r\nwith eyelashes or a paper towel.  More than once, whether due to transportation difficulties or\r\nother reasons, he prolonged the gap between office visits slightly beyond the three weeks Wong\r\nrecommended. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants also argue that, if there is blame, perhaps Berger or subsequent treating\r\ndoctors should bear at least some of it.  Graham could perceive the difference between light and\r\ndarkness when Wong referred him to Berger, and yet Graham lost even that perception after the\r\nreferral.  With the exception of the October phone message regarding pain, Berger had the same\r\ninformation from Wong that Bowman used in formulating his opinion, yet agreed with Wong's\r\nrejection of endophthalmitis after two examinations of Graham.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe conclude that legally and factually sufficient evidence support the jury's\r\nfindings that appellants proximately caused Graham's total loss of vision and that such loss was\r\nforeseeable.  Evidence supported a conclusion that either untreated endophthalmitis or mistreated\r\nuveitis caused Graham's vision loss and that neither a corneal ulcer nor macular degeneration\r\nwould result in loss of light perception.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWong agreed that \"it's more likely than not that [a patient] will lose sight and go\r\nto no light perception in an untreated infection in the eye.\"  Endophthalmitis is a risk following\r\ncataract surgery.  Graham exhibited the hallmarks of endophthalmitis from the outset of the post-operative period:  pain, inflammation, and decreased vision.  There was evidence that appellants'\r\nfrequency of examination, diagnosis, charting, and treatment were below the standard of care. \r\nThough Wong considered infection at every examination, he waited three months before taking\r\nadditional steps to rule out infection despite the poor condition of Graham's eye.  Graham never\r\nreceived the intraocular injection of antibiotics--the standard of care for endophthalmitis--that\r\nroutinely wipe out almost all bacteria in the eye.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIf Graham's condition was uveitis, evidence supports a finding that appellants' care\r\nwas inadequate; despite Graham's nonresponsiveness to treatment, appellants neither significantly\r\naltered his treatment nor increased the frequency of examination.  There also was evidence that\r\nWong's charts did not include all the necessary elements and that a telephoned complaint of\r\npersistent pain was not included in the information transmitted to Berger.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThough Graham may have had some light perception when referred to Berger, there\r\nwas evidence that Graham's corneal ulcer (which evidence supports finding was caused or\r\nworsened by the long-term use of steroid eyedrops), coupled with Wong's spotty charting, led\r\nBerger to focus on the ulcer.  Evidence supports a finding that the severity of the ulcer left\r\nsubsequent doctors with no reasonable choice but to perform the Gunderson flap.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMore than a scintilla of evidence supports the findings that Graham's loss of vision\r\nwas foreseeable and was proximately caused by appellants' actions and omissions; the evidence\r\nis not so weak or so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong\r\nand unjust.  The existence of expert testimony controverting other expert testimony presents a\r\nchoice for the jury to make, but does not require reversal.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<strong><em>Causation and foreseeability of disfigurement.</em></strong>  Similarly, sufficient evidence\r\nsupports findings that Graham's disfigurement was foreseeable and proximately caused by Wong's\r\ntreatment of the ulcer.  The disfigurement is a result of the deteriorated condition of the eye and\r\nthe Gunderson flap procedure.  Wong first noted deepithelialization on December 16.  He reduced\r\nthe frequency of use of topical steroid eyedrops from hourly to four times daily.  Records from\r\na January 21 examination show that an abrasion on the cornea came from wiping with a paper\r\ntowel.  Though admitting that an eye ulcer could potentially progress exactly as Graham's had\r\nwith proper treatment, Bowman testified that Wong's treatment of the ulcer probably led to the\r\ndisfiguring surgery.  Bowman testified that \"the continued use of steroids without appropriate\r\nantibiotic treatment could have caused and <em>probably caused </em>this ulcer to become worse because\r\nit wasn't treated appropriately.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Berger agreed that hourly application of\r\nsteroid eyedrops foreseeably increases the risk of a corneal ulcer.  Ruiz testified that continuing\r\nthe use of the topical steroids after finding the ulcer made it worse.  He and Bowman said that the\r\nstandard of care required taking a culture of the eye, stopping the steroid eye drop, and starting\r\nan antibiotic eyedrop--none of which Wong did.  The steroids would cause the eye surface to thin\r\nto near perforation.  The dramatic thinning of the eye caused the subsequent doctors to perform\r\nthe Gunderson flap procedure to save the eye, resulting in the disfigurement about which Graham\r\ncomplains.  Legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the conclusion that appellants\r\nforeseeably and proximately caused the disfigurement.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<em><strong>Damages.</strong></em>  Appellants' remaining issues concern damages.  Appellants contend that\r\ninsufficient evidence supported a link between their conduct and Graham's loss of vision and\r\ndamages.  They also contend that insufficient evidence supports the amount of damages.  We first\r\nwill examine the sufficiency of the link between appellants' treatment and the damages awarded\r\nto Graham.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<u><em>Segregation</em></u>.  Appellants first complain that Graham failed to segregate the damages\r\ncaused by appellants from damages caused by other persons and other factors.  The damage award\r\nwas made in response to a broad-form question asking for a single sum to compensate for physical\r\npain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical impairment, and medical care; the question\r\nrequested separate amounts for past damages and future damages.  Appellants complain about the\r\nproof of the damages, not the form of the question.<sup>(4)</sup>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tA plaintiff must prove that the negligent actions for which the plaintiff sues\r\nnecessitated the medical expenses for which the plaintiff seeks recovery.  <em>Texarkana Memorial\r\nHosp., Inc. v. Murdock</em>, 946 S.W.2d 836, 840-41 (Tex. 1997).  In <em>Murdock</em>, an infant died after\r\nmonths of treatments for multiple problems--some present at birth and some caused by hospital\r\nmalpractice.  <em>Id.</em> at 837.  The jury awarded $250,000 to the decedent's estate (not appealed) and\r\n$500,000 to the decedent's mother for medical expenses out of a total bill of $748,710.44. <em> Id.</em> \r\nThe supreme court held that the court of appeals could not properly have held the jury's award was\r\nsupported by factually sufficient evidence because the plaintiffs had not introduced evidence about\r\nwhich treatments addressed the malpractice-induced condition; the supreme court rejected the\r\nargument that the jury's paring of the requested award showed they deducted charges for\r\ntreatments not resulting from the negligence.  <em>Id.</em> at 840.  The supreme court held that a plaintiff\r\nmust provide expert medical testimony to explain what medical procedures treated the negligently\r\ncreated condition.  <em>Id</em>. at 841.  The court wrote that medical expenses were susceptible to such\r\ndetailed proof, unlike \"nebulous measures of damages such as pain and suffering where the jury\r\nhas broad discretion when fixing an amount to award.\"  <em>Id</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tA significant distinction between <em>Murdock</em> and this appeal is the nature of the\r\ndamages challenged.  The <em>Murdock</em> appeal concerned only the medical expenses award, but\r\nmedical expenses in this case were at most $10,545.74<sup>(5)</sup> of the $200,000 past damage award.  This\r\ndamage award is thus much less susceptible of quantification than the award in <em>Murdock</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAnother distinction is that the contribution from sources of injury other than the\r\ndefendants' negligence is less than in <em>Murdock</em>.  In that case, the decedent suffered from many\r\ncongenital problems besides those arising from the hospital's negligence.  The medical expenses\r\ncould be divided between the treatments for the negligence-induced condition and the congenital\r\nproblems.  Here, all damages flow from the disfigurement of and loss of light perception in\r\nGraham's left eye.  We have concluded above that sufficient evidence supports a finding that\r\ninadequacies in appellants' treatment of Graham, their monitoring of his condition, and their\r\ncharting of his progress was a cause of both injuries.  That finding was not overwhelmed by\r\nevidence regarding other possible sources of injury such as Graham's poor healing ability, Graham\r\nscratching his cornea with a tissue, macular degeneration, and treatment by other doctors.  All\r\nthese had countervailing considerations.  Testimony that Graham was a bad healer was blunted by\r\nthe lack of more aggressive or different treatments in the early stages; the only certainty is that\r\nGraham did not respond well to the treatments given.  Regardless of the ulcer's cause, there was\r\nevidence that treatment of the eye's problems (particularly the continued use of steroid eye drops)\r\nprevented healing of the ulcer.  The only evidence of macular degeneration in his left eye was that\r\nhe had it in his right eye (the ramifications of that for his left eye were disputed); macular\r\ndegeneration undisputedly had not robbed and would not rob Graham of light perception in his\r\nright eye.  Though Graham might have recovered some sight when referred to other doctors, there\r\nis evidence that appellants' previous treatment of Graham and charting inadequacies frustrated that\r\npossibility.  Thus, the jury reasonably could have found that all of the measures of Graham's\r\ninjuries flowed from appellants' treatment of him.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tFurther, if sufficient evidence connects appellants to the injuries, we must presume\r\nthat the jury followed its instructions and awarded damages only for injuries caused by appellants'\r\nnegligence.  <em>See Turner, Collie &amp; Braden, Inc. v. Brook hollow, Inc.</em>, 642 S.W.2d 160, 167 (Tex.\r\n1982);<em> see also Phillips v. Phillips</em>, 820 S.W.2d 785, 787, n.2 (Tex. 1991).  In <em>Phillips</em>, the\r\nsupreme court affirmed an appellate court's rendition of an attorney's fees award in addition to\r\nthe actual damages award.  The supreme court rejected the defendant's argument that the jury must\r\nhave included the attorney's fee award as part of the plaintiff's damages, writing the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>The trial court properly did not ask the jury to include in its determination of\r\nMartha's actual damages a reasonable fee for legal services necessary to her\r\nprosecution of the case.  <em>See Hammonds v. Hammonds</em>, 158 Tex. 516, 313 S.W.2d\r\n603, 605 (1958).  We must assume that the jury followed the trial court's\r\ninstructions and answered the question put to them.  <em>See Turner, Collie &amp; Braden\r\nv. Brookhollow, Inc.</em>, 642 S.W.2d 160, 167 (Tex.1982).  Given that assumption,\r\nwe must conclude that the jury's answer of $300,000 to the trial court's question\r\ndid not include attorney fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Harry argues that, logically, the jury must have arrived at their $300,000 finding\r\nby adding $37,585 accounting fees which Martha testified she incurred to the\r\nstipulated $250,000 in attorney fees.  However plausible Harry's explanation of the\r\njury's reasoning process may be, it cannot substitute for the jury's finding.  What\r\nthe jury found, not why the jury found it, is the relevant inquiry absent jury\r\nmisconduct.  <em>First Nat'l Bank v. Zimmerman</em>, 442 S.W.2d 674, 678 (Tex.1969). \r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><em>Id</em>.  Here, the jury was asked first if appellants' negligence caused Graham's injury, then what sum\r\nof money would fairly compensate Graham for injuries that resulted from the occurrence in\r\nquestion.  If sufficient evidence supports the award, we must presume that the jury followed the\r\ncourt's instructions and excluded damages, if any, caused by other sources.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<u><em>Elements of damages</em></u>.  We will examine the evidence regarding the elements of the\r\ndamage award:  disfigurement, impairment, physical pain and mental anguish, and medical care.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence supports an award for disfigurement.  Disfigurement is that\r\nwhich impairs or injures the beauty, symmetry, or appearance of a person by rendering him\r\nunsightly, misshapen, imperfect, or deformed.  <em>See Transit Management Co. v. Sanchez</em>, 886\r\nS.W.2d 823, 826 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1994, no writ).  The damages compensate for the\r\nsuffering, including humiliation, induced in the mind of the injured party by contemplating his\r\nchanged physical condition.  <em>See Houston Lighting &amp; Power v. Reed</em>, 365 S.W.2d 26, 30 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Houston 1963, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  As discussed above, during appellants' three months\r\nof treatment, Graham's eye was inflamed and oozing pus; sufficient evidence showed appellants'\r\ntreatments were inadequate.  Now, the eye is dim and somewhat shriveled.  Appellants argue that\r\nthey did not perform the Gunderson flap that permanently altered his eye, and point to Graham's\r\ndeposition testimony that his feelings had not changed since the surgery.  As discussed above,\r\nhowever, evidence supports a finding that the Gunderson flap procedure was the inexorable result\r\nof appellants' negligence--the other option was rupture of the eye.  One of Graham's caretakers\r\nsaid that Graham's remarkably blue eyes were his one source of vanity, and that now he is\r\nembarrassed for anyone to see his eye because he thinks he looks like a rooster pecked out his eye. \r\nIn trial, he described his eye as disgraceful.  Further, the jury saw Graham's eye for eight days\r\nand could judge for itself whether the eye was disfigured.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence showed that Graham's loss of vision and disfigurement\r\nconstricted his range of activities.  Damages for impairment may be awarded for restriction of\r\nactivities, but the limitation must be distinct from other damage measures such as pain and lost\r\nincome; examples include limitations on the ability to mow lawns, engage in strenuous tasks,\r\ndrive, walk without assistance, perform routine car maintenance, or play recreational sports. \r\n<em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Harlow</em>, 729 S.W.2d 946, 950 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1987,\r\nwrit denied).  Appellants argue that Graham's activities were curtailed before the surgery, pointing\r\nto the fact that his mother willed her property to some younger people on condition that they care\r\nfor him for his life.  They also note Graham's continued ability to cook and clean inside his home\r\nas evidence that he is not impaired.  There was evidence, however, that the loss of vision has\r\nlimited his activities.  Before his surgery, he played the fiddle, changed watch batteries, cleaned\r\nup his yard, took trash to a dump, mowed, repaired lawnmowers and a tractor, and fed cattle.  He\r\ndrove himself five miles to Marble Falls and ran errands; for longer trips, he depended on others\r\neven before the surgery.  He hunted, plowed and cut a field of maize, helped install a deer fence,\r\nwalked the ranch to find newborn calves, and walked to visit friends; all of this involved walking\r\nover uneven ground.  Now, however, his lack of depth perception and vision severely limits his\r\nactivities.  He no longer plays the fiddle because he cannot see adequately to string it.  He has\r\ntrouble getting around in unfamiliar places.  He loses his balance and falls, so he is extremely\r\nreluctant to go outside his home.  He no longer helps with outside chores or drives himself\r\nanywhere.  Sufficient evidence supports an award for impairment.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence also supports Graham's complaints of pain.  Though he had\r\ndays without pain during his treatment by appellants, his eye was inflamed for more than three\r\nmonths.  Graham also complained of a dull ache behind his eye.  It eventually oozed pus.  The\r\nlack of improvement and deterioration of his condition have been linked to appellants' treatment\r\nof him.  Wong prescribed pain medications in addition to over-the-counter pain medications.  Loss\r\nof depth perception from his loss of vision caused him to fall and suffer scrapes and bruises. \r\nDuring trial, Graham showed an injury from such a fall.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence also supports Graham's claims of mental anguish.  To sustain\r\nsuch a claim, the record must contain evidence of substantial disruption of daily routine or a high\r\ndegree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation,\r\nembarrassment, or anger.  <em>Parkway Co. v. Woodruff</em>, 901 S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995). \r\nAppellants tout Graham's deposition testimony that nothing about his feelings or mental health had\r\nchanged.  At trial, however, he testified that his eye's condition ruined his life.  Others testified\r\nthat he seemed depressed.  One of his caretakers testified that Graham said she might as well\r\nknock him over the head, that his life was over because he could not see.  This experience makes\r\nhim fearful of medical care in general, and adamant against surgery to treat the cataract in his right\r\neye.  He is afraid to walk outside and does not like people to see his eye despite reassurances that\r\nthe eye is not repulsive.  That fear and embarrassment play roles in the restriction of his activity\r\nshows his confinement has a mental component.  Though some of the evidence advanced by\r\nGraham (i.e., worries about being sent to a nursing home if something happened to his caretakers)\r\nmay not be severe enough or tied closely enough to these injuries to be compensable, anxiety and\r\ndepression that leave a previously active man essentially homebound, embarrassed to be seen in\r\npublic, fearful of medical treatment, and opining that his life is over show a substantial disruption\r\nof his daily routine and a high degree of mental strain.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants' challenge to the evidence of medical expenses is somewhat different. \r\nThe district court admitted Graham's evidence of his medical bills based on Bowman's testimony\r\nthat the charges were reasonable and necessary.  Appellants contended that some of the charges\r\nwere neither reasonable nor necessary because Medicare paid reduced charges and appellants could\r\nnot collect the difference from anyone; thus, they argued, Graham cannot recover that which was\r\nnever paid.  The district court refused to admit appellants' evidence of the reduced Medicare\r\npayments, but allowed appellants to make an offer of proof.  On appeal, appellants challenge, not\r\nthe exclusion of their evidence, but the reasonableness and necessity of the expenses awarded.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tEvidence of the Medicare payments and reductions are a collateral source of\r\npayment, one that the court did not have to admit.  The collateral source rule is a long-standing\r\ntenet of Texas law that the defendant should not get the benefit of payment arrangements that\r\nmight reduce or eliminate plaintiff's out-of-pocket expenses. <em>See City of Fort Worth v. Barlow</em>,\r\n313 S.W.2d 906, 911 (Tex. Civ. App.--Fort Worth 1958, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (medical expense\r\naward not reduced by plaintiff's option to receive cheaper or free care in veterans hospital); <em>see\r\nalso Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Levi &amp; Bro.</em>, 59 Tex. 674, 676 (1883) (damages not offset by\r\nplaintiff's insurance compensation); <em>Century Papers, Inc. v. Perrino</em>, 551 S.W.2d 507, 511 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Texarkana 1977, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (wrongful discharge damages not reduced by\r\nunemployment benefits).<sup>(6)</sup>  Thus, if the treatment and charges are reasonable and necessary to treat\r\nthe patient, recovery is permitted regardless of what was actually paid or will be paid for the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBowman's testimony that the charges were reasonable and necessary was\r\nuncontroverted.  As discussed above, evidence supports a finding that Graham's post-operative\r\ncondition was worsened by inadequate medical care, prompting these medical expenses.  Even if\r\nGraham caused the initial scratch of his cornea, sufficient evidence supports finding that\r\nappellants' treatment exacerbated the injury.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>\t<em>Damage totals.</em></strong>  The jury has wide latitude in determining the amount of a personal\r\ninjury damage award.  <em>Baptist Memorial Hosp. Sys. v. Smith</em>, 822 S.W.2d 67, 78 (Tex. App.--San\r\nAntonio 1991, writ denied).  Matters of pain and suffering are speculative and not subject to\r\nprecise mathematical calculations; determining those amounts is particularly within the province\r\nof the jury.  <em>Lee v. Huntsville Livestock Servs., Inc.</em>, 934 S.W.2d 158, 160-61 (Tex.\r\nApp.--Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ); <em>Mercy Hosp. v. Rios</em>, 776 S.W.2d 626, 636 (Tex.\r\nApp.--San Antonio 1989, writ denied).  In determining future medical expenses, the jury has wide \r\ndiscretion to consider the nature of the injury, the medical care rendered in the past, and the\r\ncondition of the injured party at the time of the trial.  <em>Southwest Texas Coors, Inc. v. Morales</em>, 948\r\nS.W.2d 948, 952 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1997, no writ).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe perceive no basis on which we can overturn or reduce the $200,000 award for\r\npast damages.  As discussed above, almost ninety percent (and perhaps more) of the past damages\r\naward was intended to compensate for physical pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical\r\nimpairment--damages deemed \"nebulous\" by the supreme court in <em>Murdock</em>.  <em>See</em> 946 S.W.2d at\r\n841.  Graham suffered pain during treatment and continues to injure himself because of the result\r\nof that treatment.  He was and remains disfigured.  His activities were restricted by both his\r\nimpairment and the mental anguish associated with it.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tNor do we perceive a basis on which we can overturn or reduce the $462,500 award\r\nfor future damages.  Though Graham may not suffer as much pain and medical expenses in the\r\nfuture as a result of his treatment by appellants, his impairment and disfigurement will continue,\r\nas will his resulting mental anguish.  Appellants' suggestion that he could possibly get a cornea\r\ntransplant at most shifts the damages.  Assuming appellant overcame his dread of medical\r\nprocedures caused by his previous treatment, the transplant definitely would increase his future\r\nmedical expenses and would decrease his other damages only if the procedure worked; and some\r\nwitnesses doubted that the vision in or appearance of Graham's left eye could ever be improved. \r\nGraham's statistical life expectancy at time of trial was 10.4 years, but his mother lived eighteen\r\nyears beyond his age at trial.  Using those measures as the range, the jury's award for future\r\ndamages amounts to between roughly $25,700 per year for eighteen years and $44,500 for ten\r\nyears.  We do not find this award without support or overwhelmed by opposing evidence.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\tBoth sides in this case presented evidence that could support a verdict in their favor. \r\nResolution of such evidentiary clashes is the province of the jury, subject to reversal only if the\r\nappellate court determines that the jury's findings either are supported by no evidence or are\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.

The jury charge does not specify what injury (blindness or disfigurement).\r\n</p><p>2.        Both Ruiz and Bowman are board certified ophthalmologists.  Ruiz holds a chair in\r\nophthalmology at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston.  He subspecializes in\r\nretinas.  He has seen fifty cases of endophthalmitis.  Bowman is an examiner for the\r\nophthalmology certification board.  He subspecializes in corneal diseases and has treated about\r\nseventy patients with endophthalmitis.  Only Ruiz examined Graham, and that was after the\r\nGunderson flap procedure.\r\n</p><p>3.        Wong contends in his reply brief that Graham raises this alternative theory for the first time\r\non appeal.  Graham's third amended petition alleges that Wong \"failed to properly diagnose or\r\ntreat Plaintiff's condition\" without specifying what condition.  At trial, Graham's attorneys\r\ninterrogated witnesses regarding the adequacy of Wong's treatment of uveitis.  In closing\r\narguments, Graham's attorneys discussed whether Wong adequately treated uveitis.\r\n</p><p>4.        Not only did appellants not object to the submitted question, they proposed a question with\r\nthe same lump-sum format (though their request for additional directions preceding the question\r\nwas rejected).\r\n</p><p>5.        Whether Graham can recover that full amount is a separate issue on appeal.\r\n</p><p>6.        Appellants concede that no Texas court has held in a published opinion that Medicare\r\npayments are excluded from the collateral source rule.  They cite Louisiana cases as persuasive\r\nauthority for that proposition.  <em>See Suhor v. Lagasse</em>, 770 So.2d 422 (La. Ct. App. 4th Cir. 2000);\r\n<em>Terrell v. Nanda</em>, 759 So. 2d 1026, 1030-31 (La. Ct. App. 2d Cir. 2000) (addressing Medicaid). \r\nEven if we were persuaded to carve out an exception for past medical expenses, the absence of\r\ncertainty that Medicare or Medicaid will cover future expenses would, in our view, limit the\r\nexception's scope to past medical expenses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\ns intended to compensate for physical pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical\r\nimpairment--damages deemed \"nebulous\" by the supreme court in <em>Murdock</em>.  <em>See</em> 946 S.W.2d at\r\n841.

Though the\r\nsurgery was uneventful, the post-operative period was not.  Graham, who was seventy-three years\r\nold at time of trial, developed a series of problems culminating in his losing all sensitivity to light\r\nin the eye.  His treatment eventually moved to other doctors and culminated with an additional\r\nsurgery--the \"Gunderson flap\" procedure--that he considers disfiguring.  The jury found that\r\nappellants' negligence proximately caused the injury<sup>(1)</sup> to Graham.  It assessed damages for physical\r\npain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical impairment, and medical care at $200,000 in the\r\npast and $462,500 in the future; prejudgment interest increased the past damages judgment to\r\n$248,690.53.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe disputes on appeal concern Wong's responsibility for Graham's current\r\ncondition.  Appellants complain about the erroneous admission and misuse of evidence regarding\r\na lawsuit that Wong filed regarding an unrelated traffic accident.  Appellants also contend that\r\nGraham failed to present legally and factually sufficient evidence to prove cause, proximate cause,\r\nforeseeability, and damages.  Graham contends Wong caused his damages by not treating him\r\nproperly, not making proper notes, and not referring him timely to other physicians.  Graham\r\ncontends that his loss of vision, disfigurement, and suffering all resulted from Wong's\r\ncommissions and omissions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong><center>Evidence of Wong's lawsuit as plaintiff</center></strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe begin by examining appellants' complaint concerning the admission and use of\r\nevidence regarding an unrelated lawsuit.  Graham elicited testimony from Wong regarding a\r\nlawsuit he filed against a driver who rear-ended him.  Wong concedes that the evidence was\r\nadmissible to impeach his credibility; he testified at his deposition that he could not recall being\r\na plaintiff in non-medical lawsuits even though only three months before the deposition he had\r\nfiled the car-wreck suit, claiming that his injuries imperiled his career as a surgeon.  Though there\r\nwas some discussion outside the presence of the jury regarding the purposes for which this\r\ntestimony could be elicited, appellants did not request an instruction limiting the jury's use of the\r\ntestimony.  Evidence admitted without limitation is before the court for all purposes.  Tex. R.\r\nEvid. 105; <em>see Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.

Graham experiences no problem with his vision.  Graham's vision in\r\nhis left eye improves to 20/50 without correction.  His uncorrected vision\r\nin his right eye is 20/60.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\t\tWong also notes that Graham has cataracts in both eyes and entropion with\r\ntrichiasis on his left lower lid; Graham's musculature changed, causing his\r\neyelashes to rub his eye and irritate it.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>September 9, 1997\tGraham's cornea has healed from the pterygium removal.  Graham still has\r\ntrichiasis.  After Graham declines to have surgery to correct the condition,\r\nWong removes the troublesome lashes.  They schedule surgery to remove\r\na cataract from his left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>September 30, 1997\tGraham has a preoperative visit with Wong.  Graham's vision tests at 20/50\r\nin both eyes.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 2, 1997\tWong removes the cataract from Graham's left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 3, 1997\tAt the first post-operative visit, Graham has some corneal edema, corneal\r\nswelling, and decreased vision.  He could count fingers only at one foot. \r\nWong prescribed a topical steroid for use three times a day.  They set an\r\nappointment for cataract removal from the right eye on October 16,\r\ncontingent on improvement in the left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 8, 1997\tGraham's eye is slightly improved and the cornea is clearing.  Wong\r\ndecreases the frequency of the steroid application to twice daily, but cancels\r\nthe October 16 surgery.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 22, 1997\tGraham's sight is slightly improved.  He can count fingers two feet away. \r\nHis left eye has keratic precipitates with a pupillary membrane, indicating\r\ninflammation in the anterior chamber.  Wong notes moderately severe\r\nuveitis, a non-infectious inflammation.  Wong concludes that an infection\r\nin the eye, endophthalmitis, is possible, but not probable.  To combat the\r\nincreased inflammation, Wong increases the frequency of the steroid\r\napplication to every waking hour and prescribes an eye-muscle relaxant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>October 27, 1997\tGraham's caretaker, Brenda Farrar, calls Wong's office to report that\r\nGraham's eye hurts and is red and draining; she requests something\r\nstronger for the pain.  The staff tells Graham to come in as soon as\r\npossible.  Wong's son, a board-certified ophthalmologist and Austin Eye\r\nClinic employee, calls a refill of the eye-drop prescription and leaves a\r\nmessage for Farrar that she need not bring Graham in for an office visit.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>November 4, 1997\tWong examines Graham and notes that Graham's eye had foreign body\r\nsensation, corneal edema, a fibrous pupillary membrane, and hypopyon--an\r\naccumulation of white blood cells in the anterior chamber.  Graham could\r\nno longer count fingers, but could detect hand motion.  Wong again\r\ndiscounts the probability of endophthalmitis and concludes that Graham has\r\nsinusitis, for which he prescribes ampicillin.  He continues the dosage of\r\nthe eye drops and the muscle relaxant.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>November 12, 1997\tWong refills prescriptions for ampicillin, eye drops, and muscle relaxants.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>November 25, 1997\tGraham's vision and condition are essentially unchanged.  Wong diagnoses\r\npostoperative uveitis of undetermined etiology.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>December 3, 1997\tGraham skips an appointment.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>December 16, 1997\tIn addition to the previously noted symptoms, Wong notes keratitis with\r\ncorneal deepithelialization.  Because topical steroids retard\r\nreepithelialization, Wong reduces eyedrop dosage to four times daily,\r\ncontinuing the drops to treat the inflammation.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>January 13, 1998\tGraham's corneal ulcer is infected, the inflammation is worse, and vision\r\nis reduced to light perception only.  His pain, redness, and discharge are\r\nworse.  Wong refers Graham to Brian Berger, a retinal specialist.  Wong\r\nconfers by telephone with Berger and faxes him Graham's records.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\t\tBerger examines Graham, performing an ultrasound and an anterior\r\nchamber tap.  The ultrasound does not indicate endophthalmitis, nor does\r\nthe tap produce a bacterial culture; Berger concludes that endophthalmitis\r\nis very unlikely, and ascribes Graham's symptoms to the corneal ulcer.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>January 14, 1998\tGraham still has light perception only.  Wong diagnoses a corneal ulcer\r\nwith hypopyon.  This is Graham's final visit to Wong.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Graham sought treatment from other doctors.  The corneal ulcer had almost perforated his eye. \r\nThe new doctors eventually performed a Gunderson flap procedure, which involves pulling the\r\nconjunctiva, the mucus layer of the eye, over the cornea.  The procedure saved his eye, but not\r\nits vision; Graham has no light perception in his left eye.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p><strong>Specific contentions of insufficiency</strong>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants submit many reasons that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient.  They argue Graham did not show that they were responsible for his damages; that\r\nis, he did not show reasonable medical probability of proximate causation and foreseeability. \r\nThey also argue that he failed to segregate which damages, if any, resulted from appellants' care. \r\nThey further argue that the evidence does not support the amount of damages awarded.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tGraham's theory of the case is that appellants caused his loss of vision by not\r\nadequately diagnosing and treating his condition.  He contends that Wong should have diagnosed\r\nendophthalmitis and treated him or referred him for treatment based on that diagnosis. \r\nAlternatively he argues that the only possible other cause was uveitis, which Wong failed to\r\nadequately diagnose and treat or refer him for that condition.  He contends that his loss of vision\r\nis a foreseeable result of the inadequate treatment.  Graham contends that the evidence was legally\r\nand factually sufficient to support every necessary element.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<strong><em>Causation and foreseeability of loss of light perception.  </em></strong>Graham's experts, C.\r\nBradley Bowman and Richard Ruiz both testified that Graham's loss of vision resulted from\r\nundiagnosed endophthalmitis.<sup>(2)</sup>  They agreed that, following cataract surgery, infection should be\r\na primary concern, particularly when the post-operative patient shows unexpectedly severe\r\ninflammation or pain.  They testified that endophthalmitis must be a leading diagnosis until ruled\r\nout because untreated infections will lead to loss of vision; early treatment is critical.  Ruiz\r\ntestified that Wong should have taken a culture of Graham's vitreous and injected antibiotics into\r\nhis eye on October 22 even before the culture results returned.  Ruiz said oral and topical\r\nantibiotics do not get adequate concentrations into the eye.  Bowman, Ruiz, and James Everett\r\nKey, II testified that pupillary membranes like Graham developed are mainly or likely caused by\r\nendophthalmitis.  They pointed to other signs of infection such as impaired vision and keratic\r\nprecipitates--clumps of white blood cells next to the cornea.  Bowman testified that by January the\r\nproblems at the front of the eye, possibly caused by too lengthy use of steroid eye drops, misled\r\nBerger and precluded him from visually inspecting the back of the eye where the infection was\r\ndestroying Graham's vision.  Bowman discounts the results of Berger's ultrasound and anterior\r\neye tap, asserting (with Berger's agreement) that ultrasounds often fail to diagnose endophthalmitis\r\nand that the anterior tap is less likely to show an infection of the vitreous at the back of the eye. \r\nBerger and Ruiz agreed that suspected endophthalmitis cases cause positive cultures for bacteria\r\nonly about half the time; Ruiz said anterior aqueous taps are even less accurate.  Berger also\r\nconceded that topical steroids like Graham was using can mask signs of infection for short periods\r\nof time.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBowman testified that diagnosing uveitis before ruling out endophthalmitis is below\r\nthe standard of care.  He testified that uveitis in a post-operative cataract patient would be\r\nextraordinarily coincidental; he also testified that a patient whose eye was as nonresponsive to\r\nuveitis treatment as Graham's eye should have gotten much more extensive testing and treatment\r\nby November.  Bowman said that cases in which uveitis led to total vision loss were\r\nextraordinarily rare; neither he nor Wong had seen a patient lose all light perception as a result\r\nof uveitis.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tBowman and Ruiz were also critical of administrative aspects of Wong's treatment\r\nof Graham.  They testified that Wong should have seen Graham more frequently than every two\r\nto three weeks; Ruiz described this frequency as \"woefully inadequate.\"  Between the October\r\nsurgery and the January referral to Berger, Wong did not perform diagnostic tests, change the eye\r\ndrops (other than the frequency of dosage), see Graham more frequently than two week intervals\r\n(though at least one of the gaps was due to Graham's no-show at appointment), call another\r\ndoctor, or refer him to another doctor.  Bowman and Ruiz testified that Wong's records were\r\nsubpar, failing to note complaints of pain.  Bowman was particularly bothered by the absence from\r\nthe charts of a telephone message taken by Austin Eye Clinic Association staff from Graham's\r\ncaretaker requesting more pain medication because Graham was \"still\" in pain--indicating present\r\nand past pain which Bowman felt was not adequately recorded in the charts.  Berger noted that\r\nGraham had a three-day history of pain.  Bowman testified that the lack of consistent pain notation\r\nmisled Berger into believing that Graham's pain and problems in January arose from the corneal\r\nulcer.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThough Graham primarily contends that he suffered from untreated\r\nendophthalmitis, he contends alternatively that Wong did not adequately treat him for uveitis.<sup>(3)</sup>\r\nUveitis, however, should respond to topical steroids.  Bowman testified that it should have cleared\r\nwithin three to five days following the October 22 visit when Wong increased the eyedrop dose\r\nto hourly.  It did not.  Instead, it worsened.  Graham's condition was worse than any of the\r\ntestifying doctors had seen in a post-operative cataract patient.  Nevertheless, Wong did not use\r\nthe more aggressive treatments (full work-up, chest x-ray, blood tests, other modes of steroid\r\ndelivery, and more frequent examinations) that Bowman testified were the standard of care for\r\nnonresponsive uveitis.  Though Wong may have reasonably not given Graham oral steroids\r\nbecause of the potential side effects, Berger testified that persistent uveitis can be treated with\r\nsteroid ointments and steroid injections near the eye to avoid the systemic side effects of oral\r\nsteroids.  Berger agreed that Graham should have been examined more frequently because he was\r\nnot responding to treatment.  Ruiz agreed that Wong's treatment of Graham was completely\r\ninadequate if the condition was uveitis.  He agreed that uveitis could have caused the vision loss.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWong testified he did nothing inappropriate that led to Graham's vision loss.  He\r\nconcluded that Graham did not have endophthalmitis and diagnosed Graham's highly abnormal\r\npost-operative condition as uveitis; Berger and Key agreed that endophthalmitis was highly\r\nunlikely.  Wong treated Graham with steroid eyedrops.  He testified that he or his staff would have\r\nwritten down a complaint of pain had Graham voiced it; in fact, Wong or his staff noted on the\r\ncharts more than once that Graham was suffering either pain or foreign body sensation.  Berger's\r\nJanuary examination revealed that Graham's eye was \"quiet\"--it lacked the level of inflammation\r\nconsonant with infection of the vitreous.  He tapped the anterior part of the eye because that is the\r\nportion in which his examination showed hypopyon (pus).  Both the ultrasound and the tap showed\r\nno infection.  Key testified that Graham lost his eyesight to persistent uveitis ocular inflammation. \r\nKey testified that Graham did not respond to any type of therapy so there was no indication\r\nwhether more aggressive treatment would have helped.  Wong agreed with that assessment,\r\ntestifying that ninety-nine percent of patients would have healed from the ulcer; even aggressive\r\nantibiotic treatment did not heal the ulcer until the Gunderson flap procedure.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThere was also evidence that Graham was not the most diligent in obtaining care.\r\nHe may not have communicated his complaints clearly.  He reported that he did not always\r\nadminister the eyedrops with the frequency Wong prescribed.  He may have abraded his cornea\r\nwith eyelashes or a paper towel.  More than once, whether due to transportation difficulties or\r\nother reasons, he prolonged the gap between office visits slightly beyond the three weeks Wong\r\nrecommended. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants also argue that, if there is blame, perhaps Berger or subsequent treating\r\ndoctors should bear at least some of it.  Graham could perceive the difference between light and\r\ndarkness when Wong referred him to Berger, and yet Graham lost even that perception after the\r\nreferral.  With the exception of the October phone message regarding pain, Berger had the same\r\ninformation from Wong that Bowman used in formulating his opinion, yet agreed with Wong's\r\nrejection of endophthalmitis after two examinations of Graham.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe conclude that legally and factually sufficient evidence support the jury's\r\nfindings that appellants proximately caused Graham's total loss of vision and that such loss was\r\nforeseeable.  Evidence supported a conclusion that either untreated endophthalmitis or mistreated\r\nuveitis caused Graham's vision loss and that neither a corneal ulcer nor macular degeneration\r\nwould result in loss of light perception.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWong agreed that \"it's more likely than not that [a patient] will lose sight and go\r\nto no light perception in an untreated infection in the eye.\"  Endophthalmitis is a risk following\r\ncataract surgery.  Graham exhibited the hallmarks of endophthalmitis from the outset of the post-operative period:  pain, inflammation, and decreased vision.  There was evidence that appellants'\r\nfrequency of examination, diagnosis, charting, and treatment were below the standard of care. \r\nThough Wong considered infection at every examination, he waited three months before taking\r\nadditional steps to rule out infection despite the poor condition of Graham's eye.  Graham never\r\nreceived the intraocular injection of antibiotics--the standard of care for endophthalmitis--that\r\nroutinely wipe out almost all bacteria in the eye.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIf Graham's condition was uveitis, evidence supports a finding that appellants' care\r\nwas inadequate; despite Graham's nonresponsiveness to treatment, appellants neither significantly\r\naltered his treatment nor increased the frequency of examination.  There also was evidence that\r\nWong's charts did not include all the necessary elements and that a telephoned complaint of\r\npersistent pain was not included in the information transmitted to Berger.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThough Graham may have had some light perception when referred to Berger, there\r\nwas evidence that Graham's corneal ulcer (which evidence supports finding was caused or\r\nworsened by the long-term use of steroid eyedrops), coupled with Wong's spotty charting, led\r\nBerger to focus on the ulcer.  Evidence supports a finding that the severity of the ulcer left\r\nsubsequent doctors with no reasonable choice but to perform the Gunderson flap.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMore than a scintilla of evidence supports the findings that Graham's loss of vision\r\nwas foreseeable and was proximately caused by appellants' actions and omissions; the evidence\r\nis not so weak or so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong\r\nand unjust.  The existence of expert testimony controverting other expert testimony presents a\r\nchoice for the jury to make, but does not require reversal.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<strong><em>Causation and foreseeability of disfigurement.</em></strong>  Similarly, sufficient evidence\r\nsupports findings that Graham's disfigurement was foreseeable and proximately caused by Wong's\r\ntreatment of the ulcer.  The disfigurement is a result of the deteriorated condition of the eye and\r\nthe Gunderson flap procedure.  Wong first noted deepithelialization on December 16.  He reduced\r\nthe frequency of use of topical steroid eyedrops from hourly to four times daily.  Records from\r\na January 21 examination show that an abrasion on the cornea came from wiping with a paper\r\ntowel.  Though admitting that an eye ulcer could potentially progress exactly as Graham's had\r\nwith proper treatment, Bowman testified that Wong's treatment of the ulcer probably led to the\r\ndisfiguring surgery.  Bowman testified that \"the continued use of steroids without appropriate\r\nantibiotic treatment could have caused and <em>probably caused </em>this ulcer to become worse because\r\nit wasn't treated appropriately.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Berger agreed that hourly application of\r\nsteroid eyedrops foreseeably increases the risk of a corneal ulcer.  Ruiz testified that continuing\r\nthe use of the topical steroids after finding the ulcer made it worse.  He and Bowman said that the\r\nstandard of care required taking a culture of the eye, stopping the steroid eye drop, and starting\r\nan antibiotic eyedrop--none of which Wong did.  The steroids would cause the eye surface to thin\r\nto near perforation.  The dramatic thinning of the eye caused the subsequent doctors to perform\r\nthe Gunderson flap procedure to save the eye, resulting in the disfigurement about which Graham\r\ncomplains.  Legally and factually sufficient evidence supports the conclusion that appellants\r\nforeseeably and proximately caused the disfigurement.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<em><strong>Damages.</strong></em>  Appellants' remaining issues concern damages.  Appellants contend that\r\ninsufficient evidence supported a link between their conduct and Graham's loss of vision and\r\ndamages.  They also contend that insufficient evidence supports the amount of damages.  We first\r\nwill examine the sufficiency of the link between appellants' treatment and the damages awarded\r\nto Graham.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<u><em>Segregation</em></u>.  Appellants first complain that Graham failed to segregate the damages\r\ncaused by appellants from damages caused by other persons and other factors.  The damage award\r\nwas made in response to a broad-form question asking for a single sum to compensate for physical\r\npain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical impairment, and medical care; the question\r\nrequested separate amounts for past damages and future damages.  Appellants complain about the\r\nproof of the damages, not the form of the question.<sup>(4)</sup>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tA plaintiff must prove that the negligent actions for which the plaintiff sues\r\nnecessitated the medical expenses for which the plaintiff seeks recovery.  <em>Texarkana Memorial\r\nHosp., Inc. v.

The jury awarded $250,000 to the decedent's estate (not appealed) and\r\n$500,000 to the decedent's mother for medical expenses out of a total bill of $748,710.44. <em> Id.</em> \r\nThe supreme court held that the court of appeals could not properly have held the jury's award was\r\nsupported by factually sufficient evidence because the plaintiffs had not introduced evidence about\r\nwhich treatments addressed the malpractice-induced condition; the supreme court rejected the\r\nargument that the jury's paring of the requested award showed they deducted charges for\r\ntreatments not resulting from the negligence.  <em>Id.</em> at 840.  The supreme court held that a plaintiff\r\nmust provide expert medical testimony to explain what medical procedures treated the negligently\r\ncreated condition.  <em>Id</em>. at 841.  The court wrote that medical expenses were susceptible to such\r\ndetailed proof, unlike \"nebulous measures of damages such as pain and suffering where the jury\r\nhas broad discretion when fixing an amount to award.\"  <em>Id</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tA significant distinction between <em>Murdock</em> and this appeal is the nature of the\r\ndamages challenged.  The <em>Murdock</em> appeal concerned only the medical expenses award, but\r\nmedical expenses in this case were at most $10,545.74<sup>(5)</sup> of the $200,000 past damage award.  This\r\ndamage award is thus much less susceptible of quantification than the award in <em>Murdock</em>.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAnother distinction is that the contribution from sources of injury other than the\r\ndefendants' negligence is less than in <em>Murdock</em>.  In that case, the decedent suffered from many\r\ncongenital problems besides those arising from the hospital's negligence.  The medical expenses\r\ncould be divided between the treatments for the negligence-induced condition and the congenital\r\nproblems.  Here, all damages flow from the disfigurement of and loss of light perception in\r\nGraham's left eye.  We have concluded above that sufficient evidence supports a finding that\r\ninadequacies in appellants' treatment of Graham, their monitoring of his condition, and their\r\ncharting of his progress was a cause of both injuries.  That finding was not overwhelmed by\r\nevidence regarding other possible sources of injury such as Graham's poor healing ability, Graham\r\nscratching his cornea with a tissue, macular degeneration, and treatment by other doctors.  All\r\nthese had countervailing considerations.  Testimony that Graham was a bad healer was blunted by\r\nthe lack of more aggressive or different treatments in the early stages; the only certainty is that\r\nGraham did not respond well to the treatments given.  Regardless of the ulcer's cause, there was\r\nevidence that treatment of the eye's problems (particularly the continued use of steroid eye drops)\r\nprevented healing of the ulcer.  The only evidence of macular degeneration in his left eye was that\r\nhe had it in his right eye (the ramifications of that for his left eye were disputed); macular\r\ndegeneration undisputedly had not robbed and would not rob Graham of light perception in his\r\nright eye.  Though Graham might have recovered some sight when referred to other doctors, there\r\nis evidence that appellants' previous treatment of Graham and charting inadequacies frustrated that\r\npossibility.  Thus, the jury reasonably could have found that all of the measures of Graham's\r\ninjuries flowed from appellants' treatment of him.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tFurther, if sufficient evidence connects appellants to the injuries, we must presume\r\nthat the jury followed its instructions and awarded damages only for injuries caused by appellants'\r\nnegligence.  <em>See Turner, Collie &amp; Braden, Inc. v.

In <em>Phillips</em>, the\r\nsupreme court affirmed an appellate court's rendition of an attorney's fees award in addition to\r\nthe actual damages award.  The supreme court rejected the defendant's argument that the jury must\r\nhave included the attorney's fee award as part of the plaintiff's damages, writing the following:\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>The trial court properly did not ask the jury to include in its determination of\r\nMartha's actual damages a reasonable fee for legal services necessary to her\r\nprosecution of the case.  <em>See Hammonds v. Hammonds</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1666237\"><a href=\"/opinion/1666237/hammonds-v-hammonds/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span>, 605 (1958).  We must assume that the jury followed the trial court's\r\ninstructions and answered the question put to them.  <em>See Turner, Collie &amp; Braden\r\nv. Brookhollow, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1798395\"><a href=\"/opinion/1798395/turner-collie-braden-v-brookhollow-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">642</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span>, 167 (Tex.1982).  Given that assumption,\r\nwe must conclude that the jury's answer of $300,000 to the trial court's question\r\ndid not include attorney fees.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Harry argues that, logically, the jury must have arrived at their $300,000 finding\r\nby adding $37,585 accounting fees which Martha testified she incurred to the\r\nstipulated $250,000 in attorney fees.  However plausible Harry's explanation of the\r\njury's reasoning process may be, it cannot substitute for the jury's finding.  What\r\nthe jury found, not why the jury found it, is the relevant inquiry absent jury\r\nmisconduct.  <em>First Nat'l Bank v. Zimmerman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1762251\"><a href=\"/opinion/1762251/first-national-bank-in-dallas-v-zimmerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span>, 678 (Tex.1969). \r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p><em>Id</em>.  Here, the jury was asked first if appellants' negligence caused Graham's injury, then what sum\r\nof money would fairly compensate Graham for injuries that resulted from the occurrence in\r\nquestion.  If sufficient evidence supports the award, we must presume that the jury followed the\r\ncourt's instructions and excluded damages, if any, caused by other sources.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t<u><em>Elements of damages</em></u>.  We will examine the evidence regarding the elements of the\r\ndamage award:  disfigurement, impairment, physical pain and mental anguish, and medical care.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence supports an award for disfigurement.  Disfigurement is that\r\nwhich impairs or injures the beauty, symmetry, or appearance of a person by rendering him\r\nunsightly, misshapen, imperfect, or deformed.  <em>See Transit Management Co. v. Sanchez</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529384\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529384/transit-mgt-co-of-laredo-v-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span>, 826 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1994, no writ).  The damages compensate for the\r\nsuffering, including humiliation, induced in the mind of the injured party by contemplating his\r\nchanged physical condition.  <em>See Houston Lighting &amp; Power v. Reed</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2398620\"><a href=\"/opinion/2398620/houston-lighting-power-company-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (Tex.\r\nCiv. App.--Houston 1963, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  As discussed above, during appellants' three months\r\nof treatment, Graham's eye was inflamed and oozing pus; sufficient evidence showed appellants'\r\ntreatments were inadequate.  Now, the eye is dim and somewhat shriveled.  Appellants argue that\r\nthey did not perform the Gunderson flap that permanently altered his eye, and point to Graham's\r\ndeposition testimony that his feelings had not changed since the surgery.  As discussed above,\r\nhowever, evidence supports a finding that the Gunderson flap procedure was the inexorable result\r\nof appellants' negligence--the other option was rupture of the eye.  One of Graham's caretakers\r\nsaid that Graham's remarkably blue eyes were his one source of vanity, and that now he is\r\nembarrassed for anyone to see his eye because he thinks he looks like a rooster pecked out his eye. \r\nIn trial, he described his eye as disgraceful.  Further, the jury saw Graham's eye for eight days\r\nand could judge for itself whether the eye was disfigured.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence showed that Graham's loss of vision and disfigurement\r\nconstricted his range of activities.  Damages for impairment may be awarded for restriction of\r\nactivities, but the limitation must be distinct from other damage measures such as pain and lost\r\nincome; examples include limitations on the ability to mow lawns, engage in strenuous tasks,\r\ndrive, walk without assistance, perform routine car maintenance, or play recreational sports. \r\n<em>Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Harlow</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443528\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443528/southern-pacific-transp-co-v-harlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 950 (Tex. App.--Corpus Christi 1987,\r\nwrit denied).  Appellants argue that Graham's activities were curtailed before the surgery, pointing\r\nto the fact that his mother willed her property to some younger people on condition that they care\r\nfor him for his life.  They also note Graham's continued ability to cook and clean inside his home\r\nas evidence that he is not impaired.  There was evidence, however, that the loss of vision has\r\nlimited his activities.  Before his surgery, he played the fiddle, changed watch batteries, cleaned\r\nup his yard, took trash to a dump, mowed, repaired lawnmowers and a tractor, and fed cattle.  He\r\ndrove himself five miles to Marble Falls and ran errands; for longer trips, he depended on others\r\neven before the surgery.  He hunted, plowed and cut a field of maize, helped install a deer fence,\r\nwalked the ranch to find newborn calves, and walked to visit friends; all of this involved walking\r\nover uneven ground.  Now, however, his lack of depth perception and vision severely limits his\r\nactivities.  He no longer plays the fiddle because he cannot see adequately to string it.  He has\r\ntrouble getting around in unfamiliar places.  He loses his balance and falls, so he is extremely\r\nreluctant to go outside his home.  He no longer helps with outside chores or drives himself\r\nanywhere.  Sufficient evidence supports an award for impairment.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence also supports Graham's complaints of pain.  Though he had\r\ndays without pain during his treatment by appellants, his eye was inflamed for more than three\r\nmonths.  Graham also complained of a dull ache behind his eye.  It eventually oozed pus.  The\r\nlack of improvement and deterioration of his condition have been linked to appellants' treatment\r\nof him.  Wong prescribed pain medications in addition to over-the-counter pain medications.  Loss\r\nof depth perception from his loss of vision caused him to fall and suffer scrapes and bruises. \r\nDuring trial, Graham showed an injury from such a fall.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSufficient evidence also supports Graham's claims of mental anguish.  To sustain\r\nsuch a claim, the record must contain evidence of substantial disruption of daily routine or a high\r\ndegree of mental pain and distress that is more than mere worry, anxiety, vexation,\r\nembarrassment, or anger.  <em>Parkway Co. v. Woodruff</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2454480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2454480/parkway-co-v-woodruff/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 444 (Tex. 1995). \r\nAppellants tout Graham's deposition testimony that nothing about his feelings or mental health had\r\nchanged.  At trial, however, he testified that his eye's condition ruined his life.  Others testified\r\nthat he seemed depressed.  One of his caretakers testified that Graham said she might as well\r\nknock him over the head, that his life was over because he could not see.  This experience makes\r\nhim fearful of medical care in general, and adamant against surgery to treat the cataract in his right\r\neye.  He is afraid to walk outside and does not like people to see his eye despite reassurances that\r\nthe eye is not repulsive.  That fear and embarrassment play roles in the restriction of his activity\r\nshows his confinement has a mental component.  Though some of the evidence advanced by\r\nGraham (i.e., worries about being sent to a nursing home if something happened to his caretakers)\r\nmay not be severe enough or tied closely enough to these injuries to be compensable, anxiety and\r\ndepression that leave a previously active man essentially homebound, embarrassed to be seen in\r\npublic, fearful of medical treatment, and opining that his life is over show a substantial disruption\r\nof his daily routine and a high degree of mental strain.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAppellants' challenge to the evidence of medical expenses is somewhat different. \r\nThe district court admitted Graham's evidence of his medical bills based on Bowman's testimony\r\nthat the charges were reasonable and necessary.  Appellants contended that some of the charges\r\nwere neither reasonable nor necessary because Medicare paid reduced charges and appellants could\r\nnot collect the difference from anyone; thus, they argued, Graham cannot recover that which was\r\nnever paid.  The district court refused to admit appellants' evidence of the reduced Medicare\r\npayments, but allowed appellants to make an offer of proof.  On appeal, appellants challenge, not\r\nthe exclusion of their evidence, but the reasonableness and necessity of the expenses awarded.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tEvidence of the Medicare payments and reductions are a collateral source of\r\npayment, one that the court did not have to admit.  The collateral source rule is a long-standing\r\ntenet of Texas law that the defendant should not get the benefit of payment arrangements that\r\nmight reduce or eliminate plaintiff's out-of-pocket expenses. <em>See City of Fort Worth v.

As discussed above, evidence supports a finding that Graham's post-operative\r\ncondition was worsened by inadequate medical care, prompting these medical expenses.  Even if\r\nGraham caused the initial scratch of his cornea, sufficient evidence supports finding that\r\nappellants' treatment exacerbated the injury.\r\n\r\n</p><p><strong>\t<em>Damage totals.</em></strong>  The jury has wide latitude in determining the amount of a personal\r\ninjury damage award.  <em>Baptist Memorial Hosp.

As discussed above, almost ninety percent (and perhaps more) of the past damages\r\naward was intended to compensate for physical pain and mental anguish, disfigurement, physical\r\nimpairment--damages deemed \"nebulous\" by the supreme court in <em>Murdock</em>.  <em>See</em> 946 S.W.2d at\r\n841.  Graham suffered pain during treatment and continues to injure himself because of the result\r\nof that treatment.  He was and remains disfigured.  His activities were restricted by both his\r\nimpairment and the mental anguish associated with it.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tNor do we perceive a basis on which we can overturn or reduce the $462,500 award\r\nfor future damages.  Though Graham may not suffer as much pain and medical expenses in the\r\nfuture as a result of his treatment by appellants, his impairment and disfigurement will continue,\r\nas will his resulting mental anguish.  Appellants' suggestion that he could possibly get a cornea\r\ntransplant at most shifts the damages.  Assuming appellant overcame his dread of medical\r\nprocedures caused by his previous treatment, the transplant definitely would increase his future\r\nmedical expenses and would decrease his other damages only if the procedure worked; and some\r\nwitnesses doubted that the vision in or appearance of Graham's left eye could ever be improved. \r\nGraham's statistical life expectancy at time of trial was 10.4 years, but his mother lived eighteen\r\nyears beyond his age at trial.

The jury charge does not specify what injury (blindness or disfigurement).\r\n</p><p>2.        Both Ruiz and Bowman are board certified ophthalmologists.

Bowman is an examiner for the\r\nophthalmology certification board.  He subspecializes in corneal diseases and has treated about\r\nseventy patients with endophthalmitis.  Only Ruiz examined Graham, and that was after the\r\nGunderson flap procedure.\r\n</p><p>3.        Wong contends in his reply brief that Graham raises this alternative theory for the first time\r\non appeal.  Graham's third amended petition alleges that Wong \"failed to properly diagnose or\r\ntreat Plaintiff's condition\" without specifying what condition.  At trial, Graham's attorneys\r\ninterrogated witnesses regarding the adequacy of Wong's treatment of uveitis.  In closing\r\narguments, Graham's attorneys discussed whether Wong adequately treated uveitis.\r\n</p><p>4.
