Brown v. Board\nof Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 490 (1954) (\"Brown I\"). During the twenty\nyears following the Supreme Court's mandate, the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education (\"CMS\" or the\"Board\") resisted all\nefforts to expedite desegregation, essentially arguing that, in light of\nthe centuries over which the dual system of education had come to\nfruition, the Board would need a proportional period of time to\ndevelop remedies aimed at correcting past wrongs. Faced with this\nintransigence, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in 1971 that\nthe Constitution required the Board to take affirmative measures,\nincluding the use of race-based ratios in student assignment, to eradi-\ncate vestiges of its invidious discrimination. See Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1 (1971).\n\nFinally, in 1975, the Board began seeking to fulfill the Supreme\nCourt's mandate that public schools be desegregated with \"all deliber-\nate speed.\" Brown v. Board of Educ., 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955)\n(\"Brown II\"). Today, with the Board having had less than twenty-six\nyears to implement appropriate remedies, we must decide whether the\ntask of desegregating the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools has reached\nits end.\n\nWe hold that it has not. Over the Board's own admission to the\ncontrary, the district court concluded that the school system had\nachieved unitary status across the board. While the district court made\nfindings sufficient to hold that CMS had achieved unitary status in\nsome respects, the court failed to adequately explore the return of pre-\ndominantly one-race schools as a vestige of segregation, rendering its\nfindings insufficient to conclude that CMS has achieved unitary status\nin every respect.\n\nIn an equally unprecedented ruling, the district court held that the\nschool system, although operating under court orders to desegregate\n\n                  6\n\fits schools, violated the Constitution by employing a magnet school\nprogram that considered race in student assignment. On the contrary,\nbecause the Board's expanded magnet schools program -- and the\nrace-sensitive method of student selection it employed -- was\nundertaken both to remedy the effects of past segregation and to com-\nply with governing court orders, they did not and could not violate the\nConstitution.\n\nIn this appeal, we consider the above rulings along with a number\nof related issues. As explained below, we affirm in part, reverse in\npart, vacate in part, and remand this case for further proceedings.\n\nI.\n\nA.\n\nIn order to better understand the issues presented in this case, we\nmust briefly review our country's history of school desegregation liti-\ngation, in which CMS has played a prominent role.\n\nEven after slavery had been abolished for almost a full century,\nAfrican-American children were, for the most part, either excluded\nfrom the public schools or educated separately from white children.\n\"In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some\nstates.\" Brown I, 347 U.S. at 490; see also Martin v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 475 F. Supp. 1319, 1324 (W.D.N.C. 1979)\n(\"For three centuries racial segregation was the law of the land.\").\nIndeed, throughout the early part of the 1900s, CMS operated a segre-\ngated school system within the safe harbor created by the Supreme\nCourt's doctrine of \"separate but equal\" articulated in Plessy v. Fergu-\nson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896).\n\nIn the middle of the 1900s, the Supreme Court began dismantling\nthe great wall of segregation constructed under the imprimatur of\nPlessy. The Court initially sought to determine whether various \"sepa-\nrate\" African-American schools were genuinely \"equal\" to white\nschools by evaluating the quality of physical facilities, curricula, fac-\nulty, and certain \"intangible\" considerations. See, e.g., Sweatt v.\nPainter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950); Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of\n\n                   7\n\fOkla., 332 U.S. 631 (1948). In each instance, the Court concluded\nthat they were not. Id.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court at last overruled Plessy, declaring that\n\"in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal'\nhas no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\"\nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 495. Just one year later, the Court mandated that\nfederal courts and school authorities take affirmative steps to achieve\ndesegregation. Brown II, 349 U.S. at 299. Specifically, federal courts\nwere to retain jurisdiction over desegregation cases during the period\nof transition, wielding their equitable powers to supervise school\nboards' efforts to effectuate integration. Id. at 300-01. One of the\nmost important obligations of the federal courts was to ensure that\nschool boards were proceeding in good faith to desegregate the public\nschools \"with all deliberate speed.\" Id. at 301. With these seminal\ndecisions -- Brown I and Brown II-- the Supreme Court promised\nthe citizens of this country, and particularly African-American chil-\ndren, school systems \"in which all vestiges of enforced racial segrega-\ntion have been eliminated.\" Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia,\n407 U.S. 451, 463 (1972).\n\nNotwithstanding the Court's repeated admonition that segregation\nand its vestiges be eliminated \"root and branch,\" Green v. County Sch.\nBd. of New Kent County, 391 U.S. 430, 437-48 (1968), many school\nboards -- CMS included -- adopted \"an all too familiar\" response to\nthe mandate of Brown II, interpreting \"all deliberate speed\" \"as giving\nlatitude to delay steps to desegregate.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S.\n467, 472 (1992). And so, lower federal courts, with the guidance and\noversight of the Supreme Court, began fashioning equitable remedies\nto contend with school board recalcitrance. For example, in Green,\nthe Supreme Court held that a \"freedom of choice\" plan, which per-\nmitted students -- regardless of race -- to choose the school they\nwould attend, was by itself insufficient to meet the mandate of Brown.\n391 U.S. at 430. In so holding, the Court recognized that more inten-\nsive efforts would be necessary in order to make \"meaningful and\nimmediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segrega-\ntion.\" Id. at 439. Subsequently, in this very case, the Court approved\nsignificant federal court intervention into a school system in order to\neliminate segregation \"root and branch,\" including the busing of stu-\ndents from schools close to their homes to schools farther away, the\n\n                  8\n\fuse of race-based \"mathematical ratios,\" and the alteration of student\nattendance zones. Swann, 402 U.S. at 15, 25, 28, 30-31.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made clear, however, that a federal court's\n\"end purpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to\nrestore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that\nis operating in compliance with the Constitution.\" Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 489. Hence, as a school system eliminates the vestiges of past offi-\ncial segregation from certain facets of its operations, courts possess\nthe authority to relinquish supervision in a commensurate fashion. Id.\nat 489-91.\n\nIn this context, we examine the steps taken by CMS to eliminate\nthe vestiges of segregation.\n\nB.\n\n1.\n\nNorth Carolina's most significant initial response to the mandate of\nBrown II was the \"Pupil Assignment Act of 1955-56, under which\n[the Board had] the sole power to assign pupils to schools, and chil-\ndren [were] required to attend the schools to which they [were]\nassigned.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F.\nSupp. 1358, 1361 (W.D.N.C. 1969). This was an ineffectual measure\n-- perhaps intentionally so -- and by 1964, no more than a few dozen\n(out of more than 20,000) African-American children in CMS were\nattending schools with white children. Id. at 1362.\n\n2.\n\nIn 1965, the parents of African-American children attending CMS\n(hereinafter the \"Swann plaintiffs\")11 filed a class action seeking\ninjunctive relief, claiming that the Board's policies and practices were\nperpetuating a segregated school system. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 243 F. Supp. 667, 668 (W.D.N.C. 1965).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 Since this case was first filed in 1965, the various successor plaintiffs\nhave been referred to as the Swann plaintiffs, a practice we continue to\nobserve here.\n\n                   9\n\fOn July 14, 1965, the district court approved a Board-proposed plan\nthat closed certain black schools, built new schools, and established\nschool attendance zones based on neighborhoods. But the linchpin of\nthis plan was its grant of permission to each student -- regardless of\nrace -- to freely transfer to a different school (often described as a\n\"freedom of choice\" plan). Id. In approving this plan, the district court\nheld that CMS had no affirmative duty to \"increase the mixing of the\nraces\"; instead, the Board's obligation under Brown II, according to\nthe court, was to act without the intent to perpetuate segregation. Id.\nat 670. The following year, this Court affirmed the district court's\ninterpretation of Brown II. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 369 F.2d 29, 32 (4th Cir. 1966) (\"Whatever the Board may\ndo in response to its own initiative or that of the community, we have\nheld that there is no constitutional requirement that it act with the con-\nscious purpose of achieving the maximum mixture of the races in the\nschool population.\").\n\nHowever, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in\nGreen, which struck down a desegregation plan founded predomi-\nnantly on \"freedom of choice,\" it became clear that school boards did\npossess an affirmative obligation to desegregate, not merely an obli-\ngation to implement race-neutral policies. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\nInvigorated by the developing law, the Swann plaintiffs promptly\nfiled a motion for further relief with the district court, seeking to\nexpedite the desegregation process.\n\n3.\n\nIn 1969, Judge James B. McMillan, newly assigned to the Swann\ncase,2\n     2 reexamined the Board's actions in light of Green and deter-\nmined that its \"freedom of choice\" plan, when coupled with geo-\ngraphic zoning, were \"not furthering desegregation.\" 300 F. Supp. at\n1372. On the fundamental matters of assigning students and faculty,\nand the siting of new schools, the court made the following findings:\n\n- Student assignment: The court noted that a ratio of seventy percent\n        white students to thirty percent black students, which approxi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 For clarity's sake, we will often refer within to the presiding district\njudge by name.\n\n                  10\n\f       mated the ratio of white to black students in the county, tended to\n       aid \"better students [in holding] their pace, with substantial\n       improvement for the poorer students.\" Id. at 1369.\n\n- Faculty assignment: Although faculty members were not being\n        assigned with a discriminatory purpose, there was also \"no sus-\n        tained effort to desegregate faculties.\" Id. at 1370. The court\n        ordered CMS to work actively to integrate the faculties, so that \"a\n        child attending any school in the system will face about the same\n        chances of having a black or a white teacher as he would in any\n        other school.\" Id.\n\n- School siting: The court underscored that the desirability of imple-\n        menting a \"neighborhood school\" policy, under which efforts were\n        made to locate schools in neighborhoods and within walking dis-\n        tance for children, could not override the constitutional duty to\n        desegregate. Id. at 1369. At the same time, CMS was not to avoid\n        locating new facilities in black neighborhoods. Id. at 1371.\n\nIn light of Green, Judge McMillan also ordered CMS to submit a\nnew, amended desegregation plan, and he outlined certain possible\nremedies, including busing and re-zoning. Swann, 300 F. Supp. at\n1360; Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp.\n1299, 1302 (W.D.N.C. 1969).\n\nOnce again, however, CMS was slow to respond, prompting Judge\nMcMillan to impose a deadline of August 4, 1969, by which the\nBoard was to submit a detailed desegregation plan to the court. See\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F. Supp. 1381,\n1382, 1386 (W.D.N.C. 1969). CMS complied, and its proposed\ndesegregation plan appeared to accept, for the first time, the constitu-\ntional duty to desegregate students, teachers, principals, and staffs \"`at\nthe earliest possible date.'\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 306 F. Supp. 1291, 1293 (W.D.N.C. 1969). The Board's pro-\nposed desegregation plan, approved by the district court on an interim\nbasis (\"interim desegregation plan\"), included programs for faculty\ndesegregation, the closing of seven all-black schools, and the reas-\nsignment of pupils from the closed schools to outlying, predominantly\nwhite schools. Id. at 1298-99. In approving the plan on an interim\nbasis, the district court noted that black children were bearing a dis-\n\n                  11\n\fproportionate burden of the desegregation efforts, but the court none-\ntheless concluded that some action -- even if interim -- was\npreferable to none at all. Id. at 1298. Judge McMillan also ordered the\nBoard to submit another desegregation plan within three months.\n\nIn November and December 1969, the district court determined\nthat the school system's compliance with the interim desegregation\nplan was unsatisfactory, finding that the Board was continuing to per-\npetuate segregation:\n\n        The School Board is sharply divided in the expressed views\n        of its members. From the testimony of its members, and\n        from the latest report, it cannot be concluded that a majority\n        of its members have accepted the court's orders as repre-\n        senting the law which applies to the local schools. By the\n        responses to the October 10 questions, the Board has indi-\n        cated that its members do not accept the duty to desegregate\n        the schools at any ascertainable time; and they have clearly\n        indicated that they intend not to do it effective in the fall of\n        1970. They have also demonstrated a yawning gap between\n        predictions and performance.\n\nSwann, 306 F. Supp. at 1306. At that time, the district court also\nreviewed and rejected the Board's newly submitted amended desegre-\ngation plan. Id. at 1313-14. Then, the court appointed Dr. John A.\nFinger, Jr. as an expert consultant to prepare a more acceptable plan.\nThis appointment came nearly two years after the Supreme Court's\nGreen decision and more than fifteen years after Brown I.\n\nThe district court ultimately adopted Dr. Finger's proposed plan for\nelementary schools and the Board's plan, as modified by Dr. Finger,\nfor secondary schools (collectively the \"Finger Plan\"). Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265, 268-70\n(W.D.N.C. 1970). In doing so, the court again observed the Board's\nfailure to make an effective beginning to desegregation: \"The School\nBoard, after four opportunities and nearly ten months of time, have\nfailed to submit a lawful plan (one which desegregates all the\nschools). This default on their part leaves the court in the position of\nbeing forced to prepare or choose a lawful plan.\" Id. at 267.\n\n                  12\n\fThe Finger Plan included several components. First, students were\nto be assigned \"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various\nschools at various grade levels have about the same proportion of\nblack and white students.\" Id. at 268. Second, \"no school [could] be\noperated with an all-black or predominantly black student body.\" Id.\nThird, in redrawing the school system's attendance zones, the Board\nwas authorized to use bus transportation and noncontiguous \"satellite\nzones\"33 to accomplish its goals. Id. Fourth, the district court restricted\nthe student transfer policy in order to safeguard against resegregation.\nId. at 268-69. Fifth, the race of faculty members at each school had\nto approximate the ratio of black and white faculty members through-\nout the system. Id. at 268. Sixth, the overall competence of teachers\nat formerly black schools could not be inferior to those at formerly\nwhite schools. Id. Finally, the district court mandated that the Board\nmonitor and report on its progress in implementing the plan. Id. at\n269.\n\nThe Finger Plan was challenged on several occasions and, in 1971,\nthe Supreme Court upheld it as a valid exercise of the district court's\nequitable powers. Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32. Indeed, the Court specif-\nically found that the district court's adoption of a student assignment\nplan that used race-based \"mathematical ratios\" as a starting point was\nwell within the court's \"equitable remedial discretion.\" Id. at 25.\n\nEven after the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, the district\ncourt found that the Board's desegregation efforts failed to meet con-\nstitutional requirements. For example, Judge McMillan ordered stu-\ndent assignment proposals revised in June 1971, finding that the\nproposals \"were discriminatory in detail and in overall result; they\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 CMS used \"satellite zones\" in connection with elementary schools.\nUnder this method, students from a small geographic area located outside\nan elementary school's primary attendance area were assigned to that\nschool. J.A. 15571, 16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9 & n.3. The use\nof satellite zones was implemented by \"pairing\" elementary schools --\nstudents from a predominantly black neighborhood were bused to a\nschool in a predominantly white neighborhood for grades K-3, and stu-\ndents from a predominantly white neighborhood were bused to a school\nin a predominantly black neighborhood for grades 4-6. J.A. 15571,\n16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9-10.\n\n                  13\n\fplaced increasing burdens upon black patrons while partially relieving\nwhite patrons of similar burdens.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nBd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346, 1347 (W.D.N.C. 1971). During the\n1971-72 and 1972-73 school years, the district court attempted a\n\"hands-off\" approach, leaving the Board to remedy problems as they\narose, but the court twice found that the Board still had not adopted\nsufficient measures to guard against resegregation and ensure that\nwhites were bearing an appropriate share of the desegregation burden.\nSee Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp.\n1223, 1230 (W.D.N.C. 1973); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102 (W.D.N.C. 1974); see also discussion of\nspecific findings infra.\n\nThe 1974 order expressed somewhat more optimism about the\nBoard's desegregation efforts. In that order, Judge McMillan\napproved a student assignment proposal that, if implemented prop-\nerly, would result in \"a fair and stable school operation\" and would\npermit the court to close the case as an active matter. See 379 F. Supp.\nat 1103. The proposal made provisions for several \"optional schools\"\n-- schools that would offer some specialized program or curriculum\nand thereby attract students of all races from across Charlotte and\nMecklenburg County. Although Judge McMillan approved the incor-\nporation of these schools into the plan, he cautioned that the optional\nschools would be inconsistent with the school board's constitutional\nobligations if they merely served to re-institute \"freedom of choice.\"\nId. at 1104 (\"`Freedom of choice' was a synonym for segregation for\nmany years, and . . . it should not be resurrected at this late date sub\nnom. `optional schools' without adequate safeguards against discrimi-\nnatory results.\"). To ensure that the optional schools served their\nstated purpose of furthering the process of desegregation, Judge\nMcMillan decreed that \"optional school enrollments will be con-\ntrolled starting with 1974 so that they . . . have about or above 20%\nblack students.\" Id.\n\nFinally, in July 1975, over twenty years after the mandate of Brown\nII, Judge McMillan for the first time observed, albeit with reserva-\ntions, that the Board was actually working toward desegregation:\n\"The new Board has taken a more positive attitude toward desegrega-\ntion and has at last openly supported affirmative action to cope with\nrecurrent racial problems in pupil assignment.\" Swann v. Charlotte-\n\n                  14\n\fMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 67 F.R.D. 648, 649 (W.D.N.C. 1975).\nAlthough the district court cautioned that problems remained, the new\nvigor with which the Board was pursuing desegregation persuaded\nJudge McMillan to close Swann as an active matter of litigation and\nto remove it from the court's docket. Id. at 649-50. In so acting, the\ncourt reaffirmed that its orders still stood: \"[t]his case contains many\norders of continuing effect, and could be re-opened upon proper\nshowing that those orders are not being observed.\" Id. at 649.\n\n4.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1992, two significant actions were taken in con-\nnection with the CMS desegregation litigation.\n\na.\n\nFirst, in 1978, a group of white parents and children brought suit\nagainst CMS, seeking an order prohibiting the Board from assigning\nchildren pursuant to the Board's latest student-assignment plan. See\nMartin, 475 F. Supp. at 1320. The Martin plaintiffs claimed that the\nSupreme Court's then-recent decisions in Pasadena City Bd. of Educ.\nv. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436 (1976), and University of Cal. Regents\nv. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 305 (1978), prohibited any consideration of\nrace in student assignment. 475 F. Supp. at 1321. The Swann plain-\ntiffs intervened in Martin, joining the Board's opposition to the con-\ntentions of the Martin plaintiffs. Id.\n\nA brief review of Spangler and Bakke is necessary to an under-\nstanding of Martin. In Spangler, the Supreme Court held that because\nthe Pasadena Unified School District (\"PUSD\") had achieved racial\nneutrality in its school attendance pattern, \"the District Court was not\nentitled to require the PUSD to rearrange its attendance zones each\nyear so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was main-\ntained in perpetuity.\" 427 U.S. at 436. All parties in Spangler agreed\nthat the plan initially achieved racial neutrality in student attendance;\nnonetheless, the district court had believed it was empowered to annu-\nally readjust school boundaries to ensure in perpetuity that there\nwould be no majority of any minority race at any Pasadena school.\nId. at 433, 436. In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that a public\nuniversity with no history of discrimination could not constitutionally\n\n                  15\n\freserve sixteen out of one hundred admission slots for racial minori-\nties. 438 U.S. at 319-20. In striking down this admissions plan, the\nCourt had made clear that \"[w]hen a classification denies an individ-\nual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of his\nrace or ethnic background, [it must] be regarded as [constitutionally]\nsuspect.\" Id. at 305.\n\nJudge McMillan, who retained jurisdiction over Swann and pre-\nsided over Martin, first held that because CMS had not achieved\nracial neutrality in student attendance, consideration of race in student\nassignment policies was appropriate under Swann . See Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 626 F.2d 1165 (4th Cir. 1980).\nHe explained that because the student assignment policy in the CMS\nschool system had been independently adopted by the Board, it was\nnot established, as the Spangler policy had been, via judicial coercion\nor order. 475 F. Supp. at 1340-43. Second, Judge McMillan ruled that\nBakke was inapposite to the claims of the Martin plaintiffs. Specifi-\ncally, the court reasoned that no child was being denied access to\nequal educational opportunity because of race, see id. at 1321, and the\nactions of the Board were therefore not constitutionally suspect under\nBakke.\n\nIn upholding the independent actions of the Board, Judge McMil-\nlan made several important findings. For example, he found that dis-\ncrimination had not ended; indeed, it was this very finding that led the\ncourt to uphold the 1978 race-conscious student assignment policy.\nId. at 1346-47. Also, although for the first time the district court\npraised the efforts of the Board without reservation, it underscored yet\nagain the need for patience and continued efforts:\n\n       It took three centuries to develop a slave culture, to fight a\n       bloody civil war, and to live through the century of racial\n       turmoil after that war.\n\n***\n\n       The culture and attitudes and results of three centuries of\n       segregation cannot be eliminated nor corrected in ten years.\n       Human nature and practices don't change that fast, even in\n       the hands of people of good will like the members of the\n\n                  16\n\f        present School Board. They need time to work their own\n        experiments, and to find their own ways of producing the\n        sustained operation of a system of schools in which racial\n        discrimination will play no part. I vote to uphold their\n        efforts to date, and to give them that time.\n\nId. at 1347. In 1980, we affirmed the district court's decision in Mar-\ntin. See 626 F.2d at 1165.\n\nb.\n\nThe second significant phase of litigation between 1975 and 1992\nwas initiated in 1980. At that time, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs\nnotified the district court that the black student population in CMS\nelementary schools had grown from twenty-nine percent to forty per-\ncent, making it increasingly difficult to comply with the desegregation\norder's mandate to avoid majority-black elementary schools. In\nresponse to this change, Judge McMillan approved a modification to\nthe desegregation plan. Instead of prohibiting a \"predominantly black\nstudent body,\" the court permitted CMS to operate elementary\nschools with a black student population of \"plus 15 percent\" above\nthe district-wide average. Thus, if the school district averaged forty\npercent black students, any individual school could have fifty-five\npercent black students.\n\n5.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1992, the Board continued to operate its desegrega-\ntion plan as approved by the district court, focusing, inter alia, on sat-\nellite attendance zones, a feeder plan (assigning middle-school\nstudents from a certain neighborhood to identified high schools),\nschool closings, and construction of new schools. Then, in 1992,\nCMS substantially increased its reliance on \"optional\" or magnet\nschools (the \"expanded magnet schools program\"). The Board placed\nnew emphasis on magnet schools in order to phase out\"pairing\" and\nheavy reliance on busing, and to give parents more choice in school\nselection. It was the expanded magnet schools program that ultimately\nled to the present phase of this litigation.\n\n                   17\n\f6.\n\nIn September 1997, William Capacchione, individually and on\nbehalf of his daughter Christina, sued CMS claiming that Christina\nwas unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school. Chris-\ntina is Hispanic and Caucasian, and her suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nsought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. In response,\nCMS moved to dismiss Capacchione's suit and, almost simulta-\nneously, the Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann, claiming\nthat CMS was not yet in compliance with past desegregation orders\nand had not yet achieved unitary status. Because Judge McMillan had\ndied, the cases were assigned to Senior Judge Robert D. Potter, who\nrestored Swann to the district court's docket, consolidated the cases,\ndenied CMS's motion to dismiss, and granted Capacchione's motion\nto intervene.44\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs claimed that CMS had long since elim-\ninated the vestiges of segregation in its schools, and that its formerly\ndual system of white and black schools had, for some time, been uni-\ntary. They also contended that CMS, while still operating under the\ncourt's desegregation orders, had violated those orders and the consti-\ntutional rights of white students in its efforts to desegregate the school\nsystem by employing a race-conscious assignment lottery in its\nexpanded magnet schools program. The Swann plaintiffs countered\nthat the school system had not yet achieved unitary status. CMS\nacknowledged that it was not yet in compliance with past desegrega-\ntion orders and agreed that it should not be declared to have achieved\nunitary status. CMS also contended that, in any event, the expanded\nmagnet schools program constituted an entirely constitutional and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 Since filing suit, the Capacchiones have moved to California. Based\non that fact and other findings, the district court determined that William\nCapacchione no longer possessed standing to seek injunctive or declara-\ntory relief, but that he did have standing to pursue compensatory relief.\nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228, 240\n(W.D.N.C. 1999). Another group of white parents intervened in the con-\nsolidated action and that group, represented by plaintiff Michael Grant,\nclaimed that CMS has achieved unitary status. The various groups of\nplaintiffs that have joined in Capacchione's claims are hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the Capacchione plaintiffs.\"\n\n                  18\n\fappropriate integration tool authorized under the desegregation orders\nin this case. The Swann plaintiffs, while endorsing the concept of\nmagnet schools, argued that the expanded magnet schools program,\nas implemented, was contributing to the resegregation of the school\nsystem.\n\nFollowing a bench trial conducted from April 19 to June 22, 1999,\nthe court, on September 9, 1999, filed its Memorandum of Decision\nand Order, from which this appeal is taken. See Capacchione v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 57 F. Supp. 2d 228 (W.D.N.C. 1999).\nAlthough the Board claimed that unitary status had not been achieved,\nthe district court found that it had. In its ruling, the district court then\nfound that the Board's expanded magnet schools program, even\nthough instituted to effect court-ordered desegregation, was unconsti-\ntutional. Furthermore, the court enjoined the Board from \"assigning\nchildren to schools or allocating educational opportunities and bene-\nfits through race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other\nmeans that deny students an equal footing based on race.\" Id. at 294.\nFinally, the court awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs nominal mone-\ntary damages and substantial attorney's fees.\n\nFollowing the filing of timely notices of appeal, the Swann plain-\ntiffs and CMS sought a stay of Judge Potter's September 9, 1999\ninjunction. On December 30, 1999, we granted the requested stay\npending further order of this court. Thereafter, the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs petitioned for an initial hearing en banc, which was denied by an\neight-to-three vote of the Court. Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 211 F.3d 853 (4th Cir. 2000). The panel heard argument in\nthese appeals on June 7, 2000.\n\nC.\n\nWe are now called upon to review the district court's various deter-\nminations relating to these consolidated appeals. Having reviewed\nand carefully considered each of the important questions determined\nby the district court, we affirm in part; however, we must reverse in\npart, and we must vacate and remand on certain issues.\n\nThe district court's findings suffice to uphold its determination that\nthe Board achieved progress toward desegregation in the 1970s and\n\n                   19\n\f1980s, and the court was therefore justified in concluding that CMS\nhad achieved unitary status in some respects. However, the district\ncourt's findings do not support its conclusion that CMS has attained\nunitary status in every respect. Moreover, even if CMS could now\nproperly be found to have achieved unitary status in toto, it would be\ninappropriate to assess the expanded magnet schools program as if\nthere had been no court order in place. The expanded magnet schools\nprogram and the race-conscious lottery it employed were undertaken\nto remedy the effects of past segregation and were in compliance with\ncourt orders governing this case; they do not violate the Constitution.\nConsequently, the award of nominal damages, substantial attorney's\nfees, and an overbroad injunction barring any future consideration of\nrace in school assignments and other fundamental aspects of school\noperations cannot stand.\n\nII.\n\nWe first address the district court's unitary status decision. The\ndetermination of whether any part of a school system has achieved\nunitary status is a factual one; therefore, we review the district court's\nfindings as to unitary status for clear error. See Riddick v. School Bd.\nof the City of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 533 (4th Cir. 1986); see also\nJacksonville Branch, NAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 883 F.2d\n945, 952 n.3 (11th Cir. 1989) (citing United States v. Texas Educ.\nAgency, 647 F.2d 504, 506 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981)). We do not, how-\never, defer to the district court on conclusions of law, including the\ndistrict court's understanding of controlling law or the various bur-\ndens of proof and presumptions; consequently, we review any such\nconclusions of law de novo. See, e.g., In re Brice, 188 F.3d 576, 577\n(4th Cir. 1999).\n\nA.\n\n1.\n\nIndisputably, the school system of Charlotte-Mecklenburg County\nsubjected African-Americans to nearly a century of segregation and\ndiscrimination. Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized as much in\nSwann, noting that North Carolina was one of the states with \"a long\nhistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system\n\n                  20\n\fdeliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate\npupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\" 402 U.S. at 5-6. In this\ncontext the remedies forcefully endorsed in Brown II, including the\nuse of race conscious measures, are necessary to eradicate the invidi-\nous segregation at which they are aimed.\n\nMoreover, court supervision over local school boards, also\nembraced in Brown and its progeny, is entirely appropriate whenever\n\"school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations\" \"to take what-\never steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination would be eliminated.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15.\nNot only are the federal courts entitled to supervise and direct the\nactions of local school boards under those circumstances, but the\nscope of federal authority is almost plenary: \"Once a right and a vio-\nlation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable pow-\ners to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are\ninherent in equitable remedies.\" Id. There is no doubt that CMS was\njustifiably subjected to federal court supervision; in fact, even after\nthe Board had been subjected to court supervision, it had to be repeat-\nedly ordered to begin the process of desegregation.\n\nUltimately, however, the goal in a desegregation case such as this\nis to reach the point at which federal supervision is no longer war-\nranted and the use of race-conscious measures is no longer necessary.\nSee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. The Supreme Court has identified six\nfactors (collectively the \"original Green factors\") that must be free\nfrom racial discrimination before the mandate of Brown is met: (1)\nstudent assignment, (2) physical facilities, (3) transportation, (4) fac-\nulty, (5) staff, and (6) extracurricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at\n435. Not only are reviewing courts to ascertain whether these original\nGreen factors are free from racial discrimination, but courts also are\nentitled, in their discretion, to identify other factors (\"ancillary factors\")5\n                                                                              5\nand \"determine whether minority students were being disadvantaged\nin ways that required the formulation of new and further remedies to\nensure full compliance with the court's decree.\" 503 U.S. at 492.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 For convenience, we refer to the original Green factors and any ancil-\nlary factors identified by the district court as \"Green factors.\"\n\n                   21\n\f2.\n\nFor school systems proceeding through the difficult process of\ndesegregation, the Supreme Court has adopted the goal of achieving\nunitary status. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486-87; Board of Educ. of Okla.\nCity Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 245-46 (1991). Although\nprior to the Court's Dowell and Freeman decisions federal courts used\nthe term \"unitary status\" somewhat inconsistently, see Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 486-87; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, the term has now come\nto mean that the school system has been unified such that the vestiges\nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 487; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38. When a school sys-\ntem achieves unitary status, federal courts must withdraw supervision\nover the local school board.\n\nIn this case, Judge Potter declared that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus in every respect. The Supreme Court has directed that an appel-\nlate court review a district court's unitary status determination by\napplying a two-part inquiry (the \"Freeman inquiries\"). An appellate\ncourt must determine if (1) a school Board has, in good faith, com-\nplied with the desegregation decree since it was entered; and (2) the\nvestiges of de jure segregation in the school system have been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50).\n\nIf the party seeking a declaration of unitary status cannot demon-\nstrate that the school system has achieved unitary status in its entirety,\nwe then undertake to determine whether the school system has\nachieved unitary status with respect to one or some of the Green fac-\ntors (\"partial unitary status\"). At that point, we apply, with respect to\neach Green factor, the two Freeman inquiries along with one addi-\ntional Freeman-mandated inquiry: \"whether retention of judicial con-\ntrol [over one aspect of the school system] is necessary or practicable\nto achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school\nsystem.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. This third Freeman inquiry rec-\nognizes that the Green factors are -- to a great extent -- interrelated,\nand when determining whether judicial supervision over a school\nboard may be withdrawn, the overlap between the Green factors is a\ncrucial consideration.\n\n                  22\n\fThe Freeman analysis brings us to the most difficult questions\npresented in any desegregation case: whether present racial isolation\nis a vestige of past segregation and, if so, whether a school board can\npracticably reduce that racial isolation. It is even difficult to define\n\"vestige\" in this context. See id. at 502 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"We\nhave never sought to describe how one identifies . . . a `vestige' or\na `remnant' of past . . . .\"). The vestiges \"that are the concern of the\nlaw may be subtle and intangible but nonetheless they must be so real\nthat they have a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied.\"\nId. at 496 (Kennedy, J.); see also id. at 512 (Souter, J., concurring)\n(citing Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 465 & n.13\n(1979), and Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, Denver, 413 U.S. 189, 211\n& n.17 (1973)) (court must order affirmative remedy where school\nboard's conduct \"create[d] or contribute[d] to\" racial identifiability of\nschools). We adhere to the most common-sense meaning of \"vestige\":\nit is a condition or occurrence causally related to the former de jure\nsystem of segregation.\n\nBecause a school system's duty to eliminate such vestiges is\nrestricted by the availability of practicable measures for doing so, see\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492, it is also incumbent on us to consider prac-\nticability. In determining the practicability of further measures, the\ndistrict court must look to numerous indicia of the system's operation.\nPracticability depends on the feasibility of the proposed method, from\nboth a financial and an administrative perspective. Cf. id. at 481-83,\n493-97. Whether a measure is practicable also depends on whether it\nis \"directed to curing the effects of the specific violation,\" and\nwhether it is likely to do so. Id. at 497.\n\nOur duty, in reviewing Judge Potter's decision, see Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 228, is clear. We must examine each Green factor\nand ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved with respect\nto any or all of them. Because the district court declared the entire\nCMS school system to have achieved unitary status, we must assess,\nwith respect to each Green factor, whether the Board has complied,\nin good faith, with the desegregation decree and whether the vestiges\nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50). If the\nschool system has not achieved unitary status in its entirety, then,\n\n                   23\n\fconsistent with Freeman, we also must weigh the degree of interre-\nlatedness existing between the various Green factors.\n\nB.\n\nBy way of introduction to our analysis of this case, we first address\na fundamental flaw in the district court's proceedings -- a flaw aris-\ning from the district court's failure to give any consideration to a\nremedial plan sought to be admitted as evidence by CMS. Following\nthe filing of the Capacchione plaintiffs' Complaint in Intervention,\nthe Board undertook to produce a comprehensive analysis of whether\nvestiges of de jure segregation existed in CMS and whether any such\nvestiges could be practicably remedied. The Board analyzed available\ndata and identified several vestiges remaining; then, in line with the\nmandate of Freeman, the Superintendent of CMS developed a plan\ncontaining practicable remedial steps. The Board independently\nreviewed this plan and, on March 30, 1999, adopted the \"Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Schools' Remedial Plan to Address the Remaining Ves-\ntiges of Segregation\" (the \"Plan\" or \"Remedial Plan\"). J.A. 11029.\n\nConsistent with pretrial deadlines, CMS filed the Remedial Plan\nwith the district court as a potential exhibit at trial. J.A. 11028. At the\npretrial conference conducted on April 13, 1999, the Capacchione\nplaintiffs moved in limine to exclude the Remedial Plan. In essence,\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs maintained that the trial had been bifur-\ncated into two phases and that only unitary status was at issue in the\nfirst phase. They further maintained that the Remedial Plan contained\nproposed remedies that could only be implemented if CMS was deter-\nmined not to have achieved unitary status. Because the unitary status\nquestion had not yet been resolved, they claimed that the Remedial\nPlan (which the Capacchione plaintiffs characterized as a damages\nreport) was irrelevant.\n\nIn opposing exclusion of the Remedial Plan, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs relied on the Supreme Court's Freeman analysis. J.A. 1421.\nSpecifically, they asserted that each unitary status determination\nencompassed in the first phase of the trial turned on \"whether the ves-\ntiges have been remedied to the extent practicable.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded). The Remedial Plan, they claimed, was not merely relevant,\n\n                   24\n\fbut crucial, to establishing both the existence of vestiges of segrega-\ntion and the practicability of remedial measures.\n\nJudge Potter responded with two rulings. First, Judge Potter\nexplained in assessing whether CMS had achieved unitary status that\nhe believed Freeman required him to consider just one thing: \"only\n. . . what CMS has done, not what it may do in the future.\" See Order\nof April 14, 1999 at 4. Second, based on this understanding of Free-\nman and the unitary status test, Judge Potter concluded that the Reme-\ndial Plan was irrelevant: \"If the Court later determines that additional\nremedial measures are needed, it may consider the plan. Until that\ntime comes, however, the Court will not get mired in the complex\ndetails and mechanics of a proposed plan.\" Id. at 5.6\n                                                    6\n\nWe believe Judge Potter erred in both of these rulings. First, he\nmisapprehended Freeman and its test for unitary status. At the outset,\nFreeman explicitly rejects, as a matter of law, the very analysis\nadopted by the district court. That is, under Freeman, a district court\nmust consider (1) compliance with prior orders (i.e., \"what CMS has\ndone\"), and (2) whether vestiges have been eliminated to the extent\npracticable (i.e., \"what [CMS] may do in the future\"). See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 491; see also Order of April 14, 1999 at 4. By construing\nFreeman's unitary status test to include the former (\"what CMS has\ndone\") but not the latter (\"what [CMS] may do in the future\"), Judge\nPotter erred as a matter of law.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Judge Potter also chided CMS for proffering the Remedial Plan \"after\nthe deadline for fact discovery and expert witness discovery had\nexpired.\" On the contrary, CMS fulfilled all of its duties under the fed-\neral rules, appropriately supplementing its responses to discovery\nrequests as soon as the Remedial Plan had been adopted. Furthermore,\na more precipitant proposal could not have incorporated the various\nexpert perspectives developed during discovery. A similar plan submit-\nted earlier in the course of the litigation necessarily would have been\nbased largely on speculation and supposition, and therefore would have\nbeen far less useful and pertinent. As it was, the Plan was tendered in\nadvance of the non-jury trial, and, of great significance, almost five\nmonths before the district court issued its decision. Neither the court nor\nthe parties could have been inconvenienced by the necessary timing of\nthe Remedial Plan's submission.\n\n                  25\n\fThe Remedial Plan directly addresses the latter inquiry, and it does\nso in an apt, informed manner, relying on the considered opinions of\nhighly capable professionals retained to analyze the latest available\ndata. In other words, the district court's second reason for excluding\nthe Plan -- relevancy -- also fails to withstand scrutiny.77 There is no\ndoubt that Judge Potter had wide discretion on this issue, but rele-\nvancy is a fluid concept under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See\nFed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any ten-\ndency to make the existence\" of any material fact\"more probable or\nless probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently,\nrelevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. See,\ne.g., United States v. Van Metre, 150 F.3d 339, 349 (4th Cir. 1998)\n(citing United States v. Powers, 59 F.3d 1460, 1465 (4th Cir. 1995)).\n\nHowever, we need not rely on the minimal threshold encompassed\nin the test for relevancy because this Remedial Plan would be relevant\nunder any reasonable test. The Remedial Plan identified record evi-\ndence (including the deposition testimony of several experts) support-\ning the Board's belief that vestiges of de jure segregation in CMS\nremain apparent in (1) faculty assignment and quality, (2) physical\nfacilities and the allocation of instructional resources, (3) student\nachievement, and (4) student assignment. More importantly, the\nRemedial Plan detailed specific steps that the Board proposed to\nundertake over the course of the ensuing five years \"with a goal of\nachieving unitary status at that time.\" J.A. 11029.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 Taking the district court at its word that the only question before it\ninitially was the extent of the Board's compliance with the prior desegre-\ngation orders, the Remedial Plan was nonetheless highly relevant for\neven that purpose. The ease with which some of the proposed Plan reme-\ndies could be realized, e.g., merely distributing available funding to\naddress the stark disparity in basic resources such as instructional materi-\nals and media centers, see J.A. 11040, strongly suggests that the Board\nhad not fully implemented the long-standing dictates of the prior orders.\nThe court nonetheless observed that \"while the goal of perfect compli-\nance with court orders has remained elusive, no evidence has been\npresented that school authorities were guilty of easily correctable errors.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 283. To the contrary, the Plan thoroughly\ndocumented the Board's failings and the facility with which they could\nbe rectified. The district court simply chose to ignore this highly relevant\nevidence.\n\n                  26\n\fWithout a doubt, federal courts possess the final word in deciding\nwhether a particular school system is operating within the parameters\nof the Constitution. Appreciable weight must be given, however, to\nthe views of those selected by the community to administer the sys-\ntem. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248 (noting specialized knowledge pos-\nsessed by local school officials).8\n                                  8 In refusing to consider the Plan, the\ndistrict court erroneously failed to accord the Board's official position\nany weight, much less the respect that it was due.\n\nThat the district court so completely disregarded this crucial evi-\ndence is telling. Nonetheless, we have carefully examined each con-\nclusion below, ever mindful of the deference accorded the factfinder.\nThe manifest importance of this case (quite apart from the substantial\ntime and energy invested by the parties and the court below) demands\nthat we carefully explain the myriad aspects of our decision today.\nWe now embark upon that task.\n\n1. Student Assignment\n\nOf all the Green factors, the most fundamental is the degree of\nracial imbalance in student assignment. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474.\nUniformity in the racial composition of a given school was the hall-\nmark of official discrimination, \"for under the former de jure regimes\nracial exclusion was both the means and the end of a policy motivated\nby disparagement of, or hostility towards, the disfavored race.\" Id.\nCourt-ordered desegregation was designed to meet the enemy head-\non; the long-term stability of attempts at racial balancing in student\nassignment is often seen as the most conspicuous indication of the\ncourts' success (or lack thereof) in combating the underlying societal\nevil.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8 Though we need not grant CMS the same deference afforded the pro-\nmulgations and adjudications of a federal administrative agency, the for-\nmal declarations of its governing Board \"do constitute a body of\nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may\nproperly resort for guidance.\" Ritter v. Cecil County Office of Housing\n& Community Dev., 33 F.3d 323, 328 (4th Cir. 1994) (quoting Skidmore\nv. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)).\n\n                  27\n\fWe must now determine whether present racial isolation in CMS\nmay be a vestige of the former dual system, and, if so, whether there\nare practicable measures CMS could take to reduce or eliminate that\nisolation. In doing so, we are bound to focus particularly on the\nBoard's record of compliance with the district court's desegregation\norders. See id. at 492 (citing Dowell). Because significant and grow-\ning racial imbalances in student assignment do exist in CMS, because\nthe Board for decades has failed to comply with certain specific\ndecrees of the district court (particularly regarding the siting of new\nschools), because these failures may have contributed to current racial\nisolation, and because future compliance might practicably reduce\nthis racial isolation, we must vacate the district court's finding that\nCMS has achieved unitary status with respect to student assignment.\n\na.\n\nIn the wake of the 1970 desegregation order, virtually all of the\nschools in CMS operated in racial balance for a considerable time. By\n1998-99 however, nearly thirty percent of the schools in the system\nhad become racially identifiable.9\n                                 9 Of the 126 schools included in the\nCMS desegregation plan, twenty-three are identifiably black and thir-\nteen more are identifiably white. J.A. 11587. Further, virtually all of\nthe identifiably black schools are located in either the inner city or in\nthe immediate northwest-to-northeast suburbs, the areas of Mecklen-\nburg County with the highest concentration of African-Americans. In\nstark contrast, all thirteen of the identifiably white schools are found\nin the extreme northern and southern areas of the county, both of\nwhich (and particularly the latter) have seen dramatic increases in\nwhite population during the past thirty years. The trend in CMS\ntoward resegregation of its schools has accelerated markedly since the\nmove to de-emphasize satellite zones and mandatory busing in 1992.\nIn the last seven years, the number of CMS African-American stu-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 Judge McMillan's final desegregation order mandated, inter alia, that\nno school should become \"racially identifiable.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at\n268. Judge Potter interpreted the phrase synonymously with \"racially\nimbalanced,\" which, as noted within, describes a school with an African-\nAmerican student population deviating more than fifteen points in either\ndirection from the county-wide norm. See Cappachione, 57 F. Supp. 2d\nat 246.\n\n                  28\n\fdents who attend racially identifiable schools (now almost three in\nten) has risen fifty percent. J.A. 9589.\n\nIndisputably, from 1981 until 1997, the CMS school system went\nthrough significant demographic changes. For example, the total pop-\nulation of Mecklenburg County has grown from 354,656 in 1970 to\n613,310 in 1997. J.A. 16247. Almost 100,000 children attend CMS,\nmaking it the twenty-third largest school system in the country. J.A.\n7107. During the period from 1970 to 1997, the black school-age pop-\nulation (ages 5 through 17) in the county has increased by approxi-\nmately 10,000. J.A. 16247. Over the same period, the corresponding\nwhite school-age population has decreased by approximately 3,000,\nid., and by 1997, African-Americans comprised 34 percent of the\ncounty's school-age population, the total of which numbered approxi-\nmately 108,600. Evidence before the district court revealed that, since\n1970, the growing African-American population has migrated out-\nward from the inner city into formerly white suburbs. In turn, many\nwhite citizens who formerly populated the city's periphery have\nmoved even farther into the county's outlying reaches. Though parts\nof the county have become more integrated as the result of these\nshifts, a disproportionately large number of African-Americans still\nreside in contiguous clusters generally north and west of the down-\ntown area.\n\nThe primary issue we must address is whether the thirty-six racially\nidentifiable schools in CMS represent a vestige of segregation -- that\nis, whether the present racial isolation is causally related to the prior\nsystem of de jure segregation. The Swann plaintiffs argue, and CMS\nagrees, that current racial isolation, like the racial isolation of the\n1960s and 1970s, results both from past inequities that, to some\nextent, have persisted to this day, and from the Board's failure to\ncomply with certain specific directives in the remedial decrees in this\ncase.\n\nBecause CMS has not previously been adjudged to have achieved\nunitary status in student assignment, we are bound under Swann to\npresume that the current racial imbalance in the school population\nconstitutes a continuing vestige of segregation. 402 U.S. at 26. The\nCapacchione plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the present\nexistence of predominantly one-race schools in CMS \"is not the result\n\n                  29\n\fof present or past discriminatory action.\" Id.; see also Riddick, 784\nF.2d at 535.\n\nOur unwillingness to affirm the conclusion that CMS is unitary\nwith respect to student assignment centers on the Board's failure to\ncomply with court orders regarding selection of sites for the construc-\ntion of new schools. The role of school siting in achieving sustainable\ndesegregation should not be underestimated. In fact, the importance\nof site selection has been apparent since the early stages of this case.\nAs the Supreme Court explained in 1971:\n\n        In the past [site selection] choices . . . have been used as a\n        potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated\n        school system. . . . [S]chool authorities have sometimes,\n        since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to\n        become racially mixed through changes in neighborhood\n        residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by\n        building new schools in the areas of white suburban expan-\n        sion farthest from Negro population centers in order to\n        maintain the separation of the races with a minimum depar-\n        ture from the formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\"\n        Such a policy does more than simply influence the short-run\n        composition of the student body of a new school. It may\n        well promote segregated residential patterns which, when\n        combined with \"neighborhood zoning,\" further lock the\n        school system into the mold of separation of the races. . . .\n        In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school seg-\n        regation, the existence of a pattern of school construction\n        and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight.\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 21.\n\nSubsequent to the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, Judge\nMcMillan specifically ordered that site selection for new schools\ncould not \"be predicated on population trends alone.\" 379 F. Supp. at\n1107. New schools were \"to be built where they can readily serve\nboth races.\" Id. In the 1979 Martin decision,10\n                                             10 Judge McMillan\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 Judge Potter incorrectly declared that \"Martin was not a unitary sta-\ntus hearing[.]\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250. In fact, as the accom-\n\n                   30\n\fdevoted an entire section of his opinion to demonstrating that \"con-\nstruction, location and closing of school buildings continue to pro-\nmote segregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1329. Judge McMillan explained\nthat \"[t]he location of schools plays a large if not determinative role\nin . . . insuring that any given assignment and feeder plan will provide\nmeaningful desegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived\nappearance of desegregation.\" Id. at 1332.\n\nIn the years since this decree was issued, CMS has built twenty-\nfive of twenty-seven new schools in predominantly white suburban\ncommunities. In the mid-1980s, CMS adopted a formal policy of\nbuilding \"midpoint\" schools -- schools located midway between\nblack and white population centers. There is little evidence, however,\nto suggest that CMS faithfully adhered to this policy. Rather, record\nevidence strongly indicates that the policy influenced the site selec-\ntion for, at most, four of the twenty-seven new schools. See J.A.\n15404-06. Meanwhile, as we discuss infra, there is substantial evi-\ndence that CMS has allowed many of its older school facilities in the\ncity -- schools attended in disproportionate numbers by African-\nAmerican students -- to fall into a state of disrepair.\n\nThe Board's record of building the great majority of its new\nschools on the predominantly white suburban fringe of the county\nsupports two possible conclusions. On one hand, CMS could have\nbeen responding to demographic reality -- a demand for new class-\nrooms in areas of high population growth (although we note that the\nnumber of white students in CMS has decreased since 1970, while the\nblack student population has greatly increased). On the other hand,\nthe Board's pattern of school construction could have facilitated or\neven hastened white flight to the suburbs. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Swann, \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just\nas schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location\nof schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npanying text indicates, the white parents in Martin contended, as the\nCapacchione plaintiffs do today, that CMS had achieved unitary status.\nIntervening African-American parents, like those herein, maintained to\nthe contrary. In actuality, there is little difference between today's case\nand Martin, and Judge McMillan's findings in the latter are as binding\non the parties as any others made in the course of this litigation.\n\n                  31\n\fof a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of\ninner-city neighborhoods.\" 402 U.S. at 20-21. The Board's school sit-\ning policies could well evidence its lack of political will in the face\nof pressure to abandon desegregative policies -- pressure from fami-\nlies who \"are concerned about the racial composition of a prospective\nschool and [who] will make residential decisions accordingly.\" Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 513 (Blackmun, J., concurring).\n\nThere is certainly no evidence that CMS has intentionally sought,\nthrough its school siting policies, to \"lock the school system into the\nmold of separation of the races\" in the way that the Supreme Court\ndescribed in Swann. But the actual choices the Board has made with\nregard to school siting may in fact be quite similar to the \"pattern of\nschool construction and abandonment\" described by the Court, with\nthe actual effect that the Court feared of \"lock[ing] the school system\"\ninto a condition of racial isolation. 402 U.S. at 21. We cannot con-\nclude, at least in the absence of further fact-finding, that CMS, in\nchoosing sites for new schools, has pursued \"meaningful desegrega-\ntion, rather than just the predictably short lived appearance of deseg-\nregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1332.\n\nRather, the Board's practice of siting new schools such that they\ncould not reasonably be expected to serve a racially balanced student\npopulation and Judge McMillan's determination that this practice, in\nthe past, represented the school system's failure to eliminate the ves-\ntiges of segregation, together raise a strong inference that those ves-\ntiges remain today. When this inference is viewed in combination\nwith the burden borne by the Capacchione plaintiffs to show that cur-\nrent racial imbalances have no causal link to past discrimination, we\nare compelled to conclude that a remand to the district court is\nrequired.\n\nAlthough we defer to a district court's findings of fact unless\nclearly erroneous, Judge Potter's error here came in his application of\nthe legal standard to the evidence regarding the Board's school siting\npolicies. Judge Potter found that (1) CMS had not discriminated on\nthe basis of race in choosing sites for new schools and that (2) CMS\nhad incorporated racial diversity as one of its factors in site selection.\nEven assuming arguendo that both findings are not clearly erroneous,\nneither is sufficient to support the legal conclusion that in siting new\n\n                   32\n\fschools CMS acted in compliance with the governing court orders and\nConstitution to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent\npracticable.\n\n\"To fulfill this duty, school officials are obligated not only to avoid\nany official action that has the effect of perpetuating or reestablishing\na dual school system, but also to render decisions that further desegre-\ngation and help to eliminate the effects of the previous dual school\nsystem.\" Harris v. Crenshaw County Bd. of Educ., 968 F.2d 1090,\n1095 (11th Cir. 1992) (citing Pitts v. Freeman , 755 F.2d 1423, 1427\n(11th Cir. 1985)). Therefore, CMS had to do more than merely select\nsites for new schools on a nondiscriminatory basis. It had to do more,\ntoo, than simply give some consideration to \"diversity\" in its selection\nof sites. To the extent practicable, CMS had to site new schools\n\"where they can readily serve both races.\" 379 F. Supp. at 1107; see\nalso Swann, 402 U.S. at 21; Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1329-32. Judge\nPotter never found that CMS had met this standard, and as outlined\nwithin, there is substantial record evidence that CMS did not do so.\n\nIn accordance with Swann, the burden is on the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs to prove that vestiges of past discrimination do not remain, or\nthat nothing can practicably be done to remedy them. We note that\nJudge McMillan, in his last published decision in this case, clearly\nevidenced his understanding both that CMS had not done all that it\ncould do in the area of school siting and that future school siting deci-\nsions could practicably advance the process of desegregation. On\nremand, it is thus incumbent on the Capacchione plaintiffs to demon-\nstrate that conditions in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County have\nchanged sufficiently such that school siting no longer represents a\npracticable opportunity to eliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs have identified additional areas in which\nCMS has fallen short of its obligations under the court orders. For the\nlife of the desegregation orders, CMS has consistently placed the\nheaviest burden of mandatory busing on African-American students.\nCurrently, 80% of those students who ride the bus as a result of a\nmandatory assignment are African-American. J.A. 11515. Judge\nMcMillan repeatedly ordered CMS to distribute this burden more\nfairly. See 475 F. Supp. at 1339-40; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362 F.\nSupp. at 1232-33. Yet, CMS has utterly failed to do so. In addition,\n\n                  33\n\fCMS has never developed an effective system for monitoring student\ntransfers to ensure that the overall effect of such transfers is not to\nincrease the racial imbalance in the system as a whole. Again, this\nrepresents a failure to comply with the explicit instructions of the dis-\ntrict court. See 475 F. Supp. at 1337-38; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362\nF. Supp. at 1229-30. We are troubled by these failings on the part of\nCMS. They provide additional support for a conclusion that, in the\nface of political pressure, CMS has not done all that it could do to\neliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\nFinally, the Board has itself taken the remarkable step of admitting\nits noncompliance with prior orders in this case. A school board's\nfrank acquiescence in a position inuring to its detriment (in this case,\nthe potential of ongoing judicial intervention), if not treated as con-\nclusive, should at least be considered with the utmost gravity. Under\nthese circumstances, we have no difficulty in determining that the dis-\ntrict court's conclusion that the Board's level of compliance was \"full\nand satisfactory\" must be vacated.\n\nb.\n\nIf the vestiges of official discrimination have indeed been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable with respect to student assignment,\nthen there is little reason to prolong court supervision. In light of the\ndistrict court's failure, however, to recognize the Board's continuing\nnoncompliance with respect to student assignment -- administered as\nrecently as twenty years ago in a manner reinforcing the once-official\nnotion that African-Americans are inferior -- we have no confidence\nin the court's ultimate finding that these vestiges have now disap-\npeared. We are therefore obliged to vacate the portion of the judgment\nbelow relating to student assignment and remand for further proceed-\nings.\n\nOn remand, the district court must first determine whether, since\nJudge McMillan's decision in Martin, CMS has fulfilled its constitu-\ntional and court-imposed obligations with regard to site selection for\nnew schools. If CMS has failed to fulfill its obligations, the district\ncourt must then determine whether this failure contributed to the pres-\nent condition of racial isolation in the school system. Finally, if CMS\ndid fail to live up to its constitutional and judicially decreed obliga-\n\n                  34\n\ftions, and if that failure did contribute to the present racial imbal-\nances, then the court must determine if proper site selection is a\npracticable remedy for the lingering effects of the Board's past dis-\ncriminatory practices. If not, then the district court should relinquish\ncontrol over student assignment: there is nothing further that CMS\ncan practicably do to eliminate the vestiges of the prior de jure sys-\ntem.\n\nIf, however, proper sites can be found, then the district court should\nretain control over student assignment. The court might decide, for\nexample, that most or all new schools constructed over the next sev-\neral years be located proximate to the inner city or in midpoint areas\nalready integrated residentially. Conversely, the district court may\nconclude that more flexibility is required because of real estate costs,\ncrushing demand in the suburban fringes, or for some other sufficient\nreason. The court should also consider the efficacy of the Board's\nRemedial Plan as a limited term remedy for the racial isolation that\nwould otherwise continue to exist until the Board's newly redirected\nschool siting policies can begin to take effect.11\n                                                11\n\nOf course, some reasons will not be sufficient to deny African-\nAmerican students a remedy, should corrective action be deemed jus-\ntified. For example, political pressure and perceived resistance to\nchange by certain groups in the community will not suffice. Addition-\nally, logistical barriers merely making \"difficult\" the transport inward\nof outlying white students will likewise, if reasonably surmountable,\nnot be enough. Cf. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253 (district\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11 The strategies described in the Remedial Plan may be of particular\nhelp to the court in deciding whether practicable measures are available.\nThe Plan proposes, among other things, to divide Mecklenburg County\ninto three to five demographically similar \"clusters,\" within which stu-\ndents may choose to attend any school, magnet or otherwise. Where the\ndemand for a given school exceeds the available room, spots would be\nassigned by lottery based on factors such as proximity, sibling atten-\ndance, and racial, ethnic, and economic diversity. The Plan also outlines\na formal mechanism to disseminate information regarding the enrollment\nprocess, and it provides that the Board will work with the business com-\nmunity and local government to secure subsidies for disadvantaged fami-\nlies wishing to relocate to areas in which low-cost housing is scarce. See\nJ.A. 11053-59.\n\n                  35\n\fcourt's observation that \"transport[ing] white students in from satel-\nlite zones . . . is difficult given the rush hour traffic patterns\").\nAlthough what is \"practicable\" need not extend to all that is \"possi-\nble,\" rectifying the grievous constitutional wrongs of the past surely\njustifies reaching beyond the \"difficult\" or purely \"problematic.\"\n\n2. Physical Facilities\n\nAfter describing how CMS has allocated its physical facilities and\nresources among its students, Judge Potter concluded that \"the Swann\nplaintiffs have failed to overcome the Court's previous findings on\nfacilities by establishing the requisite discriminatory intent and causa-\ntion.\" Id. at 267. Judge Potter's mention of \"previous findings\" refers\nto excerpts from various opinions and orders authored by Judge\nMcMillan:\n\n        April 1969 -- \"No racial discrimination or inequality is\n        found in the . . . . quality of the school buildings and equip-\n        ment. . . . Schools described by witnesses as `white' ranged\n        well up and down on both sides of [the average per-pupil\n        expenditure], and schools described by witnesses as `black'\n        showed a similar variation.\" 300 F. Supp. at 1366.\n\n        August 1969 -- \"The defendants contended and the court\n        found in its April 23, 1969 order that facilities and teachers\n        in the various black schools were not measurably inferior to\n        those in the various white schools. It is too late now to\n        expect the court to proceed upon an opposite assumption.\"\n        306 F. Supp. at 1298.\n\n        October 1971 -- \"[T]he formerly black schools are not\n        shown nor suggested to be inferior in faculty, plant, equip-\n        ment or program.\" 334 F. Supp. at 625.\n\nToward the close of the prior proceedings in 1975 (and consistent\nwith the above), Judge McMillan awarded attorney's fees to the\nSwann plaintiffs as prevailing parties, \"[e]xcept for the refusal of the\ncourt to find in the plaintiffs' favor . . . regarding adequacy of physi-\ncal plants and equipment and teacher quality.\" Swann, 66 F.R.D. at\n484.\n\n                   36\n\fJudge Potter acknowledged that no court \"ha[d] [ ]ever granted uni-\ntary status to CMS, nor . . . partially withdrawn supervision as to\nfacilities or any other Green factor.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at\n262. The court nevertheless relied on the above 1969 and 1971 find-\nings to release the Capacchione plaintiffs from their burden of prov-\ning CMS unitary with respect to facilities, stating that to proceed\notherwise would \"defy logic.\" Id. at 263. Judge Potter thus accepted\nthe premise that Judge McMillan's 1969 and 1971 findings \"consti-\ntute collateral estoppel and law of the case\" regarding facilities,\n\"thereby shifting the burden to CMS and the Swann plaintiffs to show\ndiscriminatory intent.\" Id. at 262.\n\nWe hold the district court's burden-shifting analysis to constitute\nan error of law. Once the existence of an unlawful dual school system\nhas been established and court supervision begun, it is presumed that\nracial disparities arising during the period of intervention \"are caus-\nally related to prior segregation.\" School Bd. of the City of Richmond\nv. Baliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). Following the imposi-\ntion of judicial control, a party seeking to end the status quo bears the\nburden of overcoming the presumption of causation. If this burden is\nmet and the school system is declared to have achieved unitary status\nas to the particular factor at issue, the presumption ends. Id. Gener-\nally, in any subsequent proceeding involving new allegations of dis-\nparate treatment, the complaining party must show purposeful\ndiscrimination. Riddick, 784 F.2d at 537 (concluding that Swann and\nits progeny require proof of \"discriminatory intent on the part of the\nschool board of a unitary school system\" in order to resume court super-\nvision).12\n        12\n\nTo be sure, the absence heretofore of any finding to the contrary\nwould have been an important consideration in determining whether\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs had proved CMS to have achieved unitary\nstatus with respect to facilities. However, that Judge McMillan did not\nintend his initial observations regarding facilities to be construed as\na finding of unitary status is obvious from his subsequent actions. In\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12 However, if a district court retains jurisdiction over one or more\nGreen factors, it may, upon a proper showing, reassert control over a fac-\ntor previously adjudged to have attained unitary status. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 508-09 (Souter, J., concurring).\n\n                  37\n\f1973, Judge McMillan assumed control over facilities and resources,\nfound inequities, and ordered CMS to remedy those disparities. See\nSwann, 362 F. Supp. at 1235 (finding Double Oaks Elementary access\nroad still undeveloped two years after court's identification of the\nproblem -- \"No $80,000,000 budget is so powerless.\"); id. (finding\nDouble Oaks library not restored to standards several years after fire);\nid. at 1238 (ordering athletic facilities at West Charlotte High School\nimmediately upgraded to level comparable with other schools in the\ncounty). We must conclude that the Board has been subject to the\ncourt's jurisdiction as to its facilities since at least 1973. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 246 (school boards entitled to a \"rather precise statement\"\nterminating a desegregation order).\n\nThe asserted lack of a prior adverse finding should not have been\ndeterminative of the issue, especially as the district court in 1969 was\nnot focusing on a school system suddenly thrust into the judicial\narena, but was instead examining one that had been subject to court\nsupervision for nearly four years. Between the commencement of the\ninitial Swann lawsuit in 1965 and the district court's first mention of\nthe facilities issue in April 1969, CMS closed sixteen black schools.\nThe Board's en masse action gives rise to an almost undeniable infer-\nence that these schools were shut down because they were inferior,\nand the timing also suggests strongly that the closures were prompted\nby the judicial proceedings then underway.\n\nViewed in context, the most plausible conclusion is that the puta-\ntive equality mentioned by the district court in 1969 and 1971 was\nactually an endorsement of the steps that had been taken by the Board\nto remedy the inequities in facilities. In any event, CMS could not be\nsaid to have achieved unitary status absent a finding by the lower\ncourt that the Board had \"eliminated the vestiges of its prior discrimi-\nnation,\" embodied in an \"adjudicat[ion] . . . through the proper judi-\ncial procedures.\" Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v.\nGeorgia, 775 F.2d 1403, 1413 n.12 (11th Cir. 1985), quoted in\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (noting distinction between school systems\noperating in an unitary fashion and those that have achieved unitary\nstatus, and observing that the former \"could be called unitary and nev-\nertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination\").\n\n                  38\n\fThirty-five years have passed since the Board first acted to equalize\nits facilities, yet serious questions remain as to whether it has finally\nrealized that goal. Dr. Dwayne E. Gardner, an impressively qualified\neducational planner and consultant, compiled an exhaustive report for\nthe Board in which he evaluated the suitability of its school facilities.13\n                                                                          13\nDr. Gardner examined and personally visited more than half of the\nschools in CMS (including all of the high schools), analyzing a host\nof factors affecting educational quality. For the purposes of his study,\nDr. Gardner divided the subject schools into three groups: (1) all\nimbalanced-black schools; (2) all racially balanced schools in\nimbalanced-black census tracts; and (3) each remaining high school,\nalong with a set of elementary and middle schools randomly selected\nfrom the remaining schools and approximately equal in number to\nthose already included within the first two groups.\n\nEach school in the study was assigned a composite score from 0-\n100, indicating its worthiness. Schools scoring 44 or lower were, in\nDr. Gardner's opinion, so deficient as to merit replacement, while\nthose with scores between 45-59 were classified as needing \"major\nimprovements.\" Any school that scored 60 or above was \"considered\nto have the ability to serve the educational program adequately.\" J.A.\n12174.\n\nThe results of Dr. Gardner's study are troubling. The average score\nfor the forty Group 3 schools (racially balanced or imbalanced-white\nin predominantly white or balanced areas) was 61.7. Although the\nGroup 3 data indicate a situation that is far from ideal, the ten Group\n2 schools (racially balanced in predominantly black areas) fared much\nworse, with an average score of 56.3. The scores of the twenty-three\nGroup 1 schools (imbalanced-black) were worse still, averaging just\n53.3.14\n     14 At trial, Dr. Gardner confirmed that the disparities apparent\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 The district court found that the expert called on behalf of the Capac-\nchione plaintiffs, Dr. David J. Armor, could offer no reliable testimony\non the subject. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 264.\n\n14 It has been famously said (by either Mark Twain or, earlier, Benja-\nmin Disraeli, depending on one's source), \"There are three kinds of lies\n-- lies, damned lies and statistics.\" A common difficulty in dealing with\nstatistics is illustrated by the district court's analysis of Dr. Gardner's\n\n                   39\n\ffrom the above numbers were \"substantial\" with respect to the facili-\nties generally available to white and African-American children\nattending CMS. J.A. 6196-99.\n\nThe anecdotal accounts of a number of witnesses effectively cor-\nroborated Dr. Gardner's conclusions. See, e.g., J.A. 4992 (testimony\nof Board member Pamela R. Mange) (schools with \"more severe\"\nproblems tended to be predominantly black); J.A. 4769 (testimony of\nAnnelle Houk) (\"[T]he schools that were in the worst repair and had\nthe poorest supply of resources . . . were on the west side and they\nwere predominantly populated by black students.\"). John A. Kramer,\nco-chair of an advisory task force created by the Board, made formal\nvisits to several CMS schools in 1997. Among the locales on Mr.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nstudy. The court first noted that, of the four schools scoring in the lowest\ncategory, two were in Group 1 and two were in Group 3. Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 264-65. Next, the court observed that the two highest\nratings accorded elementary schools were again split between Groups 1\nand 3. Id. at 265. Based on this selective culling of the data, the lower\ncourt concluded that \"the results of Dr. Gardner's analysis do not show\ndisparities along racial lines.\" Id. at 264.\n\nThe forest that is CMS is not sufficiently mapped by the documenta-\ntion of a few trees. We could accurately say, for example, that omission\nfrom Group 1 of the brand-new elementary school referred to by the dis-\ntrict court as having one of the highest ratings would lower the Group 1\naverage by more than a full point. Or we could state without error that\nseven of the twenty-three Group 1 schools (more than 30 percent) scored\nbelow 50, while only five of the forty Group 3 schools (12.5 percent)\nscored similarly. Indeed, we note that none of the Group 1 high schools\nscored higher than 46, yet all those in Groups 2 and 3 scored at 50 or\nabove. Of course, one would rightly view this latter declaration with\nsome skepticism once it became known that there are but fourteen high\nschools in CMS, only two of which were included by Dr. Gardner in\nGroup 1.\n\nThe pick-and-choose method gets us nowhere. The value of Dr. Gard-\nner's research lies in the general conclusions that can be drawn from the\nentirety of the data. The most obvious conclusion is that, as a general\nmatter, imbalanced-black schools in CMS are in worse shape than those\nattended by larger proportions of white students. Once we accept that\npremise, the lone remaining question of any significance is \"Why?\"\n\n                  40\n\fKramer's itinerary were Elizabeth Lane Elementary, a predominantly\nwhite school located in a prosperous suburban area of the county, and\nShamrock Gardens Elementary, a downtown school with an African-\nAmerican student population exceeding sixty percent. Mr. Kramer's\ndescriptions of his visits contrasted sharply:\n\n        [T]o compare Elizabeth Lane Elementary as an example,\n        which is a relatively new school located in Matthews, I\n        walked into that school, I was overwhelmed because I had\n        never set foot in a school that was like that before. It was\n        clean, it was light and airy, it was a beautiful facility. . . .\n        My overwhelming feeling was, wow, I wish my kids could\n        go to this school. And another observation that was very\n        clear was that when I looked at the student body, it was vir-\n        tually all white students, obviously, affluent, happy kids\n        having a great time.\n\n        On the other hand, my experience, for example, at Sham-\n        rock Gardens was shocking by comparison. I had never vis-\n        ited either one of these schools before, but to visit that\n        school which is in the inner city, the students are predomi-\n        nantly black students, it reminded me of a rundown 1950s\n        motel. There was literally no access to the rooms except by\n        outer walkways that were covered by rusted, dilapidated\n        overhead fixtures. . . . They were using closets and things\n        to teach children in. The carpets were stained and thread-\n        bare. . . . It just didn't feel clean, it didn't feel good. And\n        I can honestly say that as a parent, my heartfelt reaction was\n        relief that my children didn't have to go to school there.\n\nJ.A. 6098-99. Even those Board members who voted to pursue a\ndetermination of unitary status before the district court admitted that\ndisparity in facilities was a problem within CMS. J.A. 1817, 1820\n(testimony of James H. Puckett); J.A. 1918-19 (testimony of John W.\nLassiter); J.A. 2095-96 (testimony of Lindalyn Kakadelis).\n\nAlthough it seems reasonably clear that a racial disparity in facili-\nties exists in CMS, its cause is somewhat less apparent. The Capacch-\nione plaintiffs maintain that no discrepancies exist in CMS facilities,\nand even if they do, such discrepancies are totally benign in origin.\n\n                   41\n\fHad the Capacchione plaintiffs proved their theory, we would be con-\nstrained to affirm the district court's conclusion that unitary status has\nbeen achieved with respect to the facilities factor. The district court,\nhowever, required the Capacchione plaintiffs to prove nothing; it\ninstead erroneously placed the burden on CMS and the Swann plain-\ntiffs to affirmatively show that the present inequities in facilities are\na vestige of official discrimination, i.e., causally related to the prior\nde jure system of segregation. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267.\n\nThe district court erred as a matter of law in foreclosing the devel-\nopment of evidence relevant to a proper vestige analysis. We must\ntherefore remand this portion of the case to permit the parties and the\ndistrict court to elicit the additional facts necessary to fully consider\nthe question of causation with respect to the current racial inequities\nin facilities. Because CMS has not been previously adjudged to have\nattained unitary status, the Capacchione plaintiffs are charged on\nremand with the burden of demonstrating that the vestiges of past de\njure racial discrimination in the context of the school system's facili-\nties have been eliminated \"root and branch\" to the extent practicable.15 15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15 The district court made no findings as to whether practicable reme-\ndies exist with respect to facilities. In light of the court's refusal to con-\nsider the Board's proposed five-year Remedial Plan, we cannot\ndetermine in the first instance whether practicable remedies to the current\ndisparities exist. We therefore remand to the district court for develop-\nment on this point. We note, however, that the Remedial Plan specifi-\ncally identifies disparities associated with race in baseline needs for\nschools' instructional materials and media centers, and the lack of any\nstandardized criteria to evaluate the adequacy of these resources. J.A.\n11037-38. The Plan proposes to achieve uniformity in resources across\nschools by imbalanced allocations that reflect the schools' current\nresource gaps and imbalances. J.A. 11038-40. Likewise, the Remedial\nPlan identifies disparities associated with race in the instructional facili-\nties, and proposes building replacements or renovating existing facilities\nfor sixteen schools that are either racially identifiable as black or are\nlocated in a predominantly black census tract. J.A. 11041-42. Uniform\nbuilding maintenance standards and procedures are proposed. J.A.\n11043. Monitoring, evaluation, and development of appropriate criteria\nfor evaluation are also proposed to maintain equity across the school sys-\ntem's resources and facilities. J.A. 11038-40, 11042-43.\n\n                   42\n\f3. Transportation\n\nSchool bus transportation was at the epicenter of the original\nSwann litigation, specifically the degree to which involuntary busing\ncould be used to implement a remedial desegregation decree. The\nSupreme Court in Swann, of course, approved busing as a \"normal\nand accepted tool of educational policy,\" 402 U.S. at 29, at least to\nthe extent that the rigors of time and distance would pose little risk\nto the affected students' health or to the educational process as a\nwhole. See id. at 30-31. In the intervening twenty-nine years, CMS\nhas taken the Court's license to heart; during the 1998-99 school year,\nfive of every six students in the school system rode a school bus.\n\nUpon review of the Green factor of transportation, Judge Potter\nconcluded that \"a court may grant unitary status when transportation\nis provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\" 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267. In\nother words, according to the district court, a school system achieves\nunitary status with respect to transportation once it provides access to\ntransportation non-discriminatorily to black and white children.\nBecause CMS provides all children, regardless of race, access to\ntransportation, Judge Potter concluded that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus with respect to this Green factor.\n\nWe must be mindful of the Supreme Court's command to consider\nthe interrelatedness of the various Green factors. See Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 491 (court must consider \"whether retention of judicial control\nis necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in\nother facets of the school system\"). In this context, we can only con-\nclude that the Green factor of transportation is so inextricably inter-\ntwined with the Green factors of student assignment and facilities that\nour vacatur on those issues also mandates vacatur on the factor of trans-\nportation.16\n           16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16 Pursuant to Freeman, the district court accepted the invitation of the\nBoard and the Swann plaintiffs to consider whether vestiges of official\ndiscrimination remain concerning the ancillary factors of student\nachievement and student discipline. The court found in the negative, con-\ncluding that CMS had attained unitary status in both areas.\n\nWith respect to the ancillary factor of student achievement, we must\nvacate Judge Potter's holding that unitary status had been achieved, and\n\n                    43\n\fThe Swann plaintiffs maintain and offer substantial record evidence\nthat the burdens of busing for desegregation purposes are being borne\ndisproportionately and unfairly by African-American children. Brief\nof Appellants at 31-32, 33-35; see Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298 (dis-\ntrict court commenting in initial stages of remediation that it did not\nintend \"to endorse or approve any future plan which puts the burden\nof desegregation primarily upon one race\"). Eighty percent of stu-\ndents who currently ride the bus as a result of a mandatory assignment\nare African-American. Judge Potter rejected any consideration of this\nevidence, holding that a school district has achieved unitary status\nwith respect to transportation as soon as it is provided on a race-\nneutral basis. The evidence, however, demonstrates the close interre-\nlationship of transportation with student assignment. In view of our\nconclusion that CMS is not yet unitary with regard to student assign-\nment, we think it is premature to relinquish control over transporta-\ntion at this stage. On remand, if the district court determines that CMS\nmust remain under court order to correct the current imbalances in\nstudent assignment, it should also retain control over transportation to\nensure that those imbalances are corrected in a way that is fair to all\nstudents.17\n          17\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwe do so on a basis similar to our analysis of the Green factor of trans-\nportation. Judge Potter found that disparities in student achievement\nexisted but that the disparities (1) were not vestiges of de jure segrega-\ntion and (2) could not be remedied by any practicable measure. Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 280-81. An analysis of disparities in student\nachievement may only be appropriate once the school system has\nachieved unitary status in other respects. See Swann, 306 F. Supp. at\n1309 (\"Until unlawful segregation is eliminated, it is idle to speculate\nwhether some of this [achievement] gap can be charged to racial differ-\nences or to `socio-economic-cultural' lag.\"). At the very least, as with\ntransportation, student achievement in this case is inextricably inter-\ntwined with the other Green factors, particularly student assignment.\nTherefore, having vacated certain of the district court's rulings on unitary\nstatus, including its ruling with respect to student assignment, we must\nalso vacate the district court's conclusion on student achievement.\n\nWe have reviewed and considered the district court's consideration of\nstudent discipline, and we affirm the district court's resolution as to this\nancillary factor.\n\n17 While the Remedial Plan does not specifically address transportation\nas a Green factor, it does propose siting new schools in a manner calcu-\n\n                  44\n\f4. Faculty\n\nOur analysis of this factor must take two concerns into account. We\nmust determine both whether CMS has generally eliminated the ves-\ntiges of discrimination in faculty assignment, and whether the teach-\ners assigned to predominantly black schools are of comparable quality\nto those teaching in schools with large numbers of white students.1818\nSee Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (final desegregation order directing\nthat the racial composition of faculty assigned to each school reflect\nthat of the system at large, with the proviso that \"the competence and\nexperience of teachers in formerly or recently black schools will not\nbe inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in the\nsystem\").\n\nThe evidence at trial demonstrated that CMS assigned its faculty\nin substantial compliance with the desegregation order at least until\n1992, when school principals were granted the leeway to actively\nrecruit new teachers without the strictures of maintaining a specific\nracial proportion. As a result of this gravitation from centralized to\nsite-based control of faculty assignments, a trend away from propor-\ntionality has emerged. In 1998-99, one-third of the 126 schools cov-\nered by the remedial decree had a proportion of black faculty\ndeviating more than ten percent from the system-wide norm (about\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nlated to promote racial balance in CMS. J.A. 11042. If CMS chooses\nsites for new schools that are more accessible to the majority of the black\npopulation, we presume that fewer black students would have to be\nbused to the suburbs for purposes of desegretation. A new approach to\nschool siting would address the vestiges of past discrimination, if such\nvestiges remain, in those areas in which CMS has not yet achieved uni-\ntary status.\n\n18 The district court considered a particular school to be racially imbal-\nanced if its proportion of African-American students varied more than\nfifteen percent from the district-wide average. In 1998-99, African-\nAmericans represented 42.7% of the elementary students in CMS, 41.7%\nof the middle school students, and 39.6% of the high school students.\nJ.A. 11574. An elementary school would therefore be designated\nimbalanced-black if more than 57.7% of its students are African-\nAmerican; conversely, if African-Americans constituted less than 27.7%\nof the student body, the school would be designated imbalanced-white.\n\n                  45\n\ftwenty-one percent). Prior to the 1992 change in policy, no more than\none-sixth of the schools had ever been so situated.\n\nWe are satisfied that the current trend toward faculty imbalance is\nneither a vestige of the dual system nor the product of subsequent dis-\ncrimination. There is no evidence that this trend results from legal or\nadministrative compulsion within CMS or from perceptions about the\ndesirability or undesirability of teaching positions in schools that\nserve students of predominantly one race. In short, we do not perceive\na causal relationship between past de jure segregation and the present\nassignment of faculty members to schools within CMS.19 19\n\nNor do we think that this trend toward more racially imbalanced\nfaculties has resulted in disparities in the quality of teaching, as mea-\nsured by the instructors' years of experience and post-graduate work.\nIndeed, there is no significant difference in experience between facul-\nties at imbalanced-black schools as compared to those that are\nimbalanced-white. Faculties at black schools are about one year less\nexperienced than the district-wide average, while faculties at white\nschools are correspondingly more seasoned. This disparity may\narouse some initial concerns, until one is informed that the typical\nCMS teacher has spent more than ten years in the classroom. The\nupshot is that black and white students alike are, with no meaningful\ndistinction, enjoying the benefits of their teachers' substantial experi-\nence.\n\nThe difference in post-graduate education between black-school\nand white-school faculties is more pronounced. For every three teach-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 Even if the pattern of faculty assignments were somehow shown to\nbe a vestige of past official discrimination, the evidence before the dis-\ntrict court casts substantial doubt upon the Board's ability to effect a\npracticable remedy. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 258-59:\n\n        CMS runs the risk of losing significant numbers of teachers if its\n        faculty assignment policies become too restrictive. . . . Another\n        practical problem faced by the district is the fact that it must con-\n        stantly hire thousands of new teachers in the midst of a national\n        teacher shortage . . . [which] is especially pronounced with\n        regard to black teachers, particularly in this region of the coun-\n        try.\n\n                   46\n\fers holding advanced degrees who ply their craft at imbalanced-white\nschools, there are only two similarly qualified teachers assigned to\nschools that are imbalanced-black. Compared to the district average,\nwhite schools have a somewhat larger proportion of these highly\ntrained instructors, while the allotment granted to black schools is\nslightly less than the norm.\n\nAlthough these facts give us reason for concern, we think it impru-\ndent to disturb the district court's conclusion that the trial evidence\naffirmatively disclosed no link between past discrimination and the\ncurrent asymmetry. Most revealing on this point is that, until now, the\nissue of teacher quality within CMS has not been contested. The 1970\ndesegregation order mandating equal competence and experience in\nfaculty assignments was not meant to remedy disparities then exist-\ning, but was instead intended to caution against future imbalances. In\nthe intervening thirty years, there is little indication that CMS has\nneglected to heed the warning inherent in that order.\n\nThe district court did not clearly err in concluding that the develop-\ning disparities in teacher assignments and any (perhaps superficial)\ndeficiency in the quality of instruction currently afforded African-\nAmerican children are unrelated to the de jure segregation once prev-\nalent in the school system. We therefore affirm the lower court's find-\ning that CMS has attained unitary status with respect to faculty.20\n                                                                  20\n\n5. Staff\n\nIn substantially the same manner as it spoke to the allocation of\nteachers, the final desegregation order provided that \"the internal\noperation of each school, and the assignment and management of\nschool employees, of course be conducted on a non-racial, non-\ndiscriminatory basis.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 269. Inasmuch as the\nSwann plaintiffs raised no challenge to the school system's compli-\nance with the desegregation order in this regard, the court below\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20 Although the Board's official position, as outlined in its Remedial\nPlan, is that remediable vestiges of de jure segregation do remain as to\nfaculty assignments and quality, the clear weight of the evidence is to the\ncontrary. The district court's failure to consider the Plan was therefore\nharmless in this narrow respect.\n\n                  47\n\ffound CMS to have achieved unitary status with regard to its support\nstaff. We agree, and we affirm that aspect of the district court's judg-\nment.\n\n6. Extracurricular activities\n\nAccording to the evidence at trial, African-American students in\nCMS participate in athletics and hold class office at a rate proportion-\nate to their numbers. These same students lag far behind, however,\nwhen it comes to participating in co-curricular clubs and honors pro-\ngrams. J.A. 11634. However, the scope of our inquiry concerning\nextracurricular activities is limited. We need only determine whether\nthe school system permits its students equal access to extracurricular\nactivities, without regard to race. Coalition to Save Our Children v.\nState Bd. of Educ. of Delaware, 90 F.3d 752, 768-69 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(citation omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 18-19 (\"[T]he first\nremedial responsibility of school authorities is to eliminate invidious\nracial distinctions. With respect to such matters as transportation, sup-\nporting personnel, and extracurricular activities, no more than this\nmay be necessary. . . . In these areas, normal administrative practice\nshould produce schools of like quality, facilities, and staffs.\").\n\nThe criterion of equal access is surely satisfied in this regard. Par-\nticipation in honors programs and co-curricular clubs is strictly volun-\ntary, and there is no evidence that the lack of participation by African-\nAmerican students in certain activities reflects the efforts of CMS to\nexclude them. We discern no error in the district court's conclusions\nregarding this Green factor, and we therefore affirm its finding that\nCMS has achieved unitary status with respect to extracurricular activ-\nities.\n\nC.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing, we conclude that the district court\nshould be affirmed in its determination of unitary status with respect\nto faculty, staff, extracurricular activities, and student discipline.\nHowever, we also conclude that we must vacate and remand for fur-\nther consideration in the areas of student assignment, facilities, trans-\nportation, and student achievement.\n\n                  48\n\fVolume 2 of 3\n\n                49\n\fIII.\n\nWe now turn to the question of whether the Board's expanded\nmagnet schools program violates the Constitution.\n\nEven if we had concluded that the district court was correct in\ndecreeing that CMS has now achieved unitary status in all respects,\nany preceding remedial measures could not be analyzed as if they had\nbeen taken by a \"de facto\" unitary school district. Prior to the decision\nbelow, no court had ever determined that CMS had attained unitary\nstatus as to any Green factor. As the Capacchione plaintiffs concede,\nJudge Potter's decision -- not some earlier event-- \"terminated [the]\ninjunction\" issued by Judge McMillan and affirmed by the Supreme\nCourt. Brief of Appellees at 3.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made it clear that unitary status is a legal\nconcept that has no \"fixed meaning or content\" independent of the\njudicial proceeding in which \"unitariness\" is conferred. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 486-87. The Court has consistently held that desegregation\ndecrees remain in effect until they are terminated by a court in unam-\nbiguous terms. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 244-46 (finding district\ncourt's prior determination of \"unitariness\" too ambiguous to dissolve\ndesegregation decree and emphasizing that litigants are entitled to a\n\"rather precise statement\" if a decree is to be terminated); Spangler,\n427 U.S. at 438-40 (holding that even an unconstitutional court order\nremains in effect until a \"definitive disposition\" is reached on the con-\n\n                   50\n\fstitutional objection). Thus, Judge Potter properly acknowledged that\nthe law would not support a judicial finding that a school district had\nattained unitary status at a point in time prior to the court's own uni-\ntariness determination. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (\"The\nCourt finds no legal basis for a finding of de facto unitary status that\nwould abrogate CMS's immunity retroactively. In other words, the\ntermination of court supervision cannot `relate back' to an earlier\ntime.\").\n\nJudge Potter nevertheless held that the expanded magnet schools\nprogram was \"ultra vires,\" beyond the scope of action authorized\nunder the series of injunctions and orders governing desegregation of\nCMS. Id. After holding that the magnet schools program exceeded the\nscope of these injunctions and orders, the district court proceeded to\nanalyze whether the program violated the Capacchione plaintiffs'\nconstitutional rights. Applying strict scrutiny, the court concluded that\nthe expanded magnet schools program could not be legally justified.\nId. at 287-90.\n\nWe review the district court's factual findings for clear error and\nits legal conclusions de novo. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474; United\nStates v. Texas, 158 F.3d 299, 306 n.8 (5th Cir. 1998); Little Rock\nSch. Dist. v. North Little Rock Sch. Dist., 109 F.3d 514, 516 (8th Cir.\n1997).\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we must reverse. In fact, the injunc-\ntions and orders governing this case specifically authorize every sig-\nnificant aspect of the expanded magnet schools program, including\nthe use of racial proportions in assigning students to magnet schools.\nFurthermore, the Board's obligation to obey these court orders insu-\nlates it from constitutional attack for actions taken in compliance with\nthem.\n\nA.\n\nMagnet schools are designed to achieve desegregation by offering\nsome kind of special program or curriculum that will attract students,\nregardless of race, from throughout a school district. See Missouri v.\nJenkins, 495 U.S. 33, 40 n.6 (1990); see also 20 U.S.C. § 7204 (1999)\n(a magnet school is \"a public elementary or secondary school . . . that\n\n                   51\n\foffers a special curriculum capable of attracting substantial numbers\nof students of different racial backgrounds\"). Magnets \"were first con-\nceived and developed in large, urban school districts seeking a volun-\ntary alternative to busing as a means of decreasing racial segregation.\"\nJ.A. 10654. Critical to the magnet school concept is voluntary choice\n-- students choose to attend magnet schools because of their desire\nfor the special programs such schools offer. Thus, magnet schools,\nwhen not permitted to become dominated by one race, act as \"incen-\ntives for parents to keep their children in the public school system and\nto send their children to integrated schools.\" J.A. 15509.\n\nSince the 1970s, school boards throughout the country have uti-\nlized magnet schools as part of desegregation plans that have been\nroutinely approved by the courts. See, e.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU.S. 267, 272 (1977) (Milliken II); Stell v. Savannah-Chatham\nCounty Bd. of Educ., 888 F.2d 82, 85-86 (11th Cir. 1989); Little Rock\nSch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 839 F.2d 1296,\n1309-12 (8th Cir. 1988); United States v. Yonkers Bd. of Educ., 837\nF.2d 1181, 1237-39 (2d Cir. 1987); Liddell v. Missouri, 731 F.2d\n1294, 1310-11 (8th Cir. 1984).\n\nAlmost invariably, magnet school programs include an assignment\npolicy that takes race into account \"to assure to the greatest extent\npossible that these voluntary attendance schools not work to under-\nmine the progress of desegregation.\" Davis v. East Baton Rouge Par-\nish Sch. Bd., 721 F.2d 1425, 1440 (5th Cir. 1983). Such a policy is\nnecessary to prevent magnet schools from \"serv[ing] as a haven for\nthose seeking to attend a school predominantly composed of their\nown race\". Morgan v. Kerrigan, 530 F.2d 401, 423 (1st Cir. 1976);\nsee also Jenkins v. Missouri, 942 F.2d 487, 488-89 (8th Cir. 1991);\nStell, 888 F.2d at 83; Little Rock Sch. Dist., 839 F.2d at 1311; Yonkers\nBd. of Educ., 837 F.2d at 1215; Liddell, 731 F.2d at 1310.\n\nThe various court decisions reflect a cautious enthusiasm for the\nutilization of magnet schools, both because such schools allow for\nmore flexibility in student assignment and because they rely more\nheavily on voluntary choice than mandatory busing. See, e.g., Jenkins,\n515 U.S. at 92 (\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging\nvoluntary movement of students within a school district in a pattern\nthat aids desegregation on a voluntary basis, without requiring exten-\n\n                   52\n\fsive busing and redrawing of district boundary lines.\").21\n                                                        21 Further, no\nauthority suggests that magnet programs with race-conscious assign-\nment policies constitute an inappropriate vehicle for achieving deseg-\nregation under a court-sponsored plan. Indeed, it is difficult to see\nhow a magnet program devised, with court approval, to eliminate ves-\ntiges of segregated schools could do so if school authorities were not\npermitted to control the racial composition of magnet school enroll-\nment.\n\nBy the 1970s, CMS had established some magnet schools, which\nit called \"optional schools.\" These early magnet schools had race-\nconscious assignment policies. See 379 F. Supp. at 1106, 1108; J.A.\n2489. Moreover, they offered two special curricula -- \"open\" and\n\"traditional\" -- both of which constituted \"very rigorous academic\nprogram[s]\" not offered in \"conventional schools.\" J.A. 2489, 15683.\nJudge McMillan approved these magnet schools, including their race-\nconscious assignment policies. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105-106.\n\nIn 1992, the Board expanded its magnet schools program into a\ndistrict-wide system with a wider range of curricular choices. In the\nexpanded magnet schools program, the Board retained the curricula\nfirst available in the early magnet or \"optional\" schools -- the \"open\"\ncurriculum, emphasizing \"interdisciplinary approaches,\" and the \"tra-\nditional\" curriculum, featuring a \"highly structured program.\" J.A.\n16722-23. Furthermore, six of the early magnets that offered such\ncurricula prior to 1992 -- Myers Park, Elizabeth, Hawthorne, Irwin\nAvenue, Piedmont, and West Charlotte -- continue to do so today\nunder the expanded magnet schools program. Compare J.A. 13448,\n13529-40, 15683 (pre-1992 \"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets) with\nJ.A. 16722-23 (1998-99 \"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets); see also\nJ.A. 10061 (report indicating that pre-1992 magnet schools were\nincorporated into the 1992 expanded magnet schools program).22   22\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21 The courts' caution essentially anticipates the position of the Swann\nplaintiffs in this case: that magnet schools are insufficiently desegrega-\ntive at best, and that at worst they simply provide an \"escape hatch\" for\nwhite students who would otherwise attend majority black schools, leav-\ning those majority black schools even more segregated than they had\nbeen before.\n\n22 Judge Potter recognized that the optional schools \"were similar to\ntoday's magnet schools,\" both having countywide enrollment and a racial\n\n                   53\n\fRace is considered in assigning students to the magnet schools\ninstituted under the 1992 expanded program, just as it was in assign-\ning students to the original magnet or optional schools. See 379 F.\nSupp. at 1108. Specifically, under the expanded program, CMS allo-\ncates 40% of the seats in its magnet schools for black students and\n60% for students of other races. This ratio reflects the student popula-\ntion of the school system, which is approximately 41.0% black,\n52.2% white, 3.7% Asian, 2.5% Hispanic, and .5% American Indian.23\n                                                                23\nCMS generally assigns students to its magnet schools using two paral-\nlel lotteries, one for black students and one for students of other races.\nWhen there has been insufficient interest from black students to fill\nthe seats allocated to them in a particular school, CMS has sometimes\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbalancing target.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d. at 286. He nonetheless\nconcluded that the schools established after 1992 under the expanded\nmagnet schools program \"differ from optional schools in that [the new]\nmagnets offer specialized curricula and thereby confer a benefit above\nand beyond the regular academic program.\" Id. at 286-87 n. 49. But\nnothing in the record supports this view. To the contrary, assuming\narguendo that \"specialized curricula\" constitute a \"benefit,\" the magnet\nschools instituted after 1992 provide precisely the same \"benefit\" as the\npre-1992 \"optional schools.\" See J.A. 10552 (proposed 1992 pupil\nassignment plan recommending continuation of six magnet schools\nalready in place); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter noting that magnet schools\nwere called \"optional schools\" prior to 1992); J.A. 10651 (Summary of\nFindings From Research on Magnet Schools explaining that \"[o]ur\noptional schools function as magnet schools\"); J.A. 13606, 15581 (Stolee\nPlan explaining that \"[the traditional schools presently existing in\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg are good examples\" of curriculum specialty\nschools, \"sometimes called magnet schools\"). After all, it was only\nbecause the optional schools did offer certain \"specialized curricula\" that\nparents (including Michael Grant, one of the Capacchione plaintiffs, J.A.\n2489) were willing, well prior to the 1992 expanded magnet schools pro-\ngram, to enroll their children in desegregated optional schools. See J.A.\n13641, 15616. In fact, the original six \"open\" and \"traditional\" schools\nremain among CMS's more heavily subscribed magnets. See J.A. 10292-\n340. Myers Park Traditional, for example, had 245 students on its wait-\ning list for the 1998-99 school year. See J.A. 2159.\n\n23 For simplicity, we often refer within to non-African-American stu-\ndents in the magnet schools as \"white.\"\n\n                  54\n\frefused to allow students of other races to fill those slots. Thus, race\nmay affect a student's chances of being assigned to a magnet school.\n\nB.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs contend that the expanded magnet\nschools program violates the Equal Protection Clause. Recognizing,\nif only implicitly, the difficulty in maintaining that actions taken pur-\nsuant to court orders violate the Constitution, they principally argue\nthat the expanded magnet program was not implemented under the\ncourt orders governing this case. Specifically, they first contend that\nthe Board's increased reliance on magnet schools constituted a \"vol-\nuntary desegregation plan implemented to counteract demographic\nchange,\" rather than a good faith effort to eliminate the vestiges of\ndiscrimination as required by the existing desegregation orders. Sec-\nond, they argue that the expanded program's race-conscious assign-\nment lottery violated the desegregation orders. Finally, they maintain\nthat even if CMS expanded its magnet schools program pursuant to\nand in compliance with governing court orders, strict scrutiny none-\ntheless applies and requires that the program be held unconstitutional.\nWe consider each contention in turn.\n\n1.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs note that implementation of the\nexpanded magnet schools program followed on the heels of demo-\ngraphic changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. As discussed in\nconnection with student assignment, supra, the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg area has experienced in recent decades both strong pop-\nulation growth overall and intensive out-migration from the city to the\nsuburbs and from older, inner-ring suburbs to newer suburbs in the far\nnorthern and southern areas of the county. For these reasons, the\nCapacchione plaintiffs insist that the expanded magnet program was\nnecessarily a response to demographic change rather than a true\nattempt to remedy past discrimination.\n\nWe cannot agree. First, Judge Potter \"accept[ed] that the school\nsystem was acting to . . . remedy[ ] the effects of past racial discrimi-\nnation\" in expanding the number of magnet schools in 1992. Capac-\nchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. Ample record evidence supports this\n\n                   55\n\ffinding. See, e.g., J.A. 2716 (testimony of John Murphy, former CMS\nSuperintendent, that 1992 plan to expand the magnet school program\nwas among the \"creative strategies we could come up with to stay in\ncompliance with the court order\"); J.A. 3869-74 (testimony of Jeff\nSchiller, former assistant superintendent for research, assessment, and\nplanning for CMS, explaining that the 1992 student assignment plan,\nincluding the expanded magnet schools program, \"had the same\nobjectives as the one that it was going to replace, maintaining the\ncourt order,\" and that the objective of the expanded magnet program\nspecifically was \"to maintain the integration of schools through vol-\nuntary means\"); J.A. 15503-05 (1993 letter from CMS to the U.S.\nDepartment of Education discussing Judge McMillan's 1974 order\nand identifying the creation of additional magnet schools as among\nthe \"more effective ways . . . [to] meet[ ] the guidelines established\nby the Court\"); J.A. 13607, 15582 (Stolee Plan recommendation that\n\"[the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school desegregation plan should be\ngradually changed from a mandatory plan with little voluntarism to\na voluntary plan with few mandatory facets\").\n\nFurthermore, the dichotomy the Capacchione plaintiffs suggest\nbetween \"counter[ing] demographic change,\" on the one hand, and\nremedying past discrimination, on the other, oversimplifies both the\nlaw of school desegregation, particularly the Supreme Court's deci-\nsions in Green, Swann, and Freeman, and the practical reality of\nachieving desegregation in a large urban school district. From the\nearly stages of the Swann litigation, it has been understood that demo-\ngraphic patterns would complicate the process of school desegrega-\ntion. Indeed, remedies like school busing and satellite attendance\nzones would never have been necessary in the first place if the\ndemography of the community were not an obstacle to desegregation.\nIn a sense, Swann's basic teaching is that the Constitution sometimes\nrequires schools to \"counter demograph[y]\" in order to achieve deseg-\nregation. The Swann Court noted that the process of \"local authorities\n. . . meet[ing] their constitutional obligations\" had \"been rendered\nmore difficult by changes . . . in the structure and patterns of commu-\nnities, the growth of student population, [and] movement of families.\"\n402 U.S. at 14. The Court expressed concern that\"segregated residen-\ntial patterns . . . [would] lock the school system into the mold of sepa-\nration of the races.\" Id. at 21. Thus, CMS simply followed the\n\n                  56\n\fSupreme Court's guidance in Swann in regarding demographic\nchange as a problem inhibiting its progress toward unitary status.24\n                                                                  24\n\nMoreover, Freeman simply did not hold, as the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs necessarily imply, that demographic changes in a metropolitan\narea independently eliminate the vestiges of past discrimination. Nor\ndoes Freeman bar courts from targeting racial isolation resulting in\nsignificant part from \"private choice,\" if that isolation is also a vestige\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n24 The Capacchione plaintiffs contend that, given the obvious concern\nof school officials with demographic changes, \"CMS could not have\nbeen motivated by any desire to comply with its court-ordered duty to\neradicate vestiges of segregation.\" Brief of Appellees at 85. But this\nstands the analysis on its head. A court determines from the effect of their\nacts, not from their motives, whether school authorities comply with a\ndesegregation decree. See Wright v. Council of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451,\n462 (1972) (\"It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the\nsole or dominant motivation behind choices of a group of legislators, and\nthe same may be said of the choices of a school board. . . . Thus we have\nfocused upon the effect -- not the purpose or motivation -- of a school\nboard's action in determining whether it is a permissible method of dis-\nmantling a dual system.\") (internal quotations marks omitted). Moreover,\neven if motivation were relevant, the argument would fail. A fair reading\nof the record demonstrates that although school officials were obviously\naware of the demographic shifts, they viewed these shifts as an obstacle\nto achieving compliance with the Swann orders and to eliminating the\nvestiges of discrimination in the school system, not as the condition that\nitself necessitated a remedy. See, e.g., J.A. 13597-98, 15572-73 (Stolee\nPlan identifying \"a growing and moving population\" as one of several\nfactors creating instability in student assignment under the pre-1992 sys-\ntem of pairing and satelliting); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter from CMS to the\nU.S. Department of Education listing \"demographic and residential pat-\nterns\" as one of several increasing strains on the pairing system); J.A.\n2712 (testimony of former CMS Superintendent John Murphy that \"[w]e\nreally weren't going to be bringing about desegregation and racially bal-\nanced schools unless we began to address the issue of housing at the\nsame time.\"). The Board may have chosen sites for new schools in\nresponse to, or even in furtherance of, these demographic trends, see\nsupra, but in any event the Board also clearly evidenced awareness that\nthe population changes, particularly the greater distance between white\nand black population centers, would put a greater strain on the process\nof desegregation.\n\n                   57\n\fof past discrimination. The effect of such a holding in Freeman would\nhave been to overrule Green, which the Supreme Court did not pur-\nport to do. In Green, even though the school board allowed every stu-\ndent \"freedom of choice\" as to which school to attend, the formerly\nblack school remained all black and the formerly white school\nremained predominantly white -- wholly as a result, in some sense,\nof this \"private choice.\" The Green Court held that, although the pri-\nvate choices of students and their families were responsible for the\ncontinuing racial isolation of the schools' student populations, that\nfact did not preclude a finding that the racial isolation was also a ves-\ntige of past discrimination. Indeed, the Court held not only that it was\npermissible for the school board to take further action to desegregate,\nbut that the board was required to take further action in order to fulfill\nits \"affirmative duty\" to desegregate. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\n\nAlthough Freeman recognized that, at a certain point in the process\nof desegregation, a court may determine that present racial isolation\ncannot be considered a by-product of the past regime of segregation,\nthe case does not require -- or even empower -- a school board\nunder a judicial desegregation order to make that determination on its\nown. Rather, so long as CMS was under court order to desegregate,\nit was required to treat racial isolation in its schools as a vestige of\nsegregation, and to take appropriate action to eliminate that vestige.\nSee Swann, 402 U.S. at 26.\n\n2.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs next contend that the expanded magnet\nprogram's race-conscious assignment policy violated the desegrega-\ntion orders governing this case. With this argument, Judge Potter\nagreed, concluding that \"the way that CMS's magnet program uses\nrace . . . is significantly different from any assignment policy ordered\nor approved of in Swann,\" and thus constituted a \"material departure\"\nfrom the governing desegregation orders. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d at 286-87.\n\nThat holding constituted clear error. Actually, Judge McMillan spe-\ncifically authorized and incorporated into his decree a race-conscious\nassignment policy for \"appropriately integrated optional schools.\" 379\nF. Supp. at 1103. The policy provided:\n\n                   58\n\f        Strict and central control must be exercised over all admis-\n        sions (reassignments) to each optional school in order to\n        fulfill the necessary ends that these schools be open to all\n        county residents and be integrated by grade at or above\n        approximately a 20% black ratio. Reassignments to optional\n        schools must not jeopardize the racial composition of any\n        other school.\n\n        Guidelines and central monitoring by the Pupil Assign-\n        ment staff with the respective school principals are to be\n        drawn up. Capacities and allocation of maximum numbers\n        of students that may be drawn from each other school atten-\n        dance area, by race, are to be designated. The actual enroll-\n        ment of the optional school may have to be guided by its\n        racial composition and by the number drawn from each\n        other school area, not by considerations of space and pro-\n        gram only.\n\nId. at 1108 (emphasis added).25\n                             25\n\nMoreover, one need look no further than Chief Justice Burger's\nopinion for the Supreme Court in Swann to find explicit sanction of\nthe use of racial \"ratios\" or proportions in assigning students to\nschools:\n\n        School authorities are traditionally charged with broad\n        power to formulate and implement education policy and\n        might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare\n        students to live in a pluralistic society each school should\n        have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting\n        the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an\n        educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers\n        of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional\n        violation, however, that would not be within the authority of\n        a federal court.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n25 In accord with this court-approved policy, from 1975 to 1991, prior\nto expansion of the magnet schools plan, CMS continued to use a race-\nconscious lottery system to control enrollment in optional, or magnet,\nschools. See J.A. 2489-91, 2822-23, 14502, 16885-89.\n\n                  59\n\f402 U.S. at 16 (emphasis added).\n\nJudge McMillan's orders also repeatedly endorse the Board's\npower and duty to maintain control over the racial composition of the\nschools in order to eliminate the vestiges of the segregated system\n\"root and branch.\" For instance, in 1970 Judge McMillan mandated:\n\n        That the defendants maintain a continuing control over the\n        race of children in each school . . . and maintain the racial\n        make-up of each school (including any new and any re-\n        opened schools) to prevent any school from becoming\n        racially identifiable. . . . The duty imposed by the law and\n        by this order is the desegregation of schools and the mainte-\n        nance of that condition. . . . The defendants are encouraged\n        to use their full “know-how” and resources to attain the\n        results above described, and thus to achieve the constitu-\n        tional end by any means at their disposal. The test is not the\n        method or plan, but the results.\n\n311 F. Supp. at 268-69 (emphasis added and emphasis omitted); see\nalso 475 F. Supp. at 1342 (approving counsel's statement that \"if this\nBoard of Education chose to run an integrated school system on the\nbasis of preconceived ratios, it has that constitutional right\") (empha-\nsis added); 318 F. Supp. at 801 (ordering \"[t]hat `freedom of choice'\nor `freedom of transfer' may not be allowed by the Board if the cumu-\nlative effect of any given transfer or group of transfers is to increase\nsubstantially the degree of segregation in the school from which the\ntransfer is requested or in the school to which the transfer is desired\").\n\nThus, even if Judge McMillan had not specifically approved a race-\nconscious assignment policy for magnet schools, the Board's adop-\ntion of the 60-40 formula and lottery in the expanded magnet program\nwould not be an \"ultra vires\" act. Rather, that policy would fall within\nthe Board's broad discretion, recognized by both Judge McMillan and\nthe Supreme Court in Swann, to fashion appropriate remedies in light\nof the particular needs of its pupils and the school system's experi-\nence with other desegregation tools.2626\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n26 Judge McMillan's orders and the Supreme Court's opinion in Swann\ndid consistently signal concern with the imposition of racial proportions\n\n                   60\n\fJudge Potter's conclusion to the contrary simply cannot be recon-\nciled with the Supreme Court opinion in Swann and Judge McMil-\nlan's decrees. The race-conscious assignment policy constitutes a\nnecessary safeguard against the risk that unchecked transfers to mag-\nnet schools could increase the number of racially identifiable schools\nin violation of the Board's continuing obligation under the desegrega-\ntion orders. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105 (\"Racially identifiable schools\nmay not be operated.\"). In that vein, the Capacchione plaintiffs' own\nexpert on school desegregation, Dr. David Armor, agreed that racial\nquotas are permissible in a desegregation plan. J.A. 3627. Dr. Armor\ntestified that \"race is an integral part of pairing, of satelliting, of mag-\nnet schools, of running lotteries for magnet schools. The entire plan\nis predicated on race and race controls, because that's the only way\nyou can meet the court order and to have an effective plan is to\nemploy race requirements and racial quotas basically for all schools.\"\nJ.A. 3434.\n\nNor can Judge Potter's disapproval of the expanded magnet\nschools program be reconciled with other court-approved aspects of\nthe CMS desegregation plan. For example, the magnet schools assign-\nment policy takes race into account in much the same way as the\nBoard's majority-to-minority transfer policy, which was also specifi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nor ratios by federal courts. That concern, however, is rooted in the prob-\nlem of federal courts exceeding their remedial discretion, not in any\nobjection to the use of racial proportions or ratios by school boards in\ntheir desegregation plans. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that, \"[t]he\nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of\nthe school system as a whole,\" but went on to conclude that \"the very\nlimited use made of mathematical ratios was within the equitable reme-\ndial discretion of the District Court.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25. That this\nconcern with ratios is rooted in the limits of judicial power to order\nremedial action, not in the impropriety of using racial proportions to rem-\nedy the vestiges of segregation, is nowhere more apparent than in Chief\nJustice Burger's statement in Swann. There the Chief Justice noted that\nwhile in certain circumstances it might be inappropriate for a federal\ncourt to require adherence to \"a prescribed ratio of Negro to white stu-\ndents reflecting\" the population of the \"district as a whole\", it would be\n\"within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities\" to do so. Id.\nat 16.\n\n                   61\n\fcally authorized by the governing desegregation orders. Under the\ntransfer policy, a student in the racial majority in his current school\ncould freely transfer to a school in which he would be in the racial\nminority. A white student in a majority white school, for example,\ncould freely transfer to a majority black school, but that same student\ncould be denied admission to a different majority white school, solely\non the basis of a rigid 50% racial ceiling. Meanwhile, a black student\nat a majority black school could freely transfer into the same majority\nwhite school to which the white student might be denied admission.\nThe Supreme Court approved this use of majority-to-minority transfer\npolicies as \"a useful part of every desegregation plan\" and \"an indis-\npensable remedy.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 26.\n\nJudge Potter misread the orders and injunctions governing this case\nby focusing solely on isolated words and phrases to conclude that the\ndesegregation decrees \"firmly rejected the use of rigid racial quotas.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 286. Actually, in the same paragraph\nthat Judge McMillan held that \"[f]ixed ratios of pupils in particular\nschools will not be set\" by the court, he also held that \"efforts should\nbe made [by the school board] to reach a 71-29 ratio in the various\nschools so that there will be no basis for contending that one school\nis racially different from the others.\" 306 F. Supp. at 1312 (emphasis\nadded). Judge Potter transmuted this statement -- a requirement that\nthe Board make \"efforts\" to \"reach a 71-29 ratio\" -- into a prohibition\nagainst the Board assigning students to schools on the basis of that\nfixed ratio. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 286. We cannot\naccept this reading of Judge McMillan's order. Taken as a whole, this\nparagraph provides some of the clearest evidence that Judge McMil-\nlan not only authorized the Board to use fixed ratios in assigning stu-\ndents to schools but encouraged it to do so. Recognizing the\nimpracticability of adopting a court-ordered, system-wide racial bal-\nance to which all schools must adhere, Judge McMillan did observe\nthat \"variations from that [71-29 ratio] may be unavoidable.\" 306 F.\nSupp. at 1312. But that statement imposes no limitations on the scope\nof permissible Board action. Rather, it suggests that \"variations\" were\nacceptable only because they were \"unavoidable.\"\n\nIndeed, the Board could not have accomplished what the desegre-\ngation orders required it to accomplish without \"using race\" in the\nway that it \"used race\" in the context of the expanded magnet schools\n\n                  62\n\fprogram. In the 1970 order that was affirmed by the Supreme Court,\nJudge McMillan decreed \"[t]hat pupils of all grades be assigned in\nsuch a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various\ngrade levels have about the same proportion of black and white stu-\ndents.\" 311 F. Supp. at 268. We cannot fathom how the Board could\nset out to achieve \"about the same proportion of black and white stu-\ndents\" in each grade level in each of its over one hundred schools\nwithout employing fixed racial ratios as the central components of its\nstudent assignment plan. Neither, apparently, could Judge McMillan.\n\nTo achieve \"about the same proportion,\" the Board necessarily had\nto set fixed upper and lower limits on the proportion of white and\nblack students it would permit in each grade in each school. Only\nwith these fixed racial proportions as its lodestars could the Board\nassign students to schools, and approve or deny individual requests to\ntransfer. The Board could never have justified a denial of a transfer\nrequest without having a fixed conception of how few white or black\nstudents in a particular school would be too few.\n\nIn sum, contrary to Judge Potter's conclusion, Judge McMillan\nspecifically authorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assign-\ning students to magnet schools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1104. Further-\nmore, even without such specific authorization, the broad discretion\ngranted the Board by the Supreme Court's opinion in Swann and by\nthe other court orders and injunctions governing this case permitted\nCMS to fashion magnet schools with racially balanced enrollments.\nThe decrees make plain that ratios based on race were among the\n\"means\" by which the Board was authorized\"to achieve the constitu-\ntional end\" of desegregation.\n\n3.\n\nFinally, the Capacchione plaintiffs maintain that, even if CMS\nadministered the expanded magnet schools program pursuant to and\nin conformity with the governing desegregation decrees, CMS vio-\nlated the Constitution in doing so. Judge Potter rejected this argument,\nas do we.\n\na.\n\nIn fact, court-ordered remedial action cannot be found violative of\nthe Constitution. Rather, as Judge Potter recognized, actions taken by\n\n                  63\n\fCMS pursuant to the desegregation decrees are immune from consti-\ntutional attack. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (\"CMS enjoys\nimmunity from liability for any actions it took consistent with the\nCourt's injunction.\").\n\nThe Supreme Court has clearly and unequivocally proclaimed that\n\"persons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdic-\ntion are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or reversed,\neven if they have proper grounds to object to the order.\" GTE Syl-\nvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union of the United States, 445 U.S. 375,\n386 (1980) (emphasis added); see also W.R. Grace & Co. v. Local\nUnion 759, 461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983). Under this \"established doc-\ntrine,\" GTE, 445 U.S. at 386, an injunction unconstitutional on its\nface must nonetheless be obeyed. See Walker v. City of Birmingham,\n388 U.S. 307, 317 (1967). \"[D]isobedience of such an outstanding\norder of a federal court subjects the violator to contempt even though\nhis constitutional claim might be later upheld.\" Spangler, 427 U.S. at\n439. Thus, so long as CMS acts -- as it has -- to desegregate its\nschools in accordance with existing injunctive orders, its actions can-\nnot be challenged as unconstitutional.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has twice expressly held that school\nboards under court orders to desegregate must comply with those\norders until absolved of that obligation by a subsequent court order,\neven when the existing desegregation order is improper or unneces-\nsary. In Spangler, the Court concluded that the district court exceeded\nits remedial discretion when it ordered the Pasadena school district to\nreconfigure its student attendance zones annually so that there would\nbe \"no majority of any minority\" in any school. 427 U.S. at 434-35.\nDespite the impropriety of this order, the Court held that the school\nboard was obliged to obey it until it was properly and explicitly modi-\nfied by a court. See id. at 438-40.\n\nSimilarly, in Dowell, the Court refused to interpret an arguably\nambiguous court order as having terminated the desegregation decree\npreviously entered against the Oklahoma City school board. Instead,\nthe Court remanded the case to the district court for a clear determina-\ntion of \"whether the Board made a sufficient showing of constitu-\ntional compliance . . . to allow the injunction to be dissolved.\" 498\nU.S. at 249. In doing so, the Court explained that judicial orders carry\n\n                  64\n\fbinding authority until they are modified or dissolved and admon-\nished district courts to provide the parties with a \"precise statement\"\nwhen modifying or dissolving a desegregation decree. Id. at 246; see\nalso Dayton Bd. of Educ. v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 421 (\"a school\nboard and a school constituency which attempt to comply with a\n[desegregation] plan to the best of their ability should not be penal-\nized\").\n\nIn short, the Capacchione plaintiffs could have sought to modify\nor dissolve the Swann orders as inconsistent with their rights under\nthe Constitution; what they could not do is obtain an injunction, or\ndeclaration, that a party compelled to adhere to those orders violated\nthe Constitution in doing so. CMS's obligation to follow the desegre-\ngation orders and injunctions in this case provides it with a complete\ndefense to the Capacchione plaintiffs' challenge to the expanded\nmagnet schools program.\n\nb.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs ignore the controlling authority set\nforth above and instead rely on inapposite case law in attempting to\nestablish that Board actions taken pursuant to court-ordered desegre-\ngation decrees can be held unconstitutional.\n\nSpecifically, they rely on recent decisions finding voluntary, race-\nconscious magnet school programs (not developed under a governing\ndesegregation order) unconstitutional. See Eisenberg v. Montgomery\nCounty Pub. Sch., 197 F.3d 123, 125 (4th Cir. 1999); Tuttle v. Arling-\nton County Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698 (4th Cir. 1999); see also Wess-\nmann v. Gittens, 160 F.3d 790 (1st Cir. 1998). In fact, in those cases,\nthe courts emphasized that the school system had not been under a\ncourt order to desegregate, see Eisenberg, 197 F.3d at 124, and had\nadopted a magnet program \"not to remedy past discrimination, but\nrather to promote racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity.\" Tuttle,\n195 F.3d at 700 (emphasis added); see also Wessman, 160 F.3d at 792\n(noting that prior to instituting its magnet program the school system\n\"had achieved unitariness in the area of student assignments\" and that\n\"the district court thereupon relinquished control over\" that area).\nIndeed, in Eisenberg we endorsed the permissibility of race-based\nclassifications \"in situations,\" like that at hand, \"where past constitu-\n\n                   65\n\ftional violations require race-based remedial action.\" 197 F.3d at 130\n(citing Swann, 402 U.S. at 1); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795.\n\nThe distinction between a unitary school system and a school sys-\ntem under court order to desegregate is, from a legal standpoint, fun-\ndamental. Furthermore, as discussed supra, it is the judicial finding\nof unitary status, not any particular action by the school board or con-\ndition in the school system, upon which the distinction turns. Of\ncourse, for a formerly segregated school system, the attainment of\nunitary status reflects years or decades of gradual change, not an over-\nnight shift in policy or outlook. Although CMS will not look much\ndifferent the day it becomes unitary than it will have looked the previ-\nous day, attainment of unitary status triggers significant legal conse-\nquences. In a non-unitary school system, all one-race or\npredominantly one-race schools are presumed to be vestiges of segre-\ngation, and the burden is on the challenging party to show that those\nschools are nondiscriminatory. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26 (\"The court\nshould scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school\nauthorities will be to satisfy the court that their racial composition is\nnot the result of present or past discriminatory action on their part.\").\nOnce a court has declared a school system unitary, on the other hand,\nthe presumption is that the vestiges of segregation have been elimi-\nnated, and a plaintiff seeking to demonstrate a constitutional violation\non the basis of the existence of one-race or predominantly one-race\nschools must \"prove discriminatory intent on the part of the school\nboard.\" Riddick, 784 F.2d at 537.\n\nAs Judge Potter recognized, see Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at\n285, CMS implemented and administered its expanded magnet\nschools program prior to ever achieving unitary status and while still\nunder court order to remedy the vestiges of segregation. Therefore,\nrecent decisions, like Eisenberg and Tuttle, addressing the constitu-\ntionality of magnet school assignment policies in unitary school sys-\ntems not under court order, are simply inapposite here.\n\nMoreover, even if Tuttle and Eisenberg generally applied to gov-\nernmental acts performed pursuant to remedial desegregation order\n(which they do not), the Board's expanded magnet schools program\nwould withstand constitutional scrutiny. This is so because if a prece-\ndent of the Supreme Court \"has direct application in a case,\" inferior\n\n                  66\n\fcourts must follow that precedent \"even if later cases appear to call\nit into question, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of\noverruling its own decisions.\" See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203,\n237 (1997).\n\nThere could hardly be a clearer case for application of this princi-\nple. Here the Supreme Court's Swann decision itself constitutes\ndirectly controlling precedent. In Swann, the Court concluded that\nCMS could be constitutionally required to make efforts \"to reach a\n71-29 ratio\" in the schools under its authority, and to assign students\n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at var-\nious grade levels have about the same proportion of black and white\nstudents.\" See 402 U.S. at 23-25 (approving Judge McMillan's order).\nIndeed, the Supreme Court again noted in Freeman that its decision\nin Swann specifically approved racial balancing by CMS to achieve\nthe remedial end of eliminating the vestiges of segregation. 503 U.S.\nat 493 (In Swann, \"[w]e confirmed that racial balance in school\nassignments was a necessary part of the remedy in the circumstances\nthere presented.\"). Under the principle articulated in Agostini, only\nthe Supreme Court itself can modify the decrees in this case to pro-\nhibit what Swann so clearly permitted.\n\nC.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Swann is the law of the case; it\nmust be followed. But more than just the law of this case, for almost\nthirty years Swann also has functioned as a blueprint for school\ndesegregation in school districts throughout this Nation. As long as\nSwann is controlling law, and as long as the Board acts pursuant to\nthe Swann desegregation orders -- as it did in implementing the\nexpanded magnet schools program -- it cannot be held to have vio-\nlated the Constitution.\n\nIV.\n\nJudge Potter also enjoined CMS from \"assigning children to\nschools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through\nrace-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that deny\nstudents an equal footing based on race.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d at 294. In considering the propriety of an injunction, we review\n\n                  67\n\ffactual findings only for clear error, but the \"district court's applica-\ntion of legal principles . . . presents a legal question reviewed de\nnovo.\" North Carolina v. City of Virginia Beach, 951 F.2d 596, 601\n(4th Cir. 1992). Given our holding that CMS has not yet reached uni-\ntary status and did not violate the constitutional rights of the Capac-\nchione plaintiffs by consideration of race in its expanded magnet\nschools program, there is no legal basis for the district court's injunc-\ntion. Accordingly, we must vacate it.\n\nMoreover, because \"federal court decrees must directly address and\nrelate to the constitutional violation itself,\" Milliken, 433 U.S. at 282,\nwe would be compelled to vacate the injunction as overly broad even\nif some form of injunctive relief had been warranted. The expanded\nmagnet schools program was the only CMS action that the district\ncourt found to violate the Constitution -- Judge Potter did not con-\nsider the constitutionality of any other method of student assignment\nor resource allocation. Yet the injunction by its terms encompasses\nany consideration of race by CMS in student assignment or allocation\nof educational benefits that \"den[ies] students an equal footing.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 294. The injunction thus goes much\nfarther than simply prohibiting CMS from reinstituting the expanded\nmagnet schools program and its race-conscious assignment policy.\nWe have repeatedly held similar injunctions too broad, explaining that\n\"[a]lthough injunctive relief should be designed to grant the relief\nneeded to remedy the injury to the prevailing party, it should not go\nbeyond the extent of the established violation.\" Hayes, 10 F.3d at 217;\nsee also Tuttle, 195 F.3d at 708.\n\nIf the district court determines on remand, based on the standards\nset forth herein, that CMS has attained unitary status, it may issue an\ninjunction only to the extent that it concludes that CMS is likely to\npersist in current practices that would violate the Constitution if\nundertaken outside of the remedial context. See United States v. Ore-\ngon State Med. Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952). Even then, the dis-\ntrict court should be reluctant to issue such an injunction because \"the\nultimate objective\" of federal court involvement in school desegrega-\ntion has always been \"to return school districts to the control of local\nauthorities.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. Absent compelling evidence\nto the contrary, it must be assumed that CMS, when it is found to\nhave achieved unitary status, will act in conformity with the law.\n\n                   68\n\fV.\n\nIn addition to injunctive relief, the district court awarded nominal\ndamages of one dollar to the Capacchione family \"to vindicate the\nconstitutional rights of children denied an equal footing in applying\nto magnet schools.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. Because we\nhold that the expanded magnet schools program did not violate the\nConstitution, we must also vacate this nominal damages award.\n\nVI.\n\nThe district court also awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs\n$1,499,016.47 plus interest in attorney's fees, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1988. See Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 80 F. Supp.\n2d 557 (W.D.N.C. 1999) (amended by orders of December 16, 1999,\nJ.A. 1313-15, and March 6, 2000, J.A. 1356-62). Under that statute,\na court in a civil rights case \"may allow the prevailing party, other\nthan the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the\ncosts.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nIt appears that the district court principally based the award of\nattorney's fees on the Capacchione plaintiffs' success in obtaining\nnominal damages and injunctive relief. Because we have vacated\nthose awards, we must vacate the award of attorney's fees as well. As\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs recognize, it is \"self-evident\" that they\ncannot recover fees \"if this court reverses the order appealed from.\"\nBrief of Appellees at 113 n.51.\n\nMoreover, we would vacate the fee award even if it were based on\nthe district court's declaration that CMS had achieved unitary status.\nOur affirmance of a portion of that declaration -- that CMS has\nachieved unitary status with respect to four of the eight Green factors\nit considered -- does not entitle the Capacchione plaintiffs to attor-\nney's fees. In order to be considered a \"prevailing party\" under\n§ 1988, the party seeking fees must have obtained \"an enforceable\njudgment, consent decree, or settlement.\" S-1 & S-2 v. State Bd. of\nEduc., 21 F.3d 49, 51 (4th Cir. 1994) (en banc). Additionally, there\nmust be some defendant in the case who has been \"prevailed against,\"\nFarrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 109 (1992), with a resulting \"material\nalteration of the legal relationship\" between that defendant and the\n\n                   69\n\fparty seeking fees. Id. at 111. In obtaining a declaration that the\nBoard has achieved unitary status as to four Green factors, the Capac-\nchione plaintiffs have not obtained \"an enforceable judgment, consent\ndecree, or settlement\"; they have not \"prevailed against\" CMS; nor\nhave they effected a \"material alteration of the legal relationship\"\nbetween the parties.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Capacchione plaintiffs succeed on remand\nin proving that CMS has achieved unitary status in all respects, they\nwould not, for these same reasons, be entitled to attorney's fees. A\ndeclaration of unitary status merely restores the parties to the status\nquo prior to the issuance of the desegregation decree. Such a declara-\ntion would not constitute \"an enforceable judgment\" for the Capacch-\nione plaintiffs. And though a declaration of unitary status would\nobviously represent a defeat for the legal position that CMS has taken\nin this litigation, such a defeat would not be tantamount to being \"pre-\nvailed against\" under § 1988. Rather, the primary significance of a\ndeclaration of unitary status would be that CMS has succeeded in\neradicating the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practica-\nble and, as the Capacchione plaintiffs put it, in obtaining a \"return to\nlocal control.\" Brief of Appellees at 34. The Board, upon a declara-\ntion of unitariness, would actually have wider latitude to assign stu-\ndents as it sees fit than it did while it was under court order to remedy\npast discrimination (although certain race-conscious policies might no\nlonger be permissible). We are unable to see how a broadening of the\nBoard's discretion can be viewed as a \"material alteration of the legal\nrelationship\" between CMS and the Capacchione plaintiffs.\n\nWe note that the predominant pattern in the desegregation cases\nhas been to award attorney's fees to the original prevailing plaintiffs\n-- even for legal work related to the unsuccessful defense of a deseg-\nregation decree against a motion to modify or dissolve. See, e.g., Jen-\nkins v. Missouri, 127 F.3d 709, 714 (8th Cir. 1997) (en banc) (\"[The\nJenkins class has enjoyed the benefits of prevailing in this litigation\nfor more than a decade. Jenkins III did not void the many remedial\norders issued in this case that have never been reversed during the\nprocess of a direct appeal.\"). Properly understood, a declaration of\nunitary status represents the last stage in the process of desegregation,\n\n                  70\n\fand the school board's success in reaching that last stage is often\nappropriately credited to the original plaintiffs who brought the case.27\n                                                                       27\n\nVII.\n\nFinally, CMS appeals the district court's order awarding sanctions\n-- including legal fees and costs -- to the Capacchione plaintiffs\narising from a discovery dispute. In the months before trial, CMS did\nnot respond to interrogatories by the Capacchione plaintiffs seeking\ndisclosure of fact witnesses. Instead, the Board waited until the week\nbefore trial to reveal the names of most of its fact witnesses, provid-\ning the Capacchione plaintiffs with a list of 174 names which it ulti-\nmately narrowed to twenty-six potential witnesses. The Board\nmaintains that its actions complied with the district court's pretrial\norder, which required the parties to provide a list of fact witnesses to\neach other \"[n]o later than the morning of the first day of trial.\" J.A.\n150.\n\nThe district court, however, granted the Capacchione plaintiffs'\nmotion for sanctions. The court held that it had established the rules\nfor disclosure of fact witnesses in an order of September 1998, which\nsuperseded the pretrial order. The September 1998 order denied the\nCapacchione plaintiffs' motion to compel disclosure of witnesses\nprior to the date established in the pretrial order for disclosure of\nexpert witnesses, but the court stated that \"CMS must supplement its\nresponses, as it promised, when such information becomes known.\"\nJ.A. 195. In awarding sanctions, the district court also indicated its\nconcern that CMS had been \"lacking candor in disclosing relevant\nand important information\" during the pretrial stage, that the disclo-\nsure of a list of 174 potential witnesses in the week before trial was\n\"extremely prejudicial to opposing counsel,\" and that many of the\nwitnesses on the list may have been \"irrelevant or unnecessarily\ncumulative.\" J.A. 305. As a result, the district court ordered a one-\nweek recess after the Capacchione plaintiffs' presentation at trial to\nallow them to depose, at the school system's expense, any of the\ntwenty-six witnesses on the Board's revised list. Witnesses whom the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n27 We leave it for the parties to argue, and the district court to decide\nin the first instance, whether any party may be entitled to an award of\nattorney's fees based on the outcome of proceedings on remand.\n\n                  71\n\fBoard did not make available for deposition or interview during the\nmid-trial recess were barred from testifying.\n\n\"Rule 37(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure gives the dis-\ntrict court wide discretion to impose sanctions for a party's failure to\ncomply with its discovery orders.\" Mutual Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v.\nRichards & Ass'ns., Inc., 872 F.2d 88, 92 (4th Cir. 1989). CMS could\nplausibly have understood the deadline for disclosure of fact wit-\nnesses contained in the pretrial order to have continued in effect after\nthe subsequent September 1998 order given that the subsequent\norder's central effect was to reaffirm the deadline contained in the\npretrial order for disclosure of expert witnesses. Nonetheless, we can-\nnot say that the district court abused its broad discretion in finding\nthat its September 1998 order did in fact supersede the pretrial order,\nand that the Board's pretrial conduct had been unnecessarily dilatory\nand prejudicial to the Capacchione plaintiffs. We therefore affirm the\norder of sanctions against CMS.\n\nVIII.\n\nFor more than a hundred years, in fits and starts, our nation has\nattempted to undo the effects of its shameful heritage of slavery. For\nnearly fifty years, federal courts have struggled with the task of dis-\nmantling legally enforced racial segregation in many of our schools.\nThis task has given rise to one of the preeminent issues of constitu-\ntional law in our time. We do not yet know how history will regard\nthe courts' role in adjudicating and presiding over the desegregation\nof schools. It may be seen as a brief and unfortunate jurisprudential\nanomaly, justified only by the immediacy of the evil it was intended\nto uproot, cf. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 505-07 (Scalia, J., concurring); or\nit may be recognized as the necessarily sustained effort to eradicate\ndeep-seated vestiges of racial discrimination and to vindicate the\npromise of the Fourteenth Amendment, cf. Dowell, 498 U.S. at 266-\n68 (Marshall, J., dissenting); or it may be viewed in some other way\nthat we cannot now anticipate. Our decision today does not attempt\nan answer.\n\nBut we are certain that the end of this great task must be accom-\nplished in an orderly manner, consistent with and true to its origin.\nWe are certain, too, that if the courts, at some point, come to view the\n\n                  72\n\feffort to eliminate the vestiges of segregation as having been overly\n\"race-conscious,\" they must do so with a clear assessment of the his-\ntorical record.\n\nRace neutrality, of course, represents one of our constitutional ide-\nals. Properly understood, it is an ideal not at all in tension with our\nobligation as a society to undo the effects of slavery and of the racial\ncaste system that was perpetuated, for more than a century, in slav-\nery's wake. But we must be ever mindful, as we strive for race neu-\ntrality, that a reductive and willfully ahistorical conception of race\nneutrality was, in an earlier era, used as a blunt instrument against the\naspirations of African-Americans merely seeking to claim entitlement\nto full citizenship.\n\nIn striking down early civil rights legislation, the Supreme Court\nembraced this misconceived race neutrality, reasoning, only twenty\nyears after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, that the\nlegislation at issue would illegitimately make black citizens \"the spe-\ncial favorite of the laws.\" Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 25 (1883).\nIndeed, the system of segregation with which we are concerned was\njustified at its inception by a particular conception of race neutrality\n-- that a regime of racial separation could be constitutionally justified\nso long as it applied neutrally and equally to persons of all races. See\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 551 (1896) (\"We consider the\nunderlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the\nassumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the\ncolored race with a badge of inferiority.\").\n\nThe first Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy, declared our Consti-\ntution to be \"color-blind,\" id., 163 U.S. at 559, and in doing so pro-\nvided one of the most famous and compelling articulations of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equality. But in urging us to be \"blind\" to\nrace, Justice Harlan did not, as is sometimes suggested, suggest that\nwe be ignorant of it. In Plessy, he was the only member of the Court\nwilling to acknowledge the most obvious truth about segregation:\n\"Everyone knows that the statute in question had its origin in the pur-\npose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occu-\npied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied\nor assigned to white persons.\" Id. at 557. Thirteen years earlier, dis-\nsenting in the Civil Rights Cases, Justice Harlan rejected the notion\n\n                  73\n\fthat civil rights legislation made blacks a \"special favorite of the\nlaws,\" id., 109 U.S. at 61, and he criticized the majority's reasoning\nas \"narrow and artificial.\" Id. at 26.\n\nWe recognize now, as Justice Harlan recognized then, that no sim-\nple syllogism can enfold all of history's burdens and complexities.\nEliminating race-consciousness from government decisionmaking\nmust be regarded as among our worthiest constitutional aspirations.\nBut that aspiration surely cannot be so rigid that it refuses to distin-\nguish the \"race consciousness\" that created a segregated school sys-\ntem and the race-conscious efforts necessary to eliminate that system.\nWhile most judges are not historians, we must be willing to acknowl-\nedge and confront our history. If we fail to do so, we risk falling into\na mode that equates the cure with the disease: civil rights with favorit-\nism, desegregation with segregation. As American citizens, we know\nbetter.\n\nWe must and do sympathize with those who are impatient with\ncontinued federal court involvement in the operation of local schools.\nThirty-five years could be considered a long time for a school district\nto operate under judicial desegregation decrees. However, when the\nSupreme Court decided Swann in 1971 no one could reasonably have\nthought that the substantial task described there would be quickly or\neasily accomplished. CMS, which maintained a separate, decidedly\nunequal dual educational system for decades -- and which mightily\nresisted desegregation of any sort for years after it became the law of\nthe land -- has come a long way. While CMS has now achieved uni-\ntary status in certain respects, this record simply does not support a\ndetermination that the process of desegregation is at an end. Nor does\nit support a holding that CMS violated the Constitution when, pursu-\nant to court orders, it undertook judicially approved action to remedy\nits own long history of racial segregation.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate\nin certain respects, and remand this case to the district court for fur-\nther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\nVACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\n                   74\n\fTRAXLER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\nFifty years ago a number of school boards ran schools with intent\nto divide the races. Black children went to predominantly black\nschools and were taught by black teachers. White children were\ntaught by white teachers in white schools. Equal resources and oppor-\ntunities were denied African-American children. In 1954 the Supreme\nCourt declared these practices to be violative of the constitutional\nrights of black children to equal protection of the laws. Federal courts\nwere directed to oversee the dismantling of segregated school sys-\ntems, Charlotte-Mecklenburg's included. When the old system was\nended and a constitutional system was in place, the federal courts\nwere to get out of the education business and to return the schools to\nthe control of the people elected to run them.\n\nThe district court began its oversight of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nschool system in 1965 and over the next few years worked with the\nschool system to develop a plan that would bring the school district\ninto compliance with the law. By 1975 the court concluded that the\ndesegregation plan in place then would work and that the case could\nbe closed as an active matter.\n\nSince that time two generations of students have passed through\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg's schools and, until the present case, not one\nperson has been back to court alleging that past segregative practices\nhave been continued. That is because the former system has been\neliminated to the extent practicable.\n\nYet now, when an effort is made to end federal court control, the\nschool board resists. The board would have the public and this court\nbelieve that for the last twenty years it has operated a school system\nwhich has continued to discriminate against African-American\nschoolchildren in disregard of both reason and the district court's\norder. If this is true, the people of Mecklenburg County should be out-\nraged. But, of course, it is not true. The district court found it not to\nbe true and it reached that conclusion for solid reasons.\n\nBecause I believe the facts show Charlotte-Mecklenburg has been\nsuccessful in its efforts to eliminate the segregative practices of the\npast, I cannot agree with a ruling that will keep the school district\n\n                  75\n\funder the yoke of federal court control. Mecklenburg County's posi-\ntion as a progressive metropolitan area is fact and not facade, and the\ntime has come to return the school system to it. Therefore, I dissent\nfrom a holding that would do otherwise.\n\nI further would find unconstitutional a policy that would deny a\nchild an open seat in a magnet school because of the color of the\nchild's skin. For that reason I also dissent from a holding that would\nreverse the district judge and permit such a practice.\n\nI.\n\nIn 1896, the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana statute \"providing\nfor separate railway carriages for the white and colored races.\" Plessy\nv. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 540 (1896). The Plessy majority charac-\nterized the statute as \"not necessarily imply[ing] the inferiority of\neither race,\" id. at 544, but the first Justice Harlan, in dissent, aptly\ndescribed the true aim of the law: \"Everyone knows that the statute\nin question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white\npersons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored\npeople from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons.\" Id.\nat 557 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan further \"den[ied] that\nany legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race\nof citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved.\" Id. at\n554-55 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Unfortunately, the principle of \"sepa-\nrate but equal\" reached much farther than Louisiana railways, and was\napplied to other public services, including education. The march of\nprogress eventually proved the correctness of Justice Harlan's princi-\npled stand. Segregation, in all of its manifestations, was \"arbitrary\"\nand \"wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality\nbefore the law established by the Constitution.\" Id. at 561-62 (Harlan,\nJ., dissenting).\n\nEarly efforts aimed at combating the injustice wrought by Plessy\nin educational settings often centered on state-funded graduate and\nprofessional schools. See, e.g., Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada,\n305 U.S. 337 (1938); see generally Mark V. Tushnet, The NAACP's\nLegal Strategy Against Segregated Education 1925-1950 (1987). In\nGaines, an African-American student was denied admission to the\nUniversity of Missouri School of Law on account of his race. Mis-\n\n                  76\n\fsouri had no \"separate but equal\" law school for its African-American\ncitizens and instead offered to pay Gaines' tuition and expenses for\na legal education in another state. The Supreme Court held that Mis-\nsouri's offer denied Gaines equal protection of the laws. The Court\nobserved that \"[t]he admissibility of laws separating the races in the\nenjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the\nequality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups\nwithin the State.\" Gaines, 305 U.S. at 349. Though providing only\nsmall victories, cases like Gaines exposed \"separate but equal\" for the\nuntenable proposition that it was.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court recognized the futility of measuring\nequality in segregated facilities. See Brown v. Board of Educ., 347\nU.S. 483 (1954) (Brown I). Presented with a direct attack on Plessy\nin a secondary education case, the Court held that \"segregation of\nchildren in public schools solely on the basis of race\" violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 493.\nThe Court emphasized that an educational \"opportunity, where a state\nhas undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available\nto all on equal terms.\" Id. Recognizing that segregation differed from\nlocality to locality, the Supreme Court subsequently declined to craft\na broad, one-size-fits-all remedy, and instead instructed the federal\ndistrict courts to oversee the implementation of appropriate relief\nbased on the dictates of local circumstances. See Brown v. Board of\nEduc., 349 U.S. 294, 299 (1955) (Brown II ) (\"Because of their prox-\nimity to local conditions and the possible need for further hearings,\nthe courts which originally heard these cases can best perform th[e]\njudicial appraisal.\"). The district courts were directed to make use of\nthe \"traditional attributes of equity power,\" id. at 300, to ensure that\nstudents were \"admit[ted] to public schools on a racially nondiscrimi-\nnatory basis,\" id. at 301. However, under the Brown opinions it was\nunclear whether a school district was required to take affirmative\nsteps to remedy the constitutional violation, see, e.g., Briggs v. Elliott,\n132 F. Supp. 776, 777 (E.D.S.C. 1955) (holding that Brown merely\nprohibited school districts from using the force of law to separate the\nraces), and very little progress resulted.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court provided further guidance to the lower\nfederal courts, the original Swann plaintiffs in 1965 challenged as\nconstitutionally inadequate the efforts of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\n\n                   77\n\fSchools (\"CMS\") in complying with Brown. The school district's\ndesegregation plan was based on freedom of choice whereby \"any\nchild, without regard to race, and without regard to minority or major-\nity of race in any particular school, might freely transfer to another\nschool of his choice.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n243 F. Supp. 667, 668 (W.D.N.C. 1965). The district court approved\nthe plan, observing that more could be done \"to increase mixing of\nthe races,\" but that the law imposed \"no such duty upon . . . the\nSchool Board.\" Id. at 670.\n\nConcerned at the slow pace of school desegregation throughout the\nnation, the Supreme Court held in 1968 that school boards had an \"af-\nfirmative duty\" to end the state-imposed dual system of education.\nGreen v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437 (1968). The Justices\nunderscored that \"in desegregating a dual system a plan utilizing\n`freedom of choice' is not an end in itself.\" Id. at 440. The Swann\nplaintiffs then filed in the district court a motion for further relief\n\"seek[ing] greater speed in desegregation of the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg schools, and request[ing] elimination of certain other\nalleged racial inequalities.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 300 F. Supp. 1358, 1360 (W.D.N.C. 1969). The district court,\nguided by the mandate of Green, see Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1362,\nmade a number of factual findings and concluded that the school dis-\ntrict remained highly segregated.\n\nThe district court noted that over half of CMS's 24,000 black stu-\ndents \"attend schools that are all black, or very nearly all black, and\nmost of the 24,000 have no white teachers.\" Id. at 1360. However, the\ncourt found no violations \"in the use of federal funds; the use of\nmobile classrooms; quality of school buildings and facilities; athlet-\nics; PTA activities; school fees; free lunches; books; elective courses;\nnor in individual evaluation of students.\" Id. at 1372.\n\nThe district court directed CMS to submit \"a positive plan for fac-\nulty desegregation effective in the fall of 1969, and a plan for effec-\ntive desegregation of pupil population, to be predominantly effective\nin the fall of 1969 and to be completed by the fall of 1970.\" Id. at\n1360. The board procrastinated, but eventually submitted an ener-\nvated desegregation plan that the district court approved \"with great\nreluctance\" on a temporary basis. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg\n\n                  78\n\fBd. of Educ., 306 F. Supp. 1291, 1298 (W.D.N.C. 1969). CMS offi-\ncials, however, continued to drag their feet, and the district court was\nforced to appoint its own expert, Dr. John A. Finger, to craft an effi-\ncacious desegregation plan. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., 311 F. Supp. 265 (W.D.N.C. 1970). Dr. Finger's plan,\nadopted by the district court, included limited use of mathematical\nratios, pairing and grouping of school zones, and busing. See id. We\naffirmed a portion of the plan, but vacated provisions dealing with the\nbusing of elementary school students because of the perceived bur-\ndens on small children and the cost of purchasing new buses. See\nSwann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 431 F.2d 138, 147\n(4th. Cir. 1970) (en banc). We remanded \"for reconsideration of the\nassignment of pupils in the elementary schools.\" Id. The Supreme\nCourt granted certiorari and reinstated the district court's plan pend-\ning further proceedings. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 399 U.S. 926 (1970). The district court conducted eight days\nof hearings and examined five different desegregation plans. The dis-\ntrict court concluded the Finger plan to be the best of the five, encom-\npassing \"a reasonable . . . collection of methods for solving the\nproblem\" of the dual system. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 318 F. Supp. 786, 800 (W.D.N.C. 1970). As for busing and the\ncost of new buses, the district court found that the Finger plan took\n\"proper advantage of traffic movement\" and that new buses would\ncost only $660,000, a far cry from the millions of dollars that CMS\nhad originally estimated. See id. at 797-98. Two months later, the\nSupreme Court granted certiorari and undertook an in-depth review\nof the power of the federal district courts to craft such sweeping\ndesegregation remedies. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., 402 U.S. 1 (1971).\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the desegregation plan adopted by the\ndistrict court, and in the course of its opinion identified and offered\nguidance in \"four problem areas.\" Id. at 22. First, the Court addressed\nthe issue of the district court's use of racial ratios. While the Supreme\nCourt approved of a limited use of mathematical ratios in a plan\ncrafted by a district court, it emphasized that such ratios were \"a start-\ning point . . . rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25. The\nCourt reminded district courts that \"[t]he constitutional command to\ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every commu-\nnity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system\n\n                  79\n\fas a whole.\" Id. at 24. Second, the Court dealt with single-race\nschools. Though the Court concluded that schools consisting of pre-\ndominantly one race were not per se unconstitutional, the Court\ninstructed the district courts to utilize \"close scrutiny to determine that\nschool assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.\" Id. at\n26. Third, the Court considered alterations of attendance zones. The\nCourt held \"that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school\nzones is a permissible tool,\" id. at 28, but declined to craft \"rigid\nrules\" in light of differing local circumstances, id. at 29. Finally, the\nCourt tackled the busing issue. The Court confirmed that a district\ncourt could order \"bus transportation as one tool of school desegrega-\ntion,\" but within reasonable time and distance restrictions. Id. at 30.\n\nShortly after the Supreme Court issued its landmark Swann opin-\nion, CMS asked the district court to abandon the Finger plan and per-\nmit the substitution of a \"feeder plan\" whereby schools would draw\npupils from designated attendance areas in an effort to keep children\ntogether for their entire public school career. See Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 328 F. Supp. 1346 (W.D.N.C. 1971). Cit-\ning concerns of resegregation and the placement of additional burdens\non African-American children, the district court questioned the feeder\nplan. See id. at 1350-53. CMS then withdrew its original feeder plan\nand began work on a modified version. See id. at 1353. The district\ncourt eventually approved a revised feeder plan that reopened several\nformer black schools and prevented over- and under-utilization of\nfacilities. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 334 F.\nSupp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1971).\n\nHowever, within just two years it became clear that CMS's revised\nfeeder plan was inadequate \"for dealing with foreseeable problems\"\nin the dismantling of the dual system. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 362 F. Supp. 1223, 1229 (W.D.N.C.\n1973). The district court found \"that various formerly black schools\nand other schools will turn black under the feeder plan,\" id., and that\n\"[r]acial discrimination through official action has not ended in this\nschool system,\" id. at 1230. The district court again instructed CMS\nto design a new pupil assignment plan \"on the premise that equal pro-\ntection of laws is here to stay.\" Id. at 1238.\n\nIn 1974 CMS adopted and the district court approved new guide-\nlines and policies for pupil assignment. See Swann v. Charlotte-\n\n                  80\n\fMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 379 F. Supp. 1102 (W.D.N.C. 1974). The\nplan was designed by a citizens advisory group working with the\nboard in an effort to reach \"an acceptable consensus\" on school deseg-\nregation in CMS. Id. at 1103. The plan's most promising features\nwere the avoidance of any majority black schools (with the exception\nof Hidden Valley, an exempted school), and a more equal distribution\nof the busing burden. See id. at 1105-1110. Praising the board for\nmaking \"a clean break with the essentially `reluctant' attitude which\ndominated Board actions for many years,\" the district court predicted\nthat the policies and positive attitude would eventually result in a uni-\ntary school system. Id. at 1103.\n\nThe district court closed Swann in 1975 and removed the case from\nthe active docket. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n67 F.R.D. 648 (W.D.N.C. 1975). In so doing, the district court\nobserved that the board was \"actively and intelligently addressing\"\nrecurrent problems related to dismantlement of the dual system. Id. at\n649. Until the case at bar, the Swann plaintiffs have never attempted\nto reopen the case in order to address any alleged failure by the board\nto comply with the district court's desegregation orders.\n\nThe present litigation arose in September 1997 when William\nCapacchione (\"Capacchione\") filed suit against CMS on behalf of his\ndaughter, Christina, alleging that she had been unconstitutionally\ndenied admission to a magnet school program on account of her race.\nIn 1992, without prior court approval, CMS had adopted a desegrega-\ntion plan focused mainly on the use of magnet schools. In filling mag-\nnet schools, CMS had instituted a black and a non-black lottery to\nachieve racial balance. If a sufficient number of blacks or whites did\nnot apply and fill the seats allotted to their respective races, then CMS\nwould actively recruit children of the desired race despite lengthy\nwaiting lists made up of children of the other race. If the recruitment\ndrive failed, CMS usually left the available slots vacant. Christina,\nwho is white, was placed on a waiting list and eventually denied\nadmission to a program at the Olde Providence magnet school.\n\nThe original Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann and to\nconsolidate it with Capacchione's suit. They asserted that the vestiges\nof the dual school system had not been abolished and that the use of\nrace in the magnet admissions policy was necessary for the school\n\n                  81\n\fdistrict to comply with the prior desegregation orders. The district\ncourt granted the motion and later permitted Capacchione to intervene\nin the Swann litigation. Seeking a finding that CMS had eradicated\nthe vestiges of past discrimination, another group of parents, led by\nMichael P. Grant (\"Grant\"),1\n                           1 was also permitted to intervene in the lit-\nigation.\n\nAfter a two-month bench trial, the district court determined that\nCMS had achieved unitary status, that the race-based admissions pol-\nicy for CMS's magnet schools fell outside prior orders and was not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest, and that an\ninjunction was warranted. The district court \"enjoin[ed] CMS from\nany further use of race-based lotteries, preferences, and set-asides in\nstudent assignment.\" Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., 57\nF. Supp. 2d 228, 292 (W.D.N.C. 1999). Citing interests in stability,\nthe district court concluded that the injunction would not affect stu-\ndent assignments for the 1999-2000 school year, but would apply to\nstudent assignments for the 2000-2001 school year. See id. at 292\nn.52. CMS and the Swann plaintiffs filed notices of appeal, and CMS\nmoved to stay the injunction, except as applied to the magnet schools,\nuntil the 2001-02 school year. The Swann plaintiffs moved for a com-\nplete stay pending appeal. On November 15, 1999, the district court\ndenied the motions. CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, pursuant to Fed-\neral Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(2), moved this court for a stay.\nOn December 30, 1999, we stayed the district court's injunction pend-\ning further order of this court.\n\nII. Unitary Status\n\nThe district court's unitary status finding is reviewed for clear\nerror. See Riddick v. School Bd., 784 F.2d 521, 533 (4th Cir. 1986);\nFed. R. Civ. P. 52(a). \"A finding is clearly erroneous when, although\nthere is evidence to support it, on the entire evidence the reviewing\ncourt is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\nbeen committed.\" Faulconer v. Commissioner, 748 F.2d 890, 895 (4th\nCir. 1984). In clarifying the clearly erroneous standard, the Supreme\nCourt has explained:\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1 Those represented by Capacchione and Grant will be referred to as the\n\"plaintiff-intervenors.\"\n\n                     82\n\f        If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in\n        light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals\n        may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been\n        sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evi-\n        dence differently. Where there are two permissible views of\n        the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot\n        be clearly erroneous.\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985). The\nSupreme Court also stressed that even when appellate review is based\nprimarily on documentary evidence, the clearly erroneous standard of\nreview remains the same. See id. at 574. So long as the district court's\nunitary status determination rests on a permissible view of the evi-\ndence, it must be affirmed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has declined to define or provide a \"fixed\nmeaning\" for the term \"unitary.\" Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 487\n(1992). However, in light of the aim of Brown I, which was \"the elim-\nination of state-mandated or deliberately maintained dual school sys-\ntems,\" Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 737 (1974) (Milliken I), a\nschool system must be declared unitary when it no longer discrimi-\nnates between children on the basis of race, see Green, 391 U.S. at\n442. The burden of proof falls on the party seeking an end to court\nsupervision. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494.\n\nIn undertaking a unitary status inquiry, a court must ask \"whether\nthe Board ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\nsince it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination\nha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Board of Educ. v.\nDowell, 498 U.S. 237, 249-50 (1991). Implicit in the Supreme Court's\nuse of the term \"practicable\" is \"a reasonable limit on the duration of\n. . . federal supervision.\" Coalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd.\nof Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 760 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 247 (\"From the very first, federal supervision of local school sys-\ntems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimina-\ntion.\"). Hence, the goals of a desegregation order not only encompass\na remedy for the violation, but also prompt restoration of local con-\ntrol. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490 (\"Returning schools to the control\nof local authorities at the earliest practicable date is essential to\nrestore their true accountability in our governmental system. . . .\n\n                  83\n\fWhere control lies, so too does responsibility.\"); Milliken I, 418 U.S.\nat 741-42 (\"No single tradition in public education is more deeply\nrooted than local control over the operation of schools; local auton-\nomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of com-\nmunity concern and support for public schools and to quality of the\neducational process.\").\n\nAmong the most important reference points in determining whether\na school board has fulfilled its duties so that local control may be\nresumed are the factors set out in Green: student assignment, faculty\nassignment, facilities and resources, transportation, staff assignment,\nand extracurricular activities. See Green, 391 U.S. at 435. In its dis-\ncretion, a court conducting a unitary status hearing may consider\nother relevant factors not mentioned in Green. See Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 492. I address the district court's consideration of each factor in\nturn, but only to determine whether \"the district court's account of the\nevidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\"\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74.\n\nA. Student Assignment\n\nStudent assignment is perhaps the most critical Green factor\nbecause state-mandated separation of pupils on the basis of race is the\nessence of the dual system. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474 (observing\nthat the issue of student assignment is \"fundamental\" because \"under\nthe former de jure regimes racial exclusion was both the means and\nthe end of a policy motivated by disparagement of . . . the disfavored\nrace\"). To determine whether a school was racially balanced or imbal-\nanced, the district court adopted a plus/minus fifteen percent variance\nfrom the district-wide ratio of black to white students. See Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 246. However, the district court emphasized\n\"that there is no level of compliance with the standard that is determi-\nnative.\" Id. When schools are outside the variance, a \"reasonable and\nsupportable explanation[ ]\" will suffice. Id.\n\nThe plus/minus fifteen percent variance adopted by the district\ncourt was not clearly erroneous. Considering that the only variance\never approved by the district court in the course of the Swann litiga-\ntion was a \"`plus 15%' from the district-wide average,\" id. at 245, the\naddition of a minus fifteen percent is reasonable. Moreover, the\n\n                  84\n\fSupreme Court has permitted a \"limited use . . . of mathematical\nratios\" by district courts, Swann, 402 U.S. at 25, and much higher\nvariances have been used to define desegregation. See Adams v. Wein-\nberger, 391 F. Supp. 269, 271 (D.D.C. 1975) (using a plus/minus\ntwenty percent variance); see generally, David J. Armor, Forced Jus-\ntice: School Desegregation and the Law 160 (1995) (observing that\nin over seventy percent of the school districts with desegregation\nplans where racial balance is measured by numerical standards, a\nvariance of plus/minus fifteen percent or greater is used).2 2 In sum, the\nplus/minus fifteen percent variance is clearly within accepted stan-\ndards, and provides a reasonable starting point in the unitary status\ndetermination.\n\n1. CMS's Compliance Record\n\nThe district court began by observing that since 1970, of the 126\nschools in operation, \"only twenty schools (16%) have had black stu-\ndent bodies higher than 15% above the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years, and only seventeen schools (13%) have had black\nstudent bodies lower than 15% below the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 248 (footnote omit-\nted). In addition, the district court found that CMS has not operated\na single-race school since 1970. See id.\n\nThe district court also turned to two desegregation indices: the dis-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 At trial, Dr. Eric Smith, the current superintendent of CMS, testified\nthat unitary status depended on every school being in balance. See J.A.\nXV-7187 & 7239. This is not the law. See Swann , 402 U.S. at 24 (\"The\nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of\nthe school system as a whole.\").\n\nI find equally erroneous the Swann plaintiffs' assertion at appellate\nargument that \"[t]he issue of how many schools are balanced has never\nbeen a question in this case.\" App. Tr. 91. The racial composition of\nschools goes to the heart of a desegregation case, and is very much key\nto a review of the district court's declaration of unitary status. See\nSwann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (ordering CMS to assign pupils \"in such a\nway that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various grade\nlevels have about the same proportion of black and white students\").\n\n                   85\n\fsimilarity index and the index of interracial exposure. The former\n\"measures the degree of racial imbalance, and it is derived by com-\nparing the racial composition of each school to the districtwide com-\nposition,\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172, and the latter measures the \"the\naverage percent white in schools attended by black students, weighted\nby the proportion of black students in each school.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,172. According to the report of the plaintiff-intervenors' expert\nwitness, Dr. David J. Armor, a dissimilarity value of twenty or below\nsignifies \"a highly balanced school system\" and a score under thirty\nsignifies \"a substantially desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172.\nCMS's dissimilarity score was sixteen in 1980 and twenty-six in\n1995. From this it is clear that CMS quickly desegregated in the\n1970s and continues to maintain a \"substantially desegregated sys-\ntem.\" The dissimilarity index also indicates that CMS has better racial\nbalance than several comparable districts did when they were\ndeclared unitary. See J.A. XXXIII-16,173.\n\nThe index of interracial exposure, like the dissimilarity index,\nshows that CMS has made great leaps of progress. A score of zero on\nthe exposure index signifies total segregation, while a score of fifty\nor above indicates a \"highly desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,172. Schools in CMS typically score above fifty, whereas before\nthe desegregation order the schools' scores hovered near twenty or\nbelow. See J.A. XXXIII-16,194-96.\n\nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs correctly point out that the data sug-\ngest that in recent years racial imbalance has increased in some\nschools. Aware of this trend, the district court made a number of find-\nings on growth and demographic change in the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg area. The most revealing findings are as follows:\n\n       - the county population has increased from 354,656 in\n       1970 to 613,310 in 1997\n\n       - in 1970 the school district was the forty-third largest in\n       the nation and is today the twenty-third largest\n\n       - Among cities with more than 500,000 people, Charlotte\n       ranks second in population growth in the 1990s\n\n                  86\n\f       - the racial composition of the county has changed from\n       seventy-six percent white and twenty-four percent black\n       in 1970 to sixty-eight percent white, twenty-seven per-\n       cent black, and five percent other in 1997\n\n       - the current racial composition of schoolchildren is fifty\n       percent white, forty-two percent black, and eight percent\n       other\n\n       - as the county has become more suburban the inner city\n       and nearby suburbs have lost large numbers of white res-\n       idents as they spread farther out into the formerly rural\n       sections of the county\n\n       - some middle suburban communities that were once all\n       white are now predominately black\n\n       - the rural black population in the southern part of the\n       county has remained relatively constant while the white\n       population has tripled because of suburbanization\n\nSee Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 236-39. These finding are sup-\nported by the report of the plaintiff-intervenors' expert in demograph-\nics, Dr. William Clark. See J.A. XXXIII-16230-306. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here can be no doubt that demography\nand geography have played the largest role in causing imbalance.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250.\n\nTestimony from Dr. John Murphy, CMS's superintendent from\n1991 to 1995, corroborates the district court's conclusion. Dr. Murphy\ntestified that when he assumed his duties he \"was quite concerned\nabout the increasing difficulty in bringing about racial balance . . .\nbecause of the demographic shifts that were occurring.\" J.A. VI-2712.\nPopulation growth translated into more automobiles on the road, mak-\ning increased busing impracticable because \"the travel time to move\nyoungsters from the suburbs into the city with the flow of rush hour\ntraffic was a problem.\" J.A. VI-2732. In the fall of 1991, CMS hired\nDr. Michael J. Stolee to examine the problem and offer solutions. Dr.\nStolee also concluded that CMS's task \"has been complicated by pop-\n\n                  87\n\fulation growth,\" J.A. XXXII-15,571, and he recommended the adop-\ntion of a magnet schools program, which CMS promptly\nimplemented.\n\nThe Supreme Court has dealt with similar population growth and\nshifting demographics in the context of unitary status. In Freeman,\nthe court unequivocally stated that \"racial imbalance . . . [is] not tanta-\nmount to a showing that the school district [is] in noncompliance with\nthe decree or with its duties under the law.\" 503 U.S. at 494. Brown\nI, of course, does not mandate that racial balance be pursued in perpe-\ntuity. Once the original racial imbalance caused by a constitutional\nviolation has been rectified, \"the school district is under no duty to\nremedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.\" Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 494. The Swann plaintiffs contend that consideration of\ndemographics and the rationale of Freeman are misplaced because the\ngrowth and shifting demographics of DeKalb County, Georgia, the\nschool district under court order in Freeman, exceeded that of\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg. While CMS's growth rates and demographic\nshifts certainly do not equal those experienced in DeKalb,3  3 I can find\nnothing in Freeman limiting its holding to the specific facts of\nDeKalb County or establishing DeKalb as the standard for measuring\nimbalance caused by demographic factors. On the contrary, the opin-\nion speaks in general terms. The Supreme Court observed that in the\nUnited States \"it is inevitable that the demographic makeup of school\ndistricts, based as they are on political subdivisions such as counties\nand municipalities, may undergo rapid change.\" Id. at 495. Mobility,\nthe Court noted, \"is a distinct characteristic of our society.\" Id. at 494.\nFreeman cannot be distinguished into nothingness, nor does the stan-\ndard of review permit this court to reweigh the evidence of the\nchanges in CMS.\n\nSimply put, the district court's conclusion that the current imbal-\nance is unrelated to the original constitutional violation is not clearly\nerroneous. Evidence presented at trial indicated that \"[o]f the 16 for-\nmer black schools that are still open, 13 are currently balanced and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 For example, the population of DeKalb County grew from 70,000 in\n1950 to 450,000 in 1985, and the percentage of black students in the dis-\ntrict grew from 5.6 percent in 1969 to forty-seven percent in 1986. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 475.\n\n                   88\n\fhave been desegregated for periods ranging from 22 to 28 years. Of\nthe 3 that currently exceed the +15% black variance, each has been\nbalanced for at least 22 years.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Interestingly, of\nthe seventy-two former white schools that are still open, fifteen are\nnow majority black and were in balance for periods of twelve to\ntwenty-five years. See J.A. XXXIII-16,176.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Armor examined the seventeen schools in CMS\nthat exceeded the plus fifteen percent variance for three or more years\nduring the last decade. See J.A. XXXIII-16,174-76.4\n                                                  4 Sixteen of the\nseventeen were balanced for periods ranging from nineteen to twenty-\nsix years, with one school experiencing balance for sixteen years. To\nthe extent that CMS's pupil reassignments could be assessed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that changes instituted by CMS were \"attempts to\nmaintain or restore racial balance in the face of overwhelming demo-\ngraphic growth and mobility.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Indeed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that imbalance had been reduced in several of the\nschools because CMS's magnet program attracted white students\nfrom the outer reaches of the county.\n\nLong periods of almost perfect compliance with the court's racial\nbalance guidelines,5\n                   5 coupled with some imbalance in the wake of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 Dr. Armor did not include the predominantly white schools in this\nanalysis on three grounds:\n\n        (1) the court order did not establish a minimum percent black\n        enrollment, (2) the half-dozen schools that have had low black\n        enrollment for the past three or more years and that were operat-\n        ing in 1972 have been racially balanced for at least ten years[,]\n        and (3) the demographic analysis of Dr. Clark shows that these\n        schools have become imbalanced or were opened imbalanced\n        because of the substantial white enrollment growth in the out-\n        skirts of the county.\n\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,174 (footnote omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 26\n(observing \"that the existence of some small number of one-race, or vir-\ntually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark\nof a system that still practices segregation by law\").\n\n5 Even the Swann plaintiffs admit that ten years after the district court\ncharged the board with taking affirmative steps to desegregate schools,\nthe system \"w[as] nearly 100% statistically compliant with the court's\norders.\" Plaintiff-Appellants' Brief at 38.\n\n                   89\n\fmassive demographic shifts, strongly supports the district court's\nfinding that the present levels of imbalance are in no way connected\nwith the de jure segregation once practiced in CMS. See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 495 (\"Where resegregation is a product not of state action\nbut of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications.\").\nThe evidence presented at trial adequately explained why a few\nschools have become imbalanced, and I can discern no evidence or\nomissions that indicate clear error has been committed in this regard.\n\n                   90\n\fVolume 3 of 3\n\n                91\n\f2. Martin and Unitary Status\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs also point to school sitings, transportation\nburdens, and school transfers as evidence that the growing imbalance\nis caused by state action rather than private choices, and that CMS has\nnot complied with the district court's orders in good faith. In advanc-\ning their argument, the Swann plaintiffs rely chiefly on Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 475 F. Supp. 1318\n(W.D.N.C. 1979), in which a group of parents sought to enjoin CMS\nfrom reassigning over 4000 students in order to maintain racial bal-\nance in certain schools. The plaintiffs in Martin based their position\non Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424\n(1976), and Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n265 (1978). In the former case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that\ndistrict courts could not order a school district \"to rearrange its atten-\ndance zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by\nthe court was maintained in perpetuity,\" Spangler, 427 U.S. at 436,\nand in the latter the Court struck down a medical school admissions\npolicy that reserved sixteen of one hundred seats in the entering class\nfor applicants who were \"`economically and/or educationally disad-\nvantaged'\" and who were members of certain minority groups. Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 274. The district court in Martin distinguished Spangler\nby observing that it was but a restatement of the Swann Court's admo-\nnition about the use of racial quotas and that, unlike Pasadena City,\nCMS had not achieved racially neutral attendance patterns. See Mar-\ntin, 475 F. Supp. at 1340. As for the Bakke decision, the district court\npointed out that no student in CMS was denied \"an equal educational\n\n                  92\n\fopportunity\" and that the admissions policy in Bakke was imple-\nmented \"against a backdrop devoid of specific judicial findings or\nadministrative acknowledgments of the prior segregated status of the\nschool system.\" Id. at 1345. Accordingly, the Martin court concluded\nthat CMS's reassignment of students was \"within constitutional limits\nand should be upheld.\" Id. at 1321. The district court took pains to\nensure that its opinion would not be interpreted too broadly: \"This\norder simply upholds the actions of the 1978 Board against the attacks\nby the plaintiffs.\" Id. at 1347. In the course of the Martin opinion, the\ndistrict court observed that CMS had fallen short in four areas: con-\nstruction and location of facilities in parts of the county likely to\nenhance desegregation, placement of elementary and kindergarten\ngrades in schools throughout the county, monitoring of student trans-\nfers so as to prevent resegregation, and allocation of the burdens of\nbusing. See id. at 1328-29. However, the district court also noted that\nCMS had made great progress and that a return to the old system of\nsegregation \"has not tempted the present School Board, who are\nstanding fast in their endeavor to run the schools according to law\nwhile providing quality education.\" Id. at 1347.\n\nIn Capacchione, the district court correctly observed that \"Martin\nwas not a unitary status hearing,\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250,\nand that because \"the desegregation plan was still in its fledgling\nstages, the Court was inclined to keep the pressure on CMS,\" id. at\n251. The Capacchione court further observed that post-Martin\nchanges in Charlotte-Mecklenburg counseled looking at the \"concerns\n[of Martin] in a new light.\" Id. The district court's interpretation of\nMartin is reasonable and in accord with the rule in this circuit that a\ndistrict court, as a continuous institution, is\"best able to interpret its\nown orders.\" Vaughns v. Board of Educ., 758 F.2d 983, 989 (4th Cir.\n1985) (school desegregation case). Moreover, the Martin order was\nissued thirteen years before the Supreme Court made clear in Free-\nman that the affirmative measures mandated by Green are not meant\nto remedy \"private choices\" that lead to resegregation. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 495. The state of the law and the understanding of duties upon\nschool districts were far different when Martin was handed down.\nHence, a number of assertions in Martin cannot be squared with the\npresent state of the law. See, e.g., Martin 475 F. Supp. at 1346 (stating\nthat segregated housing patterns must necessarily lead to the unconsti-\ntutional segregation of schools). Ignoring the changes in Charlotte-\n\n                  93\n\fMecklenburg and in the law by erecting Martin as the framework for\nunitary status, as the Swann plaintiffs urged below, would defy com-\nmon sense and run afoul of developments in the Supreme Court's\nschool desegregation jurisprudence. See United States Gypsum Co. v.\nSchiavo Bros., 668 F.2d 172, 176 (3d Cir. 1981) (concluding that a\nsuccessor judge \"is empowered to reconsider [the legal conclusions of\nan unavailable predecessor] to the same extent that his or her pre-\ndecessor could have\"). I will examine the district court's Martin find-\nings in turn.\n\na. School Siting\n\nThe district court found that CMS had not shirked its duties under\nthe law with regard to school sitings. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp.\n2d at 251-53. The record reveals that CMS has, to the extent practica-\nble, continually endeavored to site schools in order to foster integra-\ntion, and has adopted a policy of building schools in areas equally\naccessible to blacks and whites. Testimony of current board members\nindicated that in efforts to fulfill this policy, CMS has purchased\nproperty in low growth areas for school construction even though\nschools in predominantly white high growth areas were overcrowded.\nSee J.A. V-1986-87. In 1992 CMS reaffirmed its siting policy and\nresolved that, \"whenever possible,\" new schools would be built in\nareas that would \"provide black student enrollment of not less than 10\npercent from the census tracts serving the new school.\" J.A. XXXII-\n15,686. The impetus behind the resolution was growth in the periph-\nery of the county which the board speculated would continue patterns\nof housing segregation, thus making it more difficult to maintain\nracial balance in the schools. Evidence presented at trial indicated that\nthe ten percent rule was destined for failure because it was not possi-\nble to implement the rule and still \"meet the 60-minute bus ride\nlimit.\" J.A. XXII-10,869. Nevertheless, extensive evidence was pres-\nented showing that CMS never sited schools in order to foster segre-\ngation and that \"every effort was made to try to find school sites that\nwould bring people together in balanced numbers.\" J.A. VI-2752. For\nexample, CMS's executive director of planning and student place-\nment testified that in siting schools CMS \"looked at both African-\nAmerican and all populations not only in the vicinity of the site, but\nin the entire district.\" J.A. VII-2920. So dedicated was CMS to siting\nschools in integrated areas that it contemplated refusing a gift of land\n\n                   94\n\ffor school use because the land was in a predominantly white area.\nSee J.A. V-1985.\n\nFaced with growth in the predominantly white regions of the far\nsouth and north, see J.A. XXXIII-16,261, CMS was compelled to\nserve populations in those areas via school sitings. CMS's data show\nthat in the late 1990s, student population was \"growing at nearly\n4,000 students per year,\" J.A. XXIX-14,133, and consequently the\nboard was \"just trying to keep up\" with the population explosion in\nbuilding schools, J.A. V-2249. Overcrowding was a problem, and in\nthe late 1990s \"the average high school expected to operate at 109\npercent of its capacity.\" J.A. XXIX-14,133. Even though CMS was\nforced to build schools at a rapid rate to serve an expanding student\npopulation, pupil assignment plans in which CMS described popula-\ntion growth as a \"major consideration[ ]\" are replete with efforts to\nimprove racial balance. J.A. XXIX-14,133. For example, the 1997-98\nassignment plan highlighted the creation and expansion of several\nmagnet programs specially designed to reduce the black ratio in a\nnumber of schools. See J.A. XXIX-14,147-51. To the extent practica-\nble, CMS did not sacrifice racial balance concerns to population\ngrowth. Though the two often pulled CMS in different directions, the\nrecord indicates that the board coordinated racial balance and school\nsitings as best it could under the circumstances. The evidence does\nnot indicate that the abandonment of the ten percent rule or other\ndecisions regarding school siting were the result of a desire to perpet-\nuate the dual school system or circumvent the district court's orders.\n\nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs, citing to prior orders, contend that\nthe board has not done all that it could do in the area of school siting.\nErection of such a standard, however, would effectively replace prac-\nticability with possibility. The former implies measures that can be\nreasonably implemented under the circumstances, while the latter\nomits the reasonableness requirement. For instance, it was possible\nfor CMS to adhere to the ten percent rule while ignoring growth in\nthe far north and south of the county. Youngsters would have been\ncompelled to ride buses for long periods while traveling with the flow\nof rush hour traffic, but it was nonetheless possible to adhere to the\nten percent rule. Of course, the practicability of a refusal to respond\nto growth in Charlotte-Mecklenburg is another matter.\n\n                  95\n\fIn the same vein, the Swann plaintiffs contend that school siting\ndecisions were a response to white flight, which is an impermissible\nreason for failing to comply with a desegregation order. Growth, of\ncourse, is far different from flight. And experts offered evidence of\n\"the economic boom in the Charlotte Metropolitan area in the last\ndecade.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,233. Charlotte-Mecklenburg is one of the\nmost dynamic areas in the South; it is far different from the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg of Swann, and much changed from that of Martin. In\nlight of the growth in the county and a plethora of evidence demon-\nstrating that the board used its best efforts to site schools in order to\nfoster integration, the district court did not commit error when it con-\ncluded that there is no \"continuing constitutional violation[ ] in the\narea of school siting.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253.\n\nb. Burdens of Busing\n\nAs for the burdens of busing, the district court found that in the\nmost recent school year, 15,533 black students and 11,184 non-black\nstudents were bused for balancing purposes. Id. As stated earlier, traf-\nfic patterns make busing suburban students into the inner city far\nmore difficult than busing inner-city children into the suburbs. See\nJ.A. VI-2732; J.A. V-2228. Though a disproportionate number of\nAfrican-American students are bused, the growth and housing pat-\nterns support the district court's conclusion that the realities of the\ncurrent situation should not block a unitary status determination.\n\nc. Student Transfers\n\nFinally, Martin's concern with student transfers appears to have\nbeen based on the assumption that CMS would experience average\ngrowth. Courts are not omniscient, and the district court in 1979 could\nnot have foreseen the changing demographics that would make stu-\ndent transfers the least of CMS's worries. In the present litigation, the\ndistrict court observed \"that CMS `kept an eye on [magnet transfers]\nso that there wouldn't be a run on the bank so to speak from any one\nschool.'\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 250 n.10 (alteration in origi-\nnal). This finding is not clearly erroneous, nor can I discern the need\nfor more findings on this issue in light of post-Martin changes.\n\n                  96\n\f3. Conclusion\n\nIn sum, the district court's findings on student assignment are\n\"plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\" Anderson, 470\nU.S. at 573. The dual system of student assignment in CMS has been\neradicated \"to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250. The\nimbalance existing in some schools is not traceable to the former dual\nsystem or to renewed discriminatory actions, but rather is a result of\ngrowth and shifting demographics. Consequently, I would hold that\nthe district court's findings on student assignment are not clearly erro-\nneous.\n\nB. Faculty Assignment\n\nIn examining faculty assignment, the district again used a\nplus/minus fifteen percent variance. Of the 126 schools operating in\nCMS, the district court found that in 1997-98 only ten schools were\nout of balance. The Swann plaintiffs point out that this number grew\nto sixteen in 1998-99, but this means that a mere twelve percent of\nthe schools were out of balance. This is a far cry from the dual system\nin which \"most of the 24,000 [black students] ha[d] no white teach-\ners.\" Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360. There is simply no evidence that\nCMS assigns black teachers to predominantly black schools and white\nteachers to predominantly white schools. Thus, like the majority, I\nbelieve that the district court's conclusion that this Green factor has\nbeen satisfied is not clearly erroneous.\n\nC. Facilities and Resources\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs and CMS contend that the district court\nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this factor. The majority\nagrees with this argument, concluding that the improper allocation of\nthe burden of proof amounts to an error of law and that this issue\ntherefore must be remanded to the district court. I respectfully dis-\nagree.\n\nThis court has previously made clear that \"once a court has found\nan unlawful dual school system, [those alleging the existence of racial\ndisparities] are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are\n\n                  97\n\fcausally related to prior segregation, and the burden of proving other-\nwise rests on the defendants.\" School Bd. of the City of Richmond v.\nBaliles, 829 F.2d 1308, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). In this case, however,\nthe district court noted that none of the prior orders entered in the\nlong history of the Swann litigation had ever found racial disparities\nto exist with regard to school facilities and concluded that CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing discrimination\nwith regard to facilities. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 263 (\"[I]t\nwould defy logic to place now the burden of proof on the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors, requiring them to prove that vestiges of discrimination in\nfacilities have been remedied, when the Court originally found no\nvestiges to exist.\"). In my view, this erroneous assignment of the bur-\nden of proof, which did not affect the manner in which the parties\ntried the case or otherwise prejudice their rights, is harmless and does\nnot undermine the district court's factual conclusions regarding the\nfacilities factor.6\n                  6\n\nImmediately after assigning the burden to CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs, the district court's order nonetheless summarized and\nweighed the facilities evidence presented by the parties. The district\ncourt carefully analyzed the testimony and report of Dr. Dwayne\nGardner, an expert witness for CMS. Dr. Gardner analyzed seventy-\nthree schools--every identifiably black school in CMS and a sam-\npling of balanced schools and predominantly white schools. Dr. Gard-\nner measured the adequacy, safety, healthfulness, accessibility,\nflexibility, efficiency, expansibility, and appearance of the schools.\nBased on the inspection he grouped schools as follows: \"0-44 (sug-\ngests replacement), 45-59 (needs major improvement), 60-74 (needs\nminor improvement), 75-89 (serves program needs), and 90-100\n(exceptional quality).\" Id. at 264. The survey revealed that of the four\nschools that warranted replacement, two were majority white, and two\nwere imbalanced black. See J.A. XXV-12,182-86. Thirty-four schools\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Given the counter-intuitive alignment of the parties in this case, it\ncould be argued that the presumption and burden allocation set forth in\nBaliles should not be applied, and that CMS should instead be required\nto prove the existence of racial disparity in its facilities. See United\nStates v. City of Yonkers, 181 F.3d 301, 309-11 (2d Cir. 1999), vacated\non reh'g, 197 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n                  98\n\ffell into the \"needs major improvement\" category, of which sixteen\nwere imbalanced black and eighteen identifiably white.\n\nThe district court determined that Dr. Gardner's testimony estab-\nlished that any current disparities were functions of the age of the\nfacilities at issue, because\n\n        different building standards apply when a new facility is\n        constructed as compared to when an older facility is reno-\n        vated or upgraded. In other words, the renovation of an\n        older facility usually complies with the code under which\n        the facility was built. Because most facilities in the predomi-\n        nately black inner city are older while facilities in the pre-\n        dominately white suburbs are newer, the inference is that\n        differences in building standards tend to affect black stu-\n        dents disproportionately. This does not amount to racial dis-\n        crimination. Indeed, this practice applies regardless of the\n        racial composition of the school. Thus, older schools that\n        are predominately white--several of which were built in the\n        1920s--are likewise affected by this practice.\n\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (footnote and transcript refer-\nences omitted). Thus, the district court concluded from Dr. Gardner's\ntestimony and report \"that CMS's facilities needs are spread across\nthe system without regard to the racial composition of its schools.\" Id.\n\nThe district court also considered the testimony of CMS's assistant\nsuperintendent of building services, who testified that out of 108\nschools in need of renovations, eighty-one percent were racially bal-\nanced or identifiably white. See J.A. VIII-3810 & 3818. The district\ncourt concluded that this witness's testimony likewise demonstrated\nthat the deficiencies in CMS's facilities were unrelated to the former\nde jure system.\n\nFinally, the court considered CMS's track record in renovating old\nfacilities, praising its practice of allocating funds on a per-pupil basis\nand noting that \"CMS has spent a large portion of[its] bond money\non improving schools in predominantly black areas.\" Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 266.\n\n                   99\n\fAfter an extensive discussion of this evidence, the court made the\nfollowing finding of fact with regard to facilities:\n\n       Just as Judge McMillan found thirty years ago, the Court\n       finds today that inequities in facilities exist throughout the\n       system regardless of the racial makeup of the school. These\n       disparities are generally the result of the relative ages of the\n       facilities, combined with an ongoing lack of funding and the\n       need to accommodate unprecedented growth.\n\nId.\n\nThis finding is clearly determinative of the question of unitary sta-\ntus as to facilities, regardless of which party carried the burden of\nproof. That is, the district court, after carefully considering and\nweighing all the evidence presented on this factor, concluded that any\ndisparity as to the condition of the facilities that might exist was not\ncaused by any intentional discrimination by CMS, but instead was a\nfunction of the age and location of the facilities and the ever-present\nproblem of allocating all too scarce funds. Even if the district court\nhad assigned the burden of proof to the plaintiff-intervenors, this fac-\ntual finding would have compelled a ruling in their favor. In fact, the\ndistrict court acknowledged as much, stating \"that the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors have proven, to the extent possible, the absence of intent\nand causation.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267 n.38.7\n                                                        7\n\nTherefore, because the district court's findings, which were based\non the court's weighing of all of the relevant evidence presented at\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 From this footnote and the district court's detailed discussion about\nthe cause of any disparity in CMS's facilities, it appears that the district\ncourt really made alternative rulings on the facilities question: The court\nfirst concluded that CMS and the Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of\nproof with regard to facilities and that they failed to carry that burden.\nSee Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 267 (\"[T]he Swann Plaintiffs have\nfailed to overcome the Court's previous findings on facilities by estab-\nlishing the requisite discriminatory intent and causation.\"). The court\nthen ruled in the alternative, as indicated by the footnote and the find-\nings, that the plaintiff-intervenors proved that any disparities were the\nresult of factors unrelated to state action.\n\n                  100\n\ftrial, would have yielded the same conclusion under a proper assign-\nment of the burden of proof, any error with regard to the burden of\nproof is harmless. See Washington State Dep't of Transp. v. Washing-\nton Natural Gas Co., 59 F.3d 793, 801 (9th Cir. 1995) (finding dis-\ntrict court's improper assignment of the burden of proof to be\nharmless because review of the entire record established \"that under\nthe proper assignment of the burden of proof, the district court would\nhave reached the same decision\"); Applewood Landscape & Nursery\nCo. v. Hollingsworth, 884 F.2d 1502, 1506 (1st Cir. 1989) (conclud-\ning that, if the district court improperly allocated burden of proof on\na particular issue, the error was harmless because the district court's\ndecision on that issue turned on the weight of the evidence in the\nrecord and not on burden of proof rules); cf. Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 992\n(recognizing that an error in shifting the burden of proof in a school\ndesegregation case may be harmless if the record is such that the court\ncan conclude that substantial rights have not been prejudiced).\n\nBecause any error associated with the burden of proof is harmless,\nthe only question that remains is whether the district court's factual\nfindings about the facilities are clearly erroneous. Contrary to the\nmajority's analysis of Dr. Gardner's report and its discussion of \"an-\necdotal accounts of a number of witnesses,\" ante at 40, I simply can-\nnot conclude that the data and other evidence in the record show the\ndistrict court's findings on this Green factor to be implausible. See\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 574. The majority is certainly correct that \"lies,\ndamned lies, and statistics\" are subject to \"selective culling\" and can\nsupport varying interpretations of the evidence. Ante at 39-40 n.14.\nThe briefs of the parties make this obvious. Though the evidence\ncould have been weighed differently on this factor, \"[w]here there are\ntwo permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice\nbetween them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson, 470 U.S. at\n574. In 1969, the district court found that there was no constitutional\nviolation in the \"quality of school buildings and facilities.\" Swann,\n300 F. Supp. at 1372. The Capacchione court found that this remains\ntrue today, and the evidence as a whole indicates that this finding is\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\nD. Transportation\n\nThe parties do not dispute the district court's finding that \"CMS\nprovides free bus transportation to all students who do not live within\n\n                    101\n\fa mile and a half of their schools.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at\n267. The focus of the Swann plaintiffs' argument on this factor deals\nwith the Martin opinion. As previously discussed, Martin does not\nprovide the framework for a unitary status determination and the dis-\ntrict court's interpretation of Martin, along with the finding that the\npresent state of busing \"may be about the best CMS can do,\" Capac-\nchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 253, does not constitute error.\n\nE. Staff Assignment\n\nThe district court, noting that findings of discrimination in school\nstaffing were never made, concluded that CMS has complied with its\nconstitutional duties. The parties point this court to no contrary evi-\ndence, nor have I discovered such in the record. Therefore, I concur\nwith the majority that the district court's findings regarding the fifth\nGreen factor are not clearly erroneous.\n\nF. Extracurricular Activities\n\nThe district court concluded that there was no discrimination or\nvestiges of discrimination with regard to extracurricular activities.\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that the ratios of blacks and\nwhites participating in extracurricular activities, though varying\nsomewhat from year to year, is approximately equal. See J.A. XXIV-\n11,634. Areas where there are disparities were not shown to be linked\nto the former dual system. For example, blacks often outnumber\nwhites in holding elective offices in student government, but whites\nhave a higher level of representation in honors programs. No evidence\nis found in the record to indicate that CMS somehow pushes African-\nAmericans toward student government and away from honors pro-\ngrams. In sum, I agree with the majority that the district court's con-\nclusion that CMS has satisfied this Green factor is not clearly\nerroneous.\n\nG. Ancillary Factors\n\n1. Teacher Quality\n\nThe district court found that there was no discrimination in the\nquality of teaching. The Swann plaintiffs contend this finding is\n\n                     102\n\fclearly erroneous because students in imbalanced African-American\nschools are more likely to have inexperienced teachers. This \"experi-\nence gap,\" to the extent it exists, is minuscule. The district court\nfound that \"teachers in imbalanced-black schools had 0.7 to 1.3 fewer\nyears experience than the district averages and had 1.6 to 2.9 fewer\nyears experience than teachers in imbalanced-white schools.\" Capac-\nchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 271. To use middle school teachers as an\nexample, the statistics reveal that the average middle school teacher\nin an imbalanced African-American school had 8.2 years experience\nversus 9.8 years for his counterpart in an imbalanced white school. Id.\nThese numbers clearly support a finding of equality rather than dis-\nparity, and cannot undermine the district court's conclusion on this\nfactor. The district court also pointed to evidence indicating that expe-\nrience does not necessarily relate to competency. For example,\naccording to former Superintendent Murphy, it is not uncommon to\nhave \"excellent first-year teachers\" and \"very weak 35th-year teach-\ners.\" J.A. VI-2795. Other witnesses observed that the newer teachers\nhad better \"knowledge of various teaching strategies\" and were more\ncomfortable with diverse classrooms. J.A. VII-3275.\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs also assert that imbalanced African-American\nschools have fewer teachers with advanced degrees. For instance, in\nimbalanced black high schools only thirty-one percent of the teachers\nheld advanced degrees, while forty-six percent of the teachers in\nimbalanced white high schools held advanced degrees. See Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 271. As it was with teacher experience, testi-\nmony was offered establishing that the number of degrees a teacher\npossesses does not necessarily translate into competence or quality\ninstruction. See J.A. VII-3276. According to former Superintendent\nMurphy, \"the degree level was not a significant indicator of getting\nbetter performance on the part of the teacher.\" J.A. VI-2795. Expert\nreports submitted by the plaintiff-intervenors also indicated that there\nis \"no significant relationship\" between black achievement and\nteacher education levels. J.A. XXXIII-16,221. In sum, I agree with\nthe majority that the district court's conclusion that African-American\nstudents receive equal access to quality teachers is not clearly errone-\nous.\n\n2. Student Achievement\n\nThe district court found that the existence of an achievement gap\nbetween black and white students was not a vestige of the dual system\n\n                  103\n\for evidence of discrimination in the current operation of CMS. This\nwas an area of immense disagreement at trial, and the parties\npresented a mountain of data on this subject. Though the Fourteenth\nAmendment guarantees equal protection but not equal outcomes, if\nlow African-American achievement is a result of the former de jure\nsystem, it must be eliminated to the extent practicable. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 249-50. Conversely, to the extent that low achievement\nis linked to other factors, it is beyond the reach of the court's author-\nity. Most courts of appeals confronting this issue, including this court,\nhave declined to consider the achievement gap as a vestige of dis-\ncrimination or as evidence of current discrimination. See Baliles, 829\nF.2d at 1313 (upholding lower court's findings that low achievement\nis \"primarily attributable to the high incidence of poverty\" in the\nschool district); see also, United States v. City of Yonkers, 197 F.3d\n41, 54 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that \"using achievement test scores\nas a measure, either direct or indirect, of a school system's movement\naway from segregation is deeply problematic\"); People Who Care v.\nRockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 537 (7th Cir. 1997) (explaining\nthat a number of variables, other than discrimination, account for the\nachievement gap); Coalition to Save Our Children, 90 F.3d at 778\n(finding \"a causal link between . . . socioeconomic factors and student\nachievement\").\n\nThe plaintiff-intervenors' expert witness, Dr. Armor, presented evi-\ndence indicating that there is no correlation between African-\nAmerican performance and the racial balance of schools. See J.A.\nXXXIII-16,178. For example, Dr. Armor's studies showed that\nAfrican-American students in the third through fifth grades attending\nschools sixteen to twenty-five percent African-American scored the\nsame on standardized tests as their counterparts in schools seventy-\nfive percent black or greater. See J.A. at 16,214. Similarly, African-\nAmerican students in the sixth through eighth grades attending\nschools sixteen percent black or less scored the same on standardized\ntests as their counterparts in schools seventy-five percent black or\ngreater. See J.A. XXXIII-16,215.\n\nIn order to shed light on the true causes of the achievement gap,\nDr. Armor turned to socioeconomic factors. The data revealed star-\ntling differences between black and white children in CMS.\n\n                  104\n\f        Average black family income is $31,000 compared to\n        $59,000 for whites, and only 15 [percent] of black parents\n        are college graduates, compared to 58 percent for white par-\n        ents. A huge poverty gap is also revealed, with 63 percent\n        of black students on free lunch compared to only 9 percent\n        of white students. Finally, 83 percent of white students have\n        both parents at home, compared to only 42 percent for black\n        students.\n\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,179. According to Dr. Armor, the socioeconomic fac-\ntors plus the second grade scores, which are the earliest available,\nexplain \"nearly 80 percent of the reading gap and over 70 percent of\nthe math gap.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,180. Former Superintendent Murphy\nalso testified that in his experience \"[p]oor students come behind and\nstay that way. And in Charlotte, a majority of poor students happen\nto be African-American.\" J.A. VI-2696. Dan Saltrick, former assistant\nsuperintendent for instructional services, also testified that in his\nexperience low student test scores related to parental support which\nin turn was \"a matter of . . . socioeconomic levels.\" J.A. VII-3280.\nWhile socioeconomic disparities between black and white pupils are\ntroubling, they are not the result of CMS's actions or inactions and\ntherefore are beyond the scope of the original desegregation order.\nSee Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1314 (\"Educational deficiencies that result\nfrom problems such as poverty are best remedied by programs\ndirected toward eliminating poverty, not by indirect solutions through\nschool programs.\").8 8 Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err\nin finding that the achievement gap between black and white students\nis not a vestige of past discrimination or evidence of present discrimi-\nnation.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8 Despite evidence that the achievement gap results from factors out-\nside CMS's control, the district court found that CMS has undertaken\nsundry measures to eliminate the gap. For example, CMS adopted finan-\ncial incentives for teachers and principals tied to student performance,\nurged black students to take advanced placement and other higher level\nclasses, challenged all students by removing \"fluff courses\" from the cur-\nriculum, provided tutors and other forms of staff support to accelerate\nstudent preparedness, and adopted pre-kindergarten programs to acceler-\nate preparedness for the youngest of students. See Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 273-275.\n\n                   105\n\f3. Student Discipline\n\nThe district court found \"that any disparities that exist in the area\nof discipline are not causally related to the dual system.\" Capacch-\nione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 281. In none of the court's prior orders is there\nany indication that CMS has ever discriminated in meting out punish-\nment for disruptive students. However, recent statistics show that of\nthe 13,206 students disciplined from 1996-98, sixty-six percent were\nAfrican-American. See J.A. XXIV-11,637. As the district court noted,\n\"disparity does not, by itself, constitute discrimination.\" Capacchione,\n57 F. Supp. 2d at 281. The idea that CMS should have a disciplinary\nquota is patently absurd, and there is no evidence in the record that\nCMS targets African-American students for discipline. Instead, the\nevidence indicates that CMS has adopted guidelines whereby students\nreceive the same level of punishment for certain offenses to ensure\nthat the amount of punishment will not vary from school to school.\nA student charged with a disciplinary infraction may also appeal the\ncharge \"and may assert that the charge was due to racial bias.\" Id.\nThere is simply no evidence in the record that CMS treats African-\nAmerican students differently in disciplinary matters. Hence, the dis-\ntrict court's conclusion that the disciplinary disparities are unrelated\nto the former de jure system is not clearly erroneous.\n\nH. Good Faith\n\nLastly, the district court found that CMS has complied with the\ndesegregation decree in good faith. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491\n(requiring school board \"to demonstrate its good-faith commitment to\na constitutional course of action\"). Seven factors supported the district\ncourt's good-faith finding: (1) no further relief has been sought since\nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975; (2)\nCMS has gone above and beyond the court's orders by continually\nstriving to achieve balance even when the imbalance was uncon-\nnected to the dual system; (3) the board has been open to community\ninput and sought community support for its integrative efforts; (4) the\nboard has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to desegregation\nthrough various resolutions; (5) African-Americans currently occupy\nfour of the nine seats on the school board, including the chair; (6) the\nboard's actions over the past thirty years do not evince discriminatory\nmotives; and (7) \"no evidence has been presented that school authori-\n\n                  106\n\fties were guilty of easily correctable errors.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 282-83.\n\nTestimony from former board members indicated that the court's\norder has been \"institutionalized,\" J.A. V-2222, and that the board \"al-\nways stuck to what the rules were.\" J.A. V-2234. Former Superinten-\ndent Murphy testified that when he arrived in Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhe found a \"unique\" environment where \"everybody wanted to make\nsure that their schools were racially balanced.\" J.A. VI-2686. In 1992,\nDr. Stolee suggested a magnet plan to increase integration, and, in the\ncourse of his recommendations, observed that \"[f]or the last twenty\nyears, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education and the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg community have, in good faith, complied\nwith the orders of the court.\" J.A. XXXII-15,570. He further observed\n\"that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board and community have a great\ndeal of pride in the fact that they successfully met a challenge and\nmade the solution work.\" J.A. XXXII-15,571.\n\nOf course, both in the district court and in appellate arguments,\ncurrent CMS officials engaged in much self-recrimination, described\nby the majority as \"frank acquiescence in a position inuring to [their]\ndetriment.\" Ante at 34. The district court gave little weight to CMS's\nassertions that the board had not put forth enough effort, and the evi-\ndence presented at trial amply supports the district court in this\nregard. Former Superintendent Murphy testified that despite a report\nindicating that CMS was unitary and his belief that CMS \"w[as] defi-\nnitely in compliance,\" no effort was made to dissolve the court order.\nJ.A. VI-2706. Dr. Murphy gave three reasons for the avoidance of a\nunitary status hearing. First, he advised board members that the court\nhearing would be \"a long, drawn-out process which would cost mil-\nlions of dollars, and that would be money taken away from the\ninstructional program.\" J.A. VI-2706. Second, Dr. Murphy feared that\nif CMS was declared unitary \"we would not be eligible for federal\nfunding for our magnet schools.\" J.A. VI-2706. Finally, Dr. Murphy\nthought it best to remain under court order so CMS could continue to\nracially balance schools even though the de jure violation had been\nremedied.\n\nDr. Susan Purser, the current associate superintendent of education\nservices of CMS, expressed a similar desire for CMS to remain under\n\n                  107\n\fcourt order. Though Dr. Purser testified that she believed that the\nschool board, superintendent, and administration were dedicated to\nenhancing educational opportunities for all of CMS's students regard-\nless of race, she nonetheless expressed a preference for court supervi-\nsion. Dr. Purser pointed out that the current \"Board has only a limited\ntime, because these are elected positions,\" J.A. XVII-8076, and that\nover time \"superintendents will change, [and] the people involved in\n[CMS] will change.\" J.A. XVII-8077. At this point in the cross exam-\nination, counsel asked Dr. Purser: \"But you don't know what any\nfuture School Board or administration will do either way, do you?\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser responded: \"That's exactly my point.\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser's testimony and that of Dr. Murphy exem-\nplify why the Supreme Court has stressed that \"federal supervision of\nlocal school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy\npast discrimination.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247; see also Coalition to\nSave Our Children, 90 F.3d at 761 n.6 (warning of \"the potential for\nthe entrenchment of [a] putatively transitional desegregation\nscheme\"). The district court's desegregation order was not intended\nto continue after CMS remedied the de jure violation, nor was it\nintended to suspend the democratic process with no prospect of resto-\nration. Yet it has been institutionalized to the point that CMS officials\ncannot imagine life without it. Contrary to assertions of the majority,\nthe desegregation order is certainly not viewed as \"detrimental\" by\nCMS officials. See ante at 34.\n\nIronically, CMS's clinging to the temporary desegregation order\nbuttresses the district court's finding that it is unlikely \"CMS would\nreturn to an intentionally-segregative system.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. at 284. If CMS will go to such lengths to keep the court's order\nin place so that it may continue racial balancing and other policies,\nit is unthinkable that CMS will attempt to revive the dual system.\nAccordingly, the district judge's finding of good faith is not clearly\nerroneous.\n\nI. CMS's Remedial Plan\n\nAs a response to the plaintiff-intervenors' push for unitary status,\nCMS developed a remedial plan addressing many of the Green factors\nand other ancillary factors. See J.A. XXIII-11,028. The district court\ndismissed the remedial plan as a \"`litigation strategy' plan\" and\n\n                  108\n\fdeclined to consider it. Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 256. The\nmajority, in reversing the unitary status determination, describes the\ndistrict court's treatment of the remedial plan as\"a fundamental flaw\nin the district court's proceedings.\" Ante at 24. First, the majority\navers that the district court misconstrued the test for unitary status.\nAccording to the majority, a district court must ask (1) what a school\ndistrict has done in the past, and (2) what a school district may do in\nthe future. See ante at 25. Because the district court allegedly failed\nto undertake the latter inquiry as to the remedial plan, the majority\nholds that the district court's order must be reversed. The majority\ndivines its two-part test from Supreme Court cases which have\ninstructed district courts to ask \"whether the Board ha[s] complied in\ngood faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and\nwhether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to\nthe extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50; see also Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n\nWhile I agree with my colleagues on the first prong of their test,\nI do not agree that examining \"whether the vestiges of past discrimi-\nnation ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable,\" Dowell, 498\nU.S. at 249-50, requires a district court--as a matter of law--to con-\nsider a remedial plan conceived, drafted, and offered by one of the\nparties during the lawsuit as an obvious defense to it. The plain mean-\ning of the relevant language is that in some desegregation cases sim-\nple compliance with the court's orders is not enough for meaningful\ndesegregation to take place. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25 (stating that\n\"a district court's remedial decree is to be judged by its effective-\nness\"). For example, a decree entered in the 1960s or 1970s could\nhave underestimated the extent of the remedy required, or changes in\nthe school district could have rendered the decree obsolete. In either\ncase, a district court must look beyond mere compliance with the\noriginal decree and ask whether the vestiges of the dual system have\nbeen eliminated to the extent practicable. In the present case, the dis-\ntrict court undertook such an inquiry. Not only did the district court\naddress compliance, but it also looked beyond the original decree and\nexamined how the extensive changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\narea have affected the dismantling of the former dual system. Hence,\nI do not believe that Dowell and Freeman required the district court\nas a matter of law to have considered CMS's eleventh-hour remedial\nplan.\n\n                  109\n\fLikewise, I do not believe that the district court ran afoul of Fed-\neral Rule of Evidence 402 when it refused to consider the remedial\nplan. Rule 402, of course, declares that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is\nadmissible.\" Even relevant evidence may be excluded, however, when\nits probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of\nthe needless presentation of cumulative evidence. See Fed. R. Evid.\n403. And CMS's remedial plan was certainly cumulative, citing and\nsummarizing several expert reports which had been admitted into evi-\ndence. For example, the plan's discussion of faculty assignment is\nbased on the reports of Dr. William Trent, Dr. Robert Peterkin, and\nDr. Roslyn Mickelson; the plan's discussion of facilities is based on\nDr. Gardner's report; the plan's discussion of the achievement gap\nbetween blacks and whites is based on the reports of Dr. Trent, Dr.\nPeterkin, and Dr. Mickelson; and the plan's student assignment dis-\ncussion is based on Dr. Gordon Foster's report. All of the aforemen-\ntioned reports were admitted into evidence and the authors of the\nreports testified at the hearing and were subject to cross-examination.\nHence, much of the remedial plan was cumulative, providing the dis-\ntrict court with but a rehashing of expert reports and testimony.\n\nTo the extent that the remedial plan contained relevant evidence\nappearing nowhere else in the record, I would hold that the exclusion\nof such evidence was harmless. According to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 61, a \"court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard\nany error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the sub-\nstantial rights of the parties.\" Listing myriad deficiencies, objectives,\nand strategies, the thirty-one page remedial plan is often short on spe-\ncifics. Considering the amount of evidence presented on every aspect\nof CMS's operations during other phases of the two-month bench\ntrial, I cannot hold that the exclusion of the remedial plan affected\nCMS's substantial rights. See Ingram Coal Co. v. Mower, L.P., 892\nF.2d 363, 366 (4th Cir. 1989) (applying Rule 61). Because the exclu-\nsion of the remedial plan in no way renders the judgment below sus-\npect, the district court's treatment of the plan cannot support reversal.\n\nIII. Magnet Schools\n\nI turn now to Capacchione's challenge to CMS's 1992 magnet\nschools plan. Specifically, Capacchione contends that his daughter\n\n                  110\n\fChristina was unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school\nprogram on account of her race.\n\nAs noted previously, CMS operated its schools in nearly perfect\nracial balance for almost twenty years under a pupil assignment plan,\nadopted by the board and approved by the district court in 1974,\nwhich primarily utilized \"optional schools,\" paired elementary\nschools, satellite attendance zones, and a feeder system. In 1991,\nhowever, CMS hired Dr. Stolee to examine racial imbalance that was\nbeing caused anew by the demographic shifts and population growth\nin the City of Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County and, in\n1992, implemented a new pupil assignment plan drafted by Dr.\nStolee, entitled \"CMS Student Assignment Plan: A New Generation\nof Excellence.\" This new plan emphasized the use of magnet schools,\nwhich would allow CMS to phase out the more unpopular paired ele-\nmentary schools. Magnet schools, many of which were located in pre-\ndominately black neighborhoods, offered a specialized curriculum or\ninnovative instructional style not found in the other schools in the sys-\ntem.\n\nFormer Superintendent Murphy oversaw implementation of the\nStolee plan and testified that the magnet program was adopted\nbecause CMS \"wanted to attract more white youngsters into the inner\ncity schools\" in order to meet CMS's racial-balance goals. J.A. VI-\n2709. Dr. Stolee observed in his report that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhas had a long and successful experience with mandatory school\nassignments,\" but that in order to combat demographic shifts CMS\nshould adopt a plan based on voluntarism. J.A. XXXII-15,581; see\nalso Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 92 (1995) (Jenkins III)\n(\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging voluntary move-\nment of students within a school district in a pattern that aids desegre-\ngation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and\nredrawing of district boundary lines.\"). A desegregation plan using\nmagnet schools, according to Dr. Stolee, would \"give[ ] each parent\nan opportunity to make a choice between a school serving the area in\nwhich the family resides, a school in some other area, or a school\noffering a very specific attractive program.\" J.A. XXXII-15,580. Dr.\nStolee also recognized that the magnet-centered plan would be a dra-\nmatic shift from the prior desegregation plan. Thus, as part of the\nplan, he recommended that CMS secure approval from the district\n\n                  111\n\fcourt before making any changes. Indeed, Dr. Stolee's \"RECOM-\nMENDATION #1,\" out of forty-four, read:\n\n        THE SCHOOL BOARD, THROUGH LEGAL COUNSEL,\n        SHOULD APPROACH THE FEDERAL COURT TO\n        SECURE APPROVAL TO CHANGE THE COURT-\n        ORDERED DESEGREGATION PLAN.\n\nJ.A. XXXII-15,578. This recommendation was consistent with the\nprior district court order directing CMS to apply to the district court\n\"before making any material departure\" from the approved desegrega-\ntion plan. Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 270. However, CMS ignored Dr.\nStolee's advice and the district court's instruction, choosing instead\nto withhold these changes in the desegregation plan from the district\ncourt.\n\nThe crux of the problem with CMS's magnet school plan is its\nadmissions process. As aptly described by the district court, it oper-\nates as follows:\n\n        At the start of the process, CMS first fills seats with prefer-\n        ences based on whether the applicant lives in close proxim-\n        ity to the school and whether the applicant has any siblings\n        in the school. CMS then fills the remaining seats by select-\n        ing students from a black lottery and a non-black lottery\n        until the precise racial balance is achieved.\n\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 287 (internal citations omitted). Seek-\ning a balance of sixty percent white and forty percent black in the\nmagnet schools, CMS decreed in its 1992 student assignment plan\nthat magnet \"slots reserved for one race will not be filled by students\nof another race.\" J.A. XXXII-15,702. The result of this policy was\nthat if a sufficient number of blacks or whites did not apply and fill\nthe seats allotted to their respective races, then those seats would be\nleft vacant. Though some exceptions were made, Superintendent Eric\nSmith testified that CMS generally adhered to the policy. See J.A.\nXV-7217.\n\nThe district court appropriately examined the magnet schools\nthrough a pre-unitary status lens, observing \"that the current litigation\n\n                   112\n\fstarted not as a petition for unitary status but as a discrimination suit\narising out of Christina Capacchione's denial of admission to a mag-\nnet school based on her race.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 284.\nThe district court recognized that school officials acting pursuant to\na desegregation order are immune from liability for actions taken con-\nsistent with that order. See Fowler v. Alexander, 478 F.2d 694, 696\n(4th Cir. 1973) (law enforcement officials who confined the plaintiff\npursuant to a court order were immune from § 1983 suit); see also\nWolfe v. City of Pittsburgh, 140 F.3d 236, 240 (3d Cir. 1998) (offi-\ncials acting pursuant to court order establishing quotas for promotions\nare not subject to § 1983 liability); Turney v. O'Toole, 898 F.2d 1470,\n1472-73 (10th Cir. 1990) (holding that so long as a court order is\nfacially valid, officials acting pursuant to that order are immune from\na damages suit); Coverdell v. Department of Soc. & Health Servs.,\n834 F.2d 758, 764 (9th Cir. 1987) (social worker is immune from\n§ 1983 liability when executing a facially valid court order). How-\never, the district court concluded that the use of magnet schools had\nnever been approved and that the rigid racial quotas of the magnet\nadmissions policy were \"beyond the scope of the Court's mandate.\"\nCapacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 285. The district court then subjected\nthe admissions policy to strict scrutiny, holding that the policy vio-\nlated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause it was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state\ninterest of remedying past discrimination. I would affirm.\n\nA. Immunity\n\nI begin with the question of whether the CMS officials are entitled\nto immunity because their actions in adopting and implementing the\nStolee magnet program in 1992 were taken pursuant to and were con-\nsistent with the desegregation orders and opinions issued by the dis-\ntrict court and Supreme Court in the early 1970s. CMS asserts that it\nis entitled to immunity for its act of implementing the 1992 magnet\nschools program without court approval because the prior desegrega-\ntion orders authorized the use of \"optional schools\" and a racial bal-\nance goal for filling them. Like the district court, I conclude that the\nmagnet schools plan, as implemented, was not authorized by the prior\ncourt orders and that, for the reasons stated hereafter, the CMS offi-\ncials are not entitled to immunity.\n\n                  113\n\fIn 1970, the district court issued a desegregation order to CMS,\nnoting that the order was \"not based upon any requirement of `racial\nbalance.'\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 267 (emphasis added). The court\nreiterated \"that efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the\nvarious schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one\nschool is racially different from the others, but [recognized] that vari-\nations from the norm may be unavoidable.\" Id. at 267-68 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The district court also gave CMS wide dis-\ncretion in implementing the desegregation measures by \"encourag-\n[ing] [CMS officials] to use their full`know-how' and resources to\nattain\" the desired results. Id. at 269. However, the district court con-\ncurrently warned that this \"maximum discretion . . . to choose meth-\nods that will accomplish the required result\" was not limitless,\ndirecting the board to obtain leave of court \"before making any mate-\nrial departure from any specific requirement set out\" in the order. Id.\nat 270. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the district court's\ndecision and also addressed the subject of racial quotas. See Swann,\n402 U.S. at 23-25. Specifically, with regard to the district court's goal\nof achieving a racial balance of seventy-one percent white and\ntwenty-nine percent black, the Court took care to note that \"[t]he con-\nstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition\nof the school system as a whole\" and that had the district court \"re-\nquire[d], as a matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular\ndegree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be disap-\nproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24.\nThe goal was upheld, however, because the \"use made of mathemati-\ncal ratios was no more than a starting point in the process of shaping\na remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25.\n\nIn 1974, the district court approved new guidelines and policies\nadopted by the board, which included the use of \"optional schools.\"\nSwann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04. These optional schools placed more\n\"emphasis on open or traditional education than normally offered in\nconventional schools.\" J.A. XXXII-15,683. The optional schools' tra-\nditional programs \"offer[ed] an enriched and highly structured educa-\ntion,\" J.A. XXXII-15,732, whereas the open programs offered a\n\"student-centered\" environment that \"encouraged [students] to take\nresponsibility for their behavior and for their own learning.\" J.A.\nXXXII-15,733. The optional schools approved by the 1974 order\n\n                  114\n\fwere far from being as diverse and specialized as the magnet school\nprogram implemented in 1992. The program suggested by Dr. Stolee\noffered schools specializing in traditional and open educational meth-\nods and created specialized curriculum schools featuring the Montes-\nsori method; science, mathematics, and technology; foreign language\nimmersion; learning immersion programs for young children;\nenhanced education for academically gifted students; and communi-\ncation studies programs. See J.A. XXXII-15730-41. However, both\nthe optional schools and the magnet schools were designed to achieve\nthe same end result--to attract students to a school in a particular\nlocation by using a specialized curriculum or teaching technique.\nThus, Dr. Stolee, in recommending the magnet program in 1992,\nobserved that CMS, via its optional schools, \"had some experience in\nsuch specialized schools.\" J.A. XXXII-15,580.\n\nConsistent with the district court's 1971 ruling that a flexible goal\nbe set for individual schools, the district court also approved an\noptional schools admissions policy which provided that \"optional\nschool enrollments will be controlled starting with 1974 so that they\nare open to all county residents and have about or above 20% black\nstudents,\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104, and recognized that the \"ac-\ntual enrollment of the optional school may have to be guided by its\nracial composition and by the number drawn from each other school\narea, not by considerations of space and program only,\" id. at 1108.\nAdditionally, the policy directed that \"[r]eassignments to optional\nschools must not jeopardize the racial composition of any other\nschool.\" Id. These modifications, however, at no time set a racial\nquota or ratio of the type disapproved of by the district court in its\nearlier orders and by the Supreme Court in its 1971 review of the dis-\ntrict court's 1970 order.99\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the Supreme Court's\ndisapproval of inflexible racial quotas as a desegregation tool is solely\na limitation on a district court's remedial power, and that school authori-\nties may impose such rigid racial quotas to remedy the identical wrong.\nIn Swann, the Court addressed the authority of the district court to\nimpose rigid racial quotas, but did not explicitly address the issue of\nwhether school authorities could do so. Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25. The\nsame day, however, the Court struck down a state anti-busing law\nbecause it \"flatly forb[ade] assignment of any student on account of race\n\n                  115\n\fFinally, despite the district court's 1970 directive that CMS obtain\ncourt approval for material modifications to the court-imposed deseg-\nregation plan, the approval process that took place in the ensuing\nyears, and Dr. Stolee's specific recommendation that CMS seek court\napproval for the new magnet schools program in 1992, CMS inexpli-\ncably chose not to return to the district court to obtain approval of the\nmagnet schools program and its strict admissions process. Conse-\nquently, the district court was never given the opportunity to rule\nupon its permissibility as a desegregation tool prior to its implementa-\ntion and CMS was never required by court order to implement it.\n\nNevertheless, I recognize that magnet schools are frequently used\nby school districts under a desegregation order. See Milliken v. Brad-\nley, 433 U.S. 267, 272 (1977) (Milliken II) (approving of magnet\nschools as a desegregation tool). Indeed, the plaintiff-intervenors'\nown expert has touted magnet programs as an \"effective way to attract\nsizable numbers of white students to predominately minority\nschools.\" David J. Armor, Forced Justice: School Desegregation and\nthe Law 223 (1995). Thus, a magnet schools program, properly imple-\nmented, can no doubt be an effective desegregation tool. However, a\nconclusion that CMS was free to adopt any form of magnet school\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nor for the purpose of creating a racial balance or ratio in the schools.\"\nNorth Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45 (1971).\nThis time addressing race-based assignments as a tool available to\n\"school authorities . . . to fulfill[ ] their constitutional obligation to elimi-\nnate existing dual school systems,\" the Court reiterated Swann's distinc-\ntion between unacceptable rigid quotas and acceptable quotas used as\n\"starting points in shaping a remedy.\" Id. at 46.\n\nCommon sense likewise compels me to reject the view that Swann for-\nbids courts to impose inflexible quotas, but sanctions the identical action\nby school authorities. Under such a reading of Swann, school authorities\nwould be at liberty to implement programs to remedy the effects of seg-\nregation which the district court would be prohibited from ordering for\nthe identical remedial purpose. However, whether imposed by a court\nupon a recalcitrant school board or voluntarily adopted by a school board\nto meet the requirements of Brown and Green, the constitutional implica-\ntions are the same. Even when intended to serve a permissible remedial\npurpose, unduly rigid race-based assignments exceed permissible limits\nof race-based remedial action.\n\n                   116\n\fprogram it might wish to see in place does not flow from this general\nproposition.\n\nNor do I find authorization for CMS's actions in the language of\nthe prior court orders which CMS points to for support of its immu-\nnity argument. At most, the portions of the district court order autho-\nrizing \"optional schools\" could perhaps be read in isolation as\nauthorizing CMS's use of \"magnet schools\" in more diverse, special-\nized areas, although I would still have difficulty excusing CMS's fail-\nure to seek the requisite prior court approval for such a material\nexpansion. I need not resolve this closer question, however, because\nCMS's program went much further than simply expanding the num-\nber and types of specialized schools, be they called \"optional\" or\n\"magnet.\" Under no circumstances could I accept CMS's assertion\nthat the inflexible racial quotas mandated by the expanded magnet\nschool program was countenanced by the prior court orders. The\noptional school order, relied on by CMS, required school officials to\nstrive for a minimum level of twenty percent black enrollment in\noptional schools. The same order required CMS to ensure that\noptional schools did not jeopardize the desegregation of other schools.\nBut the prior orders did not approve a use of race to the extent that\nCMS could deny eager applicants an otherwise available slot in a\nmagnet program solely on account of the applicant's race. On the con-\ntrary, both the district court and the Supreme Court in this very case\nconsistently rejected the use of such rigid racial quotas.\n\nI also find no authorization for the board's adoption of the magnet\nschools program in the Supreme Court's 1971 approval in Swann of\na majority-to-minority transfer policy that would prevent, for exam-\nple, an African-American child in a majority white school from trans-\nferring to a majority black school because the transfer would increase\nthe degree of segregation in the affected schools. See Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 26. Because the majority-to-minority transfer policy, like the mag-\nnet admissions policy, prevents a child from enrolling in the public\nschool of his choice, the majority concludes that the magnet admis-\nsions policy is permissible. By definition, however, CMS's special-\nized magnet programs are not tantamount to conventional public\nschools. While a child denied a transfer from one conventional school\nto another still receives the same general education, a child denied\nadmission to a specialized magnet program does not receive a similar\n\n                  117\n\fbenefit in a conventional school. In other words, an education in a\nmagnet school offering, for example, foreign language immersion, is\nnot interchangeable with an education in a conventional public school.10\n                                                                       10\nHence, the effect of the magnet admissions policy is far different from\nthe majority-to-minority transfer policy.\n\nThe end result of the challenged magnet schools admissions policy\nis placement of racial quotas ahead of educating students--an inap-\npropriate result nowhere countenanced in the district court's orders or\nin the Supreme Court's desegregation decisions. Cf. Wright v. Council\nof the City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 463 (1972) (holding that courts\nshould not approve a desegregation plan if the plan offers \"`quality\neducation' to some children, [but] has a substantial adverse effect\nupon the quality of education available to others\"). In fact, Brown I\nstruck down segregated schooling because children were denied equal\neducational opportunities. See Brown I, 347 U.S. at 493. While school\nboards were permitted to use race in assigning students in order to\nconvert to a unitary system, see North Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v.\nSwann, 402 U.S. 43, 46 (1971) (holding that the use of race in pupil\nassignments is \"one tool absolutely essential to fulfillment of [a\nschool board's] constitutional obligation to eliminate existing dual\nschool systems\"), the Brown opinions never contemplated that this\nremedial use of race, like the old dual system, would deny some stu-\ndents educational opportunities solely because of their race. See\nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 493 (holding that an educational opportunity\nprovided by the state \"must be made available to all on equal terms\");\nsee also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 305 (Powell, J.) (\"When a classification\ndenies an individual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely\nbecause of his race or ethnic background, it must be regarded as sus-\npect.\").11\n        11 In my view, an admissions policy that would deny an avail-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 I recognize that parents might perceive that one \"fungible\" conven-\ntional school is superior to another because of a number of intangibles\nsuch as the reputation of teachers or the newness of facilities. However,\nthese \"personal preferences\" do not rise to a level of constitutional signif-\nicance. See Hampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F. Supp. 2d\n358, 380 n.43 (W.D. Ky. 2000). Magnet schools, on the other hand, are\na completely different animal and therefore the admissions process used\nmust be more closely scrutinized.\n\n11 Though the present case was brought on behalf of a white child\ndenied admission to a magnet school, the policy as written could have\n\n                  118\n\fable, unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child,\nwhether black or white, on account of the child's race cannot be\nsquared with the district court's orders or the Supreme Court's deseg-\nregation decisions. It is improper to attempt to establish equal protec-\ntion of the laws in the realm of public education by denying children\nan equal opportunity to compete for open, unclaimed slots in CMS's\nextraordinary magnet schools. I agree with the district court that the\npolicy is ultra vires and that CMS officials are not entitled to immu-\nnity.\n\nB. Equal Protection\n\nHaving determined that the CMS officials are not entitled to immu-\nnity for the implementation of the strict race-based magnet school\nassignment policy, I now turn to the question of whether the officials'\nact of implementing the policy without prior court approval, albeit\nwhile under an order to desegregate schools, runs afoul of the Equal\nProtection clause. I conclude that it does.\n\nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment, \"[n]o State shall . . . deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, § 1. By guaranteeing equal protection, the\nAmendment recognizes that \"[d]istinctions between citizens solely\nbecause of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free peo-\nple whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\"\nHirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 100 (1943). The Supreme\nCourt has refused to make exceptions for so-called \"benign\" racial\nclassifications, see Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200,\n227 (1995), and the Court has made clear that \"all racial classifica-\ntions, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor,\nmust be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny,\" id.1212\n_________________________________________________________________\n\njust as easily denied a black child admission to the magnet school. See\nHampton v. Jefferson County Bd. of Educ., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 377\n(W.D. Ky. 2000) (racial quota in a magnet school resulting in black stu-\ndents being denied admission even though the school was several hun-\ndred students below capacity).\n\n12 The Supreme Court's application of strict scrutiny has indeed been\nunwavering. In Adarand, the Court refused to apply a lesser standard of\n\n                  119\n\fTo survive strict scrutiny, CMS's use of race in the magnet admis-\nsions program \"must (1) serve a compelling governmental interest and\n(2) be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.\" Tuttle v. Arlington\nCounty Sch. Bd., 195 F.3d 698, 704 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. dismissed,\n120 S. Ct. 1552 (2000). CMS avers that the magnet admissions policy\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nscrutiny to racial classifications enacted by Congress. Though Congress\nitself is charged with enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of\nequal protection via \"appropriate legislation,\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV,\n§ 5, the Supreme Court in interpreting the Fifth Amendment held Con-\ngress to the same rigorous standards applicable to states and localities.\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (observing \"that any person, of whatever\nrace, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the\nConstitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to\nunequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny\").\n\nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that strict scrutiny does not\napply when a school district is under court order to dismantle the dual\nsystem. Such an approach, however, ignores two of the three pillars of\nSupreme Court's equal protection analysis: skepticism of all racial pref-\nerences and consistent application of heightened scrutiny regardless of\nthe race of the person burdened or benefitted. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n223-24. Contrary to the assertions of CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, the\napproach I would adopt does not deprive a school board under court\norder of the necessary tools required to establish a unitary schools sys-\ntem.\n\n        The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the gov-\n        ernment in support of a racial classification, and the evidence\n        offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to\n        distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in govern-\n        mental decisionmaking. . . . Strict scrutiny does not \"trea[t] dis-\n        similar race-based decisions as though they were equally\n        objectionable\"; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all govern-\n        mental race-based decisions in order to decide which are consti-\n        tutionally objectionable and which are not.\n\nId. at 228 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). This careful\nevaluation demanded by the Supreme Court will preserve inviolate\nproper desegregation remedies while ensuring that in the process of\ndesegregating a government actor does not stand equal protection on its\nhead by denying some students educational opportunities solely because\nof their race.\n\n                   120\n\fwas adopted to remedy the effects of the dual school system previ-\nously operated in Mecklenburg County. Without question, remedying\nthe effects of past discrimination is a compelling state interest. See\nCity of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989).\n\nIn reviewing whether a policy is narrowly tailored to serve a com-\npelling state interest, a court considers factors such as:\n\n        (1) the necessity of the policy and the efficacy of alternative\n        race neutral policies;\n\n        (2) the planned duration of the policy;\n\n        (3) the relationship between the numerical goal and the per-\n        centage of minority group members in the relevant popula-\n        tion;\n\n        (4) the flexibility of the policy, including the provision of\n        waivers if the goal cannot be met; and\n\n        (5) the burden of the policy on innocent third parties.\n\nSee United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 171 (1987) (plurality\nopinion). Like the district court, I would conclude that the CMS mag-\nnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored.\n\nFirst, the magnet admissions policy was not necessary to comply\nwith the court's order to dismantle the dual educational system. CMS\nhad a number of options available to it that would not have deprived\nchildren, solely on account of their race, an available seat in a special-\nized magnet program. There is no evidence in the record that added\nflexibility or a waiver provision would have undermined the use of\nmagnet schools as a desegregation technique. The evidence simply\ndoes not reveal that the magnet admissions policy used was the only\nefficacious option available to CMS.\n\nSecond, this circuit has emphasized that \"[t]he use of racial prefer-\nences must be limited so that they do not outlast their need; they may\nnot take on a life of their own.\" Hayes v. North State Law Enforce-\n\n                   121\n\fment Ass'n, 10 F.3d 207, 216 (4th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Like the district court, I can find \"no mention of the\nduration that CMS would use racially segregated lotteries, vacancies,\nand waiting lists.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. In light of\nCMS's desire to remain under court order for the indefinite future, see\nsupra Part II.H, the lack of a duration for the magnet admissions pol-\nicy is not surprising. CMS was apparently content to leave available\nmagnet seats empty, despite the waiting lists, for years to come.\n\nThird, I agree with the district court that \"the 60-40 numerical goal\nis related to the relevant population, i.e., the racial composition of\nschoolchildren in CMS.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. How-\never, there is no evidence that CMS considered the \"practicability of\nachieving this precise ratio in every magnet school,\" id. at 290, or the\nvery real danger that magnet schools would be underutilized because\nseats would be left open despite an abundance of applicants. The\nresult of the admissions policy is but another indication that the CMS\nadministration, in the words of former Superintendent Murphy, \"was\nmore focused on balance than on [educational] outcomes.\" J.A. VI-\n2687.\n\nFourth, the district court aptly described the inflexibility in the\nmagnet admissions policy: \"The Court is hard-pressed to find a more\nrestrictive means of using race than a process that results in holding\nseats vacant while long waiting lists full of eager applicants are virtu-\nally ignored.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. The policy is\nindeed \"restrictive,\" but it also borders on obduracy. The policy con-\ntained no written waiver provision which, once again, shows a lack\nof concern that these highly specialized schools could and would be\nunderutilized.\n\nFinally, the innocent parties affected are children denied magnet\nslots solely because of their race and parents who \"must wait for\nmonths without knowing where their children eventually will be\nplaced.\" Id. at 290. A child's education is one of the greatest concerns\nof the family, and CMS unnecessarily causes much agonizing when\nit places children of the \"wrong color\" on waiting lists while it\nactively recruits children of the \"right color\" to fill empty magnet\nschool seats.\n\n                   122\n\fIn sum, the magnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored. The\npolicy is not necessary to dismantle the de jure system, is for an\nunlimited duration, provides for virtually no flexibility, and burdens\ninnocent children and their families. The inequities of CMS's magnet\nadmissions policy call to mind why strict scrutiny is used in the first\nplace: \"Of all the criteria by which men and women can be judged,\nthe most pernicious is that of race.\" Maryland Troopers Ass'n v.\nEvans, 993 F.2d 1072, 1076 (4th Cir. 1993). Teaching young children\nthat admission to a specialized academic program with available seats\nis contingent on their race is indeed pernicious, and CMS's magnet\nadmissions policy can in no way be described as narrowly tailored to\nachieve the compelling interest of remedying past discrimination.1313\n\nC. Award of Nominal Damages\n\nAfter finding a constitutional violation in the magnet schools, the\ndistrict court held CMS \"nominally liable in the amount of one dol-\nlar.\" Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 290. CMS argues that the nomi-\nnal damages awarded were unjustified because the actions resulting\nin a constitutional violation were taken in good faith. CMS fears that\nthe damages award will \"open the door to numerous suits by other\nstudents who could claim that they did suffer actual damages and\nargue that collateral estoppel prevents CMS from denying liability.\"\nDefendants-Appellants' Brief at 24. Regarding nominal damages, the\nSupreme Court has observed:\n\n        Common-law courts traditionally have vindicated depriva-\n        tions of certain \"absolute\" rights that are not shown to have\n        caused actual injury through the award of a nominal sum of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 CMS also presented diversity as an alternative compelling state inter-\nest. See Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d at 289. In this circuit, it is unsettled\nwhether diversity may be a compelling state interest. See Eisenberg v.\nMontgomery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130 (4th Cir. 1999), cert.\ndenied, 120 S. Ct. 1420 (2000). Assuming without deciding whether\ndiversity may be a compelling state interest, I would hold that the magnet\nadmissions policy again fails because it is not narrowly tailored. Whether\nthe interest is remedying past discrimination or diversity, the admissions\npolicy as currently written is in no sense narrow. It is difficult to imagine\nany interest for which the magnet admissions policy is narrowly tailored.\n\n                   123\n\f        money. By making the deprivation of such rights actionable\n        for nominal damages without proof of actual injury, the law\n        recognizes the importance to organized society that those\n        rights be scrupulously observed; but at the same time, it\n        remains true to the principle that substantial damages should\n        be awarded only to compensate actual injury or, in the case\n        of exemplary or punitive damages, to deter or punish mali-\n        cious deprivations of rights.\n\nCarey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978) (nominal damages avail-\nable for denial of procedural due process rights) (footnote omitted);\nsee also Price v. City of Charlotte, 93 F.3d 1241, 1246 (4th Cir. 1996)\n(stating that \"the rationale for the award of nominal damages being\nthat federal courts should provide some marginal vindication for a\nconstitutional violation\"). In the present case there was indeed a con-\nstitutional violation. CMS ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause\nwhen it adopted a magnet school admissions policy designed to deny\nan available, unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child\non account of the child's race. In order to recover nominal damages,\nChristina Capacchione need not prove that absent the unconstitutional\npolicy she would have been admitted to the magnet program. The\ninjury in the present case is not the ultimate inability to enroll in the\nmagnet school, but the inability to compete for open, unclaimed seats\non an equal basis. See Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666\n(1993). Though the two open \"black seats\" at the Olde Providence\nmagnet school were eventually awarded to white children, the fact\nremains that the official magnet admissions policy prohibited children\nlike Christina from competing for the open slots. In fact, CMS left the\ntwo available \"black seats\" at Olde Providence unfilled for most of\nthe summer while Christina and over one hundred other white chil-\ndren languished on a waiting list. The nominal award in this case rec-\nognizes the importance of equal protection under the law and provides\nsome measure of vindication. As for CMS's worry about collateral\nestoppel, liability has already been established, and vacating the nom-\ninal damages would not change this. In sum, I would hold that the dis-\ntrict court did not err in awarding nominal damages.\n\nIV. Injunctive Relief\n\nAfter recounting the unitary status determination and the constitu-\ntional violation in the magnet admissions policy, the district court\n\n                   124\n\fenjoined \"CMS from any further use of race-based lotteries, prefer-\nences, and set-asides in student assignment.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 292. CMS challenges the district court's injunction as\nunwarranted and overbroad.\n\nBefore a court grants a permanent injunction, the court must first\nfind necessity--a danger of future violations. See Connecticut v. Mas-\nsachusetts, 282 U.S. 660, 674 (1931) (stating that an injunction \"will\nnot be granted against something merely feared as liable to occur at\nsome indefinite time in the future\"); United States v. Oregon State\nMed. Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952) (\"All it takes to make the cause\nof action for relief by injunction is a real threat of future violation or\na contemporary violation of a nature likely to continue or to recur.\");\nBloodgood v. Garraghty, 783 F.2d 470, 475 (4th Cir. 1986) (\"An\ninjunction is a drastic remedy and will not issue unless there is an\nimminent threat of illegal action.\"). Though a flexible tool, an injunc-\ntion may not be used for \"punishment or reparations for . . . past vio-\nlations.\" Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. at 333.\n\nThe district court's finding of a threat of future violations centered\non CMS's offering of diversity as a compelling state interest. This\ninterest was offered after the district court decided that the admissions\npolicy should be reviewed using strict scrutiny. Because in this circuit\nit is unsettled whether diversity may be a compelling state interest,\nsee Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Schs., 197 F.3d 123, 130\n(4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1420 (2000), it was improper\nfor the district court to base its injunction on CMS's unsuccessful\ndefense of the policy. At this point, I can discern nothing in the record\nindicating that CMS will ignore the district court order and continue\nto use race in an unconstitutional manner in the operation of the mag-\nnet schools or other schools in the system. CMS represented to the\ndistrict court both during and after trial that it had no intention of con-\ntinuing the magnet plan. In moving for a stay of the injunction, CMS\ndid not ask that the injunction be stayed as to the magnet schools, and\nwas prepared to comply immediately with the court's order. CMS\nrequested a stay as to the non-magnet schools because over 50,000\nstudents were likely to be reassigned in a short period of time. More-\nover, there was no evidence presented at trial about what CMS pro-\nposed to do as a unitary school system. A post-unitary status student\nassignment plan was never given to the district court, and the evi-\n\n                  125\n\fdence simply does not indicate that \"there is an imminent threat of\nillegal action.\" Bloodgood, 783 F.2d at 475. Hence, I agree with the\nultimate conclusion of the majority that the district court erred in\ngranting injunctive relief.\n\nV. Discovery Sanctions\n\nThe district court sanctioned CMS for failing to supplement its\nanswers to interrogatories that sought a list of witnesses. We review\nthe district court's management of discovery under the abuse of dis-\ncretion standard. See Anderson v. Foundation for Advancement, Educ.\n& Employment of Am. Indians, 155 F.3d 500, 504 (4th Cir. 1998).\nThe record reveals that no list of fact witnesses was presented to the\nplaintiff-intervenors until five days before the trial date. At that time,\nCMS presented a list of 174 witness, which was later cut to twenty-\nsix. The plaintiff-intervenors moved for sanctions and the court\ngranted the motion in part. The court had to continue the trial for one\nweek so that the plaintiff-intervenors could depose the newly dis-\nclosed witnesses, and the court held CMS accountable for the fees and\nexpenses of these depositions.\n\nWe have developed a four-part test for a district court to use when\ndetermining what sanctions to impose under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 37. Specifically, \"[t]he court must determine (1) whether\nthe non-complying party acted in bad faith, (2) the amount of preju-\ndice that noncompliance caused the adversary, (3) the need for deter-\nrence of the particular sort of non-compliance, and (4) whether less\ndrastic sanctions would have been effective.\" Id. An examination of\nthe four factors reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court.\n\nFirst, there is ample evidence of bad faith. Early in the case, the\nplaintiff-intervenors presented CMS with an interrogatory asking for\ndisclosure of trial witnesses. In response to the interrogatory, CMS\nstated that it would provide appropriate information concerning wit-\nnesses at the time and in the manner specified by the district court.\nThe plaintiff-intervenors moved to compel discovery, and the court\nagreed with CMS that the request was premature. However, the court\ninstructed CMS to \"supplement its responses [to the interrogatories],\nas it promised, when such information becomes known.\" J.A. I-195.\nAs an excuse for its untimely disclosure of fact witnesses, CMS relies\n\n                  126\n\fon the court's pre-trial order, which provides that \"[a] witness list\ncontaining the name of every proposed witness\" should be filed with\nthe court on the first day of trial. J.A. I-150. This provision of the pre-\ntrial order was clearly for the court's convenience and could not rea-\nsonably be interpreted to apply to disclosures to the other parties.\nBesides, even if such an interpretation were reasonable, the court's\ncommand to supplement interrogatories superceded the pre-trial\norder. Accordingly, bad faith is evident.\n\nSecond, the presentation of such a lengthy witness list on the eve\nof trial to the plaintiff-intervenors was prejudicial. Without the action\nof the court, the plaintiff-intervenors would have had no opportunity\nto depose the witnesses, much less properly prepare for trial. Thus,\nCMS's failure to supplement interrogatories was prejudicial.\n\nThird, such non-compliance with the district court's orders cer-\ntainly needed to be deterred. The district court's condonation of\nCMS's bad faith at a time so close to the beginning of trial could have\nencouraged repetition of improper conduct. As found by the district\ncourt, the record indicates that the failure to supplement interrogato-\nries was not the first time CMS \"was lacking in candor in disclosing\nrelevant and important information.\" J.A. I-305. Hence, deterrence\nwas essential to a proper management of this case.\n\nFinally, less drastic sanctions would not have been effective. Per-\nmitting the plaintiff-intervenors to depose witnesses and requiring\nCMS to pay fees and expenses for the depositions was appropriate.\nCMS was fortunate to receive such a light sanction, and it is doubtful\nwhether lesser measures would have had any effect on CMS's con-\nduct.\n\nIn sum, I agree with the majority that the discovery sanctions\nimposed did not amount to an abuse of the district court's discretion.\n\nVI. Attorney Fees\n\nCMS argues that the district court erred in awarding Capacchione\nattorney fees because (1) Capacchione received only nominal dam-\nages, and (2) young Capacchione would not have been admitted to the\n\n                    127\n\fmagnet program even if race was not a factor insofar as her lottery\nnumber was so high.14 14 Under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988(b) (West. Supp.\n2000), \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of\n[§ 1983 and other civil rights laws] . . . the court, in its discretion,\nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reason-\nable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" To be considered a prevailing\nparty, a party must \"succeed on any significant issue in litigation\nwhich achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing\nsuit.\" Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 109 (1992) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In Farrar, the Supreme Court specifically addressed\nthe issue of nominal damages and prevailing party status:\n\n       We therefore hold that a plaintiff who wins nominal dam-\n       ages is a prevailing party under § 1988. . . . A plaintiff may\n       demand payment for nominal damages no less than he may\n       demand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory\n       damages. A judgment for damages in any amount, whether\n       compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant's behav-\n       ior for the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay\n       an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\n\nId. at 112-13 (internal citations omitted). The award of nominal dam-\nages constitutes relief on the merits and affects CMS's behavior\ntoward Capacchione if only by forcing CMS to pay. Hence, Capacch-\nione is a prevailing party. See also Shaw v. Hunt, 154 F.3d 161, 164\n(4th Cir. 1998) (noting that \"persons within the generic category of\nplaintiff-intervenors have often been found by courts to fit within the\nrubric `prevailing party' for fees purposes\"). That young Capacchione\nhad a high lottery number is irrelevant for a determination of prevail-\ning party status.\n\nI would also affirm the attorney fee award to the plaintiff-\nintervenors to the extent that it compensates them for their litigation\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14 CMS concedes that if unitary status is upheld, Grant is entitled to\nattorney fees. However, CMS takes a much different view of Capacch-\nione's actions insofar as Capacchione originally attacked only the mag-\nnet program and did not have sights set on unitary status. Nonetheless,\nthe record is clear that Capacchione actively participated with Grant in\nthe unitary status litigation.\n\n                  128\n\fof the unitary status issue. Monitoring of a school desegregation\ndecree is crucial to the dismantling of the dual system. See Jenkins v.\nMissouri, 967 F.2d 1248, 1251 (8th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, efforts\n\"to insure full compliance and to ensure that the plan is indeed work-\ning to desegregate the school system, are compensable services.\"\nNorthcross v. Board of Educ., 611 F.2d 624, 637 (6th Cir. 1979). The\nmajority correctly notes that \"success in reaching that last stage [in a\ndesegregation case] is often appropriately credited to the original\nplaintiffs who brought the case.\" Ante at 71. However, the unique\nposture of this case, with the school board and the original plaintiffs\nresisting the resumption of local control, dictates looking at the award\nof fees in a different light.\n\nThe plaintiff-intervenors, through their work in litigating unitary\nstatus, have stepped into the shoes of the original plaintiffs and\nbrought this case to what I believe should be its close. Based on their\nmonitoring of CMS's activities and a belief that the decree had\n\"work[ed] to desegregate the school system,\" Northcross, 611 F.2d at\n637, the plaintiff-intervenors petitioned for a declaration of unitary\nstatus. Though most of the vital information was in the hands of\nCMS's officials, who were often uncooperative in the discovery pro-\ncess, see Capacchione, 57 F. Supp. 2d. at 292-293 (cataloging sanc-\ntions and threats of sanctions against CMS), the plaintiff-intervenors\nhave in my view prevailed on the issue of unitary status. In this regard\nthe plaintiff-intervenors have acted as \"private attorney[s] general,\"\nIndependent Fed'n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754, 758-\n60 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original),\nand the exceptional circumstances of this case indicate that a fee is\nproper. To avoid a declaration of unitary status, CMS has clung to the\ndesegregation decree for improper reasons, see supra part II.H, and\nthe equitable remedy ordered in 1969 \"would be far from complete,\nand justice would not be attained, if reasonable counsel fees were not\nawarded\" to the plaintiff-intervenors. Bell v. School Bd. of Powhatan\nCounty, 321 F.2d 494, 500 (4th Cir. 1963) (awarding attorney fees in\nschool desegregation case based on exceptional circumstances); see\nalso Rolax v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 186 F.2d 473, 481 (4th Cir.\n1950). A contrary result would hamper the involvement of concerned\ncitizens in school desegregation litigation and permit school boards\nthat are inclined to remain under court order to eschew a unitary sta-\n\n                  129\n\ftus hearing. Accordingly, I would affirm the district court's award of\nattorney fees.\n\nVII.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court's grant\nof unitary status in toto. Additionally, I would affirm the finding of\na constitutional violation in the magnet school admissions policy, the\naward of nominal damages, and the attorney fees award. Lastly, I con-\ncur with the majority that the district court's injunction was unwar-\nranted and that the district court's discovery sanctions were not an\nabuse of discretion.\n\n                  130\n\f",

Brown v. Board\nof Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (1954) (\"Brown I\"). During the twenty\nyears following the Supreme Court's mandate, the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Board of Education (\"CMS\" or the\"Board\") resisted all\nefforts to expedite desegregation, essentially arguing that, in light of\nthe centuries over which the dual system of education had come to\nfruition, the Board would need a proportional period of time to\ndevelop remedies aimed at correcting past wrongs. Faced with this\nintransigence, the Supreme Court unanimously decided in 1971 that\nthe Constitution required the Board to take affirmative measures,\nincluding the use of race-based ratios in student assignment, to eradi-\ncate vestiges of its invidious discrimination. See Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).\n\nFinally, in 1975, the Board began seeking to fulfill the Supreme\nCourt's mandate that public schools be desegregated with \"all deliber-\nate speed.\" Brown v. Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (1955)\n(\"Brown II\"). Today, with the Board having had less than twenty-six\nyears to implement appropriate remedies, we must decide whether the\ntask of desegregating the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools has reached\nits end.\n\nWe hold that it has not. Over the Board's own admission to the\ncontrary, the district court concluded that the school system had\nachieved unitary status across the board. While the district court made\nfindings sufficient to hold that CMS had achieved unitary status in\nsome respects, the court failed to adequately explore the return of pre-\ndominantly one-race schools as a vestige of segregation, rendering its\nfindings insufficient to conclude that CMS has achieved unitary status\nin every respect.\n\nIn an equally unprecedented ruling, the district court held that the\nschool system, although operating under court orders to desegregate\n\n                  6\n\fits schools, violated the Constitution by employing a magnet school\nprogram that considered race in student assignment. On the contrary,\nbecause the Board's expanded magnet schools program -- and the\nrace-sensitive method of student selection it employed -- was\nundertaken both to remedy the effects of past segregation and to com-\nply with governing court orders, they did not and could not violate the\nConstitution.\n\nIn this appeal, we consider the above rulings along with a number\nof related issues. As explained below, we affirm in part, reverse in\npart, vacate in part, and remand this case for further proceedings.\n\nI.\n\nA.\n\nIn order to better understand the issues presented in this case, we\nmust briefly review our country's history of school desegregation liti-\ngation, in which CMS has played a prominent role.\n\nEven after slavery had been abolished for almost a full century,\nAfrican-American children were, for the most part, either excluded\nfrom the public schools or educated separately from white children.\n\"In fact, any education of Negroes was forbidden by law in some\nstates.\" Brown I, 347 U.S. at 490; see also Martin v.

Fergu-\nson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1896).\n\nIn the middle of the 1900s, the Supreme Court began dismantling\nthe great wall of segregation constructed under the imprimatur of\nPlessy. The Court initially sought to determine whether various \"sepa-\nrate\" African-American schools were genuinely \"equal\" to white\nschools by evaluating the quality of physical facilities, curricula, fac-\nulty, and certain \"intangible\" considerations. See, e.g., Sweatt v.\nPainter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104804\"><a href=\"/opinion/104804/sweatt-v-painter/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1950); Sipuel v.

In each instance, the Court concluded\nthat they were not. Id.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court at last overruled Plessy, declaring that\n\"in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal'\nhas no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\"\nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 495. Just one year later, the Court mandated that\nfederal courts and school authorities take affirmative steps to achieve\ndesegregation. Brown II, 349 U.S. at 299. Specifically, federal courts\nwere to retain jurisdiction over desegregation cases during the period\nof transition, wielding their equitable powers to supervise school\nboards' efforts to effectuate integration. Id. at 300-01. One of the\nmost important obligations of the federal courts was to ensure that\nschool boards were proceeding in good faith to desegregate the public\nschools \"with all deliberate speed.\" Id. at 301. With these seminal\ndecisions -- Brown I and Brown II-- the Supreme Court promised\nthe citizens of this country, and particularly African-American chil-\ndren, school systems \"in which all vestiges of enforced racial segrega-\ntion have been eliminated.\" Wright v. Council of the City of Emporia,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108587\"><a href=\"/opinion/108587/wright-v-council-of-emporia/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463 (1972).\n\nNotwithstanding the Court's repeated admonition that segregation\nand its vestiges be eliminated \"root and branch,\" Green v. County Sch.\nBd. of New Kent County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437-48 (1968), many school\nboards -- CMS included -- adopted \"an all too familiar\" response to\nthe mandate of Brown II, interpreting \"all deliberate speed\" \"as giving\nlatitude to delay steps to desegregate.\" Freeman v. Pitts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (1992). And so, lower federal courts, with the guidance and\noversight of the Supreme Court, began fashioning equitable remedies\nto contend with school board recalcitrance. For example, in Green,\nthe Supreme Court held that a \"freedom of choice\" plan, which per-\nmitted students -- regardless of race -- to choose the school they\nwould attend, was by itself insufficient to meet the mandate of Brown.\n391 U.S. at 430. In so holding, the Court recognized that more inten-\nsive efforts would be necessary in order to make \"meaningful and\nimmediate progress toward disestablishing state-imposed segrega-\ntion.\" Id. at 439. Subsequently, in this very case, the Court approved\nsignificant federal court intervention into a school system in order to\neliminate segregation \"root and branch,\" including the busing of stu-\ndents from schools close to their homes to schools farther away, the\n\n                  8\n\fuse of race-based \"mathematical ratios,\" and the alteration of student\nattendance zones. Swann, 402 U.S. at 15, 25, 28, 30-31.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made clear, however, that a federal court's\n\"end purpose must be to remedy the violation and, in addition, to\nrestore state and local authorities to the control of a school system that\nis operating in compliance with the Constitution.\" Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 489. Hence, as a school system eliminates the vestiges of past offi-\ncial segregation from certain facets of its operations, courts possess\nthe authority to relinquish supervision in a commensurate fashion. Id.\nat 489-91.\n\nIn this context, we examine the steps taken by CMS to eliminate\nthe vestiges of segregation.\n\nB.\n\n1.\n\nNorth Carolina's most significant initial response to the mandate of\nBrown II was the \"Pupil Assignment Act of 1955-56, under which\n[the Board had] the sole power to assign pupils to schools, and chil-\ndren [were] required to attend the schools to which they [were]\nassigned.\" Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 300 F.\nSupp. 1358, 1361 (W.D.N.C. 1969). This was an ineffectual measure\n-- perhaps intentionally so -- and by 1964, no more than a few dozen\n(out of more than 20,000) African-American children in CMS were\nattending schools with white children. Id. at 1362.\n\n2.\n\nIn 1965, the parents of African-American children attending CMS\n(hereinafter the \"Swann plaintiffs\")11 filed a class action seeking\ninjunctive relief, claiming that the Board's policies and practices were\nperpetuating a segregated school system.

But the linchpin of\nthis plan was its grant of permission to each student -- regardless of\nrace -- to freely transfer to a different school (often described as a\n\"freedom of choice\" plan). Id. In approving this plan, the district court\nheld that CMS had no affirmative duty to \"increase the mixing of the\nraces\"; instead, the Board's obligation under Brown II, according to\nthe court, was to act without the intent to perpetuate segregation. Id.\nat 670. The following year, this Court affirmed the district court's\ninterpretation of Brown II. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd.\nof Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"273807\"><a href=\"/opinion/273807/james-e-swann-and-edith-swann-minors-by-their-parents-and-next-friends/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (4th Cir. 1966) (\"Whatever the Board may\ndo in response to its own initiative or that of the community, we have\nheld that there is no constitutional requirement that it act with the con-\nscious purpose of achieving the maximum mixture of the races in the\nschool population.\").\n\nHowever, in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in\nGreen, which struck down a desegregation plan founded predomi-\nnantly on \"freedom of choice,\" it became clear that school boards did\npossess an affirmative obligation to desegregate, not merely an obli-\ngation to implement race-neutral policies. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\nInvigorated by the developing law, the Swann plaintiffs promptly\nfiled a motion for further relief with the district court, seeking to\nexpedite the desegregation process.\n\n3.\n\nIn 1969, Judge James B. McMillan, newly assigned to the Swann\ncase,2\n     2 reexamined the Board's actions in light of Green and deter-\nmined that its \"freedom of choice\" plan, when coupled with geo-\ngraphic zoning, were \"not furthering desegregation.\" 300 F. Supp. at\n1372. On the fundamental matters of assigning students and faculty,\nand the siting of new schools, the court made the following findings:\n\n- Student assignment: The court noted that a ratio of seventy percent\n        white students to thirty percent black students, which approxi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 For clarity's sake, we will often refer within to the presiding district\njudge by name.\n\n                  10\n\f       mated the ratio of white to black students in the county, tended to\n       aid \"better students [in holding] their pace, with substantial\n       improvement for the poorer students.\" Id. at 1369.\n\n- Faculty assignment: Although faculty members were not being\n        assigned with a discriminatory purpose, there was also \"no sus-\n        tained effort to desegregate faculties.\" Id. at 1370. The court\n        ordered CMS to work actively to integrate the faculties, so that \"a\n        child attending any school in the system will face about the same\n        chances of having a black or a white teacher as he would in any\n        other school.\" Id.\n\n- School siting: The court underscored that the desirability of imple-\n        menting a \"neighborhood school\" policy, under which efforts were\n        made to locate schools in neighborhoods and within walking dis-\n        tance for children, could not override the constitutional duty to\n        desegregate. Id. at 1369. At the same time, CMS was not to avoid\n        locating new facilities in black neighborhoods. Id. at 1371.\n\nIn light of Green, Judge McMillan also ordered CMS to submit a\nnew, amended desegregation plan, and he outlined certain possible\nremedies, including busing and re-zoning.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1794147\"><a href=\"/opinion/1794147/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Board's pro-\nposed desegregation plan, approved by the district court on an interim\nbasis (\"interim desegregation plan\"), included programs for faculty\ndesegregation, the closing of seven all-black schools, and the reas-\nsignment of pupils from the closed schools to outlying, predominantly\nwhite schools. Id. at 1298-99. In approving the plan on an interim\nbasis, the district court noted that black children were bearing a dis-\n\n                  11\n\fproportionate burden of the desegregation efforts, but the court none-\ntheless concluded that some action -- even if interim -- was\npreferable to none at all. Id. at 1298. Judge McMillan also ordered the\nBoard to submit another desegregation plan within three months.\n\nIn November and December 1969, the district court determined\nthat the school system's compliance with the interim desegregation\nplan was unsatisfactory, finding that the Board was continuing to per-\npetuate segregation:\n\n        The School Board is sharply divided in the expressed views\n        of its members. From the testimony of its members, and\n        from the latest report, it cannot be concluded that a majority\n        of its members have accepted the court's orders as repre-\n        senting the law which applies to the local schools. By the\n        responses to the October 10 questions, the Board has indi-\n        cated that its members do not accept the duty to desegregate\n        the schools at any ascertainable time; and they have clearly\n        indicated that they intend not to do it effective in the fall of\n        1970. They have also demonstrated a yawning gap between\n        predictions and performance.\n\nSwann, 306 F. Supp. at 1306. At that time, the district court also\nreviewed and rejected the Board's newly submitted amended desegre-\ngation plan. Id. at 1313-14. Then, the court appointed Dr. John A.\nFinger, Jr. as an expert consultant to prepare a more acceptable plan.\nThis appointment came nearly two years after the Supreme Court's\nGreen decision and more than fifteen years after Brown I.\n\nThe district court ultimately adopted Dr. Finger's proposed plan for\nelementary schools and the Board's plan, as modified by Dr. Finger,\nfor secondary schools (collectively the \"Finger Plan\").

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268-70\n(W.D.N.C. 1970). In doing so, the court again observed the Board's\nfailure to make an effective beginning to desegregation: \"The School\nBoard, after four opportunities and nearly ten months of time, have\nfailed to submit a lawful plan (one which desegregates all the\nschools). This default on their part leaves the court in the position of\nbeing forced to prepare or choose a lawful plan.\" Id. at 267.\n\n                  12\n\fThe Finger Plan included several components. First, students were\nto be assigned \"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various\nschools at various grade levels have about the same proportion of\nblack and white students.\" Id. at 268. Second, \"no school [could] be\noperated with an all-black or predominantly black student body.\" Id.\nThird, in redrawing the school system's attendance zones, the Board\nwas authorized to use bus transportation and noncontiguous \"satellite\nzones\"33 to accomplish its goals. Id. Fourth, the district court restricted\nthe student transfer policy in order to safeguard against resegregation.\nId. at 268-69. Fifth, the race of faculty members at each school had\nto approximate the ratio of black and white faculty members through-\nout the system. Id. at 268. Sixth, the overall competence of teachers\nat formerly black schools could not be inferior to those at formerly\nwhite schools. Id. Finally, the district court mandated that the Board\nmonitor and report on its progress in implementing the plan. Id. at\n269.\n\nThe Finger Plan was challenged on several occasions and, in 1971,\nthe Supreme Court upheld it as a valid exercise of the district court's\nequitable powers. Swann, 402 U.S. at 31-32. Indeed, the Court specif-\nically found that the district court's adoption of a student assignment\nplan that used race-based \"mathematical ratios\" as a starting point was\nwell within the court's \"equitable remedial discretion.\" Id. at 25.\n\nEven after the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, the district\ncourt found that the Board's desegregation efforts failed to meet con-\nstitutional requirements. For example, Judge McMillan ordered stu-\ndent assignment proposals revised in June 1971, finding that the\nproposals \"were discriminatory in detail and in overall result; they\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 CMS used \"satellite zones\" in connection with elementary schools.\nUnder this method, students from a small geographic area located outside\nan elementary school's primary attendance area were assigned to that\nschool. J.A. 15571, 16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9 & n.3. The use\nof satellite zones was implemented by \"pairing\" elementary schools --\nstudents from a predominantly black neighborhood were bused to a\nschool in a predominantly white neighborhood for grades K-3, and stu-\ndents from a predominantly white neighborhood were bused to a school\nin a predominantly black neighborhood for grades 4-6. J.A. 15571,\n16052; see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 9-10.\n\n                  13\n\fplaced increasing burdens upon black patrons while partially relieving\nwhite patrons of similar burdens.\" Swann v.

In that order, Judge McMillan\napproved a student assignment proposal that, if implemented prop-\nerly, would result in \"a fair and stable school operation\" and would\npermit the court to close the case as an active matter. See 379 F. Supp.\nat 1103. The proposal made provisions for several \"optional schools\"\n-- schools that would offer some specialized program or curriculum\nand thereby attract students of all races from across Charlotte and\nMecklenburg County. Although Judge McMillan approved the incor-\nporation of these schools into the plan, he cautioned that the optional\nschools would be inconsistent with the school board's constitutional\nobligations if they merely served to re-institute \"freedom of choice.\"\nId. at 1104 (\"`Freedom of choice' was a synonym for segregation for\nmany years, and . . . it should not be resurrected at this late date sub\nnom. `optional schools' without adequate safeguards against discrimi-\nnatory results.\"). To ensure that the optional schools served their\nstated purpose of furthering the process of desegregation, Judge\nMcMillan decreed that \"optional school enrollments will be con-\ntrolled starting with 1974 so that they . . . have about or above 20%\nblack students.\" Id.\n\nFinally, in July 1975, over twenty years after the mandate of Brown\nII, Judge McMillan for the first time observed, albeit with reserva-\ntions, that the Board was actually working toward desegregation:\n\"The new Board has taken a more positive attitude toward desegrega-\ntion and has at last openly supported affirmative action to cope with\nrecurrent racial problems in pupil assignment.\" Swann v.

Supp. at 1321. The Swann plain-\ntiffs intervened in Martin, joining the Board's opposition to the con-\ntentions of the Martin plaintiffs. Id.\n\nA brief review of Spangler and Bakke is necessary to an under-\nstanding of Martin. In Spangler, the Supreme Court held that because\nthe Pasadena Unified School District (\"PUSD\") had achieved racial\nneutrality in its school attendance pattern, \"the District Court was not\nentitled to require the PUSD to rearrange its attendance zones each\nyear so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by the court was main-\ntained in perpetuity.\" 427 U.S. at 436. All parties in Spangler agreed\nthat the plan initially achieved racial neutrality in student attendance;\nnonetheless, the district court had believed it was empowered to annu-\nally readjust school boundaries to ensure in perpetuity that there\nwould be no majority of any minority race at any Pasadena school.\nId. at 433, 436. In Bakke, the Supreme Court determined that a public\nuniversity with no history of discrimination could not constitutionally\n\n                  15\n\freserve sixteen out of one hundred admission slots for racial minori-\nties. 438 U.S. at 319-20. In striking down this admissions plan, the\nCourt had made clear that \"[w]hen a classification denies an individ-\nual opportunities or benefits enjoyed by others solely because of his\nrace or ethnic background, [it must] be regarded as [constitutionally]\nsuspect.\" Id. at 305.\n\nJudge McMillan, who retained jurisdiction over Swann and pre-\nsided over Martin, first held that because CMS had not achieved\nracial neutrality in student attendance, consideration of race in student\nassignment policies was appropriate under Swann . See Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380773\"><a href=\"/opinion/380773/george-martin-for-himself-and-in-behalf-of-his-minor-children-ellen-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1980).\nHe explained that because the student assignment policy in the CMS\nschool system had been independently adopted by the Board, it was\nnot established, as the Spangler policy had been, via judicial coercion\nor order. 475 F. Supp. at 1340-43. Second, Judge McMillan ruled that\nBakke was inapposite to the claims of the Martin plaintiffs. Specifi-\ncally, the court reasoned that no child was being denied access to\nequal educational opportunity because of race, see id. at 1321, and the\nactions of the Board were therefore not constitutionally suspect under\nBakke.\n\nIn upholding the independent actions of the Board, Judge McMil-\nlan made several important findings. For example, he found that dis-\ncrimination had not ended; indeed, it was this very finding that led the\ncourt to uphold the 1978 race-conscious student assignment policy.\nId. at 1346-47. Also, although for the first time the district court\npraised the efforts of the Board without reservation, it underscored yet\nagain the need for patience and continued efforts:\n\n       It took three centuries to develop a slave culture, to fight a\n       bloody civil war, and to live through the century of racial\n       turmoil after that war.\n\n***\n\n       The culture and attitudes and results of three centuries of\n       segregation cannot be eliminated nor corrected in ten years.\n       Human nature and practices don't change that fast, even in\n       the hands of people of good will like the members of the\n\n                  16\n\f        present School Board. They need time to work their own\n        experiments, and to find their own ways of producing the\n        sustained operation of a system of schools in which racial\n        discrimination will play no part. I vote to uphold their\n        efforts to date, and to give them that time.\n\nId. at 1347. In 1980, we affirmed the district court's decision in Mar-\ntin. See 626 F.2d at 1165.\n\nb.\n\nThe second significant phase of litigation between 1975 and 1992\nwas initiated in 1980. At that time, CMS and the Swann plaintiffs\nnotified the district court that the black student population in CMS\nelementary schools had grown from twenty-nine percent to forty per-\ncent, making it increasingly difficult to comply with the desegregation\norder's mandate to avoid majority-black elementary schools. In\nresponse to this change, Judge McMillan approved a modification to\nthe desegregation plan. Instead of prohibiting a \"predominantly black\nstudent body,\" the court permitted CMS to operate elementary\nschools with a black student population of \"plus 15 percent\" above\nthe district-wide average. Thus, if the school district averaged forty\npercent black students, any individual school could have fifty-five\npercent black students.\n\n5.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1992, the Board continued to operate its desegrega-\ntion plan as approved by the district court, focusing, inter alia, on sat-\nellite attendance zones, a feeder plan (assigning middle-school\nstudents from a certain neighborhood to identified high schools),\nschool closings, and construction of new schools. Then, in 1992,\nCMS substantially increased its reliance on \"optional\" or magnet\nschools (the \"expanded magnet schools program\"). The Board placed\nnew emphasis on magnet schools in order to phase out\"pairing\" and\nheavy reliance on busing, and to give parents more choice in school\nselection. It was the expanded magnet schools program that ultimately\nled to the present phase of this litigation.\n\n                   17\n\f6.\n\nIn September 1997, William Capacchione, individually and on\nbehalf of his daughter Christina, sued CMS claiming that Christina\nwas unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school. Chris-\ntina is Hispanic and Caucasian, and her suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\nsought declaratory, injunctive, and compensatory relief. In response,\nCMS moved to dismiss Capacchione's suit and, almost simulta-\nneously, the Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann, claiming\nthat CMS was not yet in compliance with past desegregation orders\nand had not yet achieved unitary status. Because Judge McMillan had\ndied, the cases were assigned to Senior Judge Robert D. Potter, who\nrestored Swann to the district court's docket, consolidated the cases,\ndenied CMS's motion to dismiss, and granted Capacchione's motion\nto intervene.44\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs claimed that CMS had long since elim-\ninated the vestiges of segregation in its schools, and that its formerly\ndual system of white and black schools had, for some time, been uni-\ntary. They also contended that CMS, while still operating under the\ncourt's desegregation orders, had violated those orders and the consti-\ntutional rights of white students in its efforts to desegregate the school\nsystem by employing a race-conscious assignment lottery in its\nexpanded magnet schools program. The Swann plaintiffs countered\nthat the school system had not yet achieved unitary status. CMS\nacknowledged that it was not yet in compliance with past desegrega-\ntion orders and agreed that it should not be declared to have achieved\nunitary status. CMS also contended that, in any event, the expanded\nmagnet schools program constituted an entirely constitutional and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 Since filing suit, the Capacchiones have moved to California. Based\non that fact and other findings, the district court determined that William\nCapacchione no longer possessed standing to seek injunctive or declara-\ntory relief, but that he did have standing to pursue compensatory relief.\nCapacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416911/capacchione-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Another group of white parents intervened in the con-\nsolidated action and that group, represented by plaintiff Michael Grant,\nclaimed that CMS has achieved unitary status.

The Swann plaintiffs, while endorsing the concept of\nmagnet schools, argued that the expanded magnet schools program,\nas implemented, was contributing to the resegregation of the school\nsystem.\n\nFollowing a bench trial conducted from April 19 to June 22, 1999,\nthe court, on September 9, 1999, filed its Memorandum of Decision\nand Order, from which this appeal is taken. See Capacchione v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416911/capacchione-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D.N.C. 1999).\nAlthough the Board claimed that unitary status had not been achieved,\nthe district court found that it had. In its ruling, the district court then\nfound that the Board's expanded magnet schools program, even\nthough instituted to effect court-ordered desegregation, was unconsti-\ntutional. Furthermore, the court enjoined the Board from \"assigning\nchildren to schools or allocating educational opportunities and bene-\nfits through race-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other\nmeans that deny students an equal footing based on race.\" Id. at 294.\nFinally, the court awarded the Capacchione plaintiffs nominal mone-\ntary damages and substantial attorney's fees.\n\nFollowing the filing of timely notices of appeal, the Swann plain-\ntiffs and CMS sought a stay of Judge Potter's September 9, 1999\ninjunction. On December 30, 1999, we granted the requested stay\npending further order of this court. Thereafter, the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs petitioned for an initial hearing en banc, which was denied by an\neight-to-three vote of the Court. Belk v.

The panel heard argument in\nthese appeals on June 7, 2000.\n\nC.\n\nWe are now called upon to review the district court's various deter-\nminations relating to these consolidated appeals. Having reviewed\nand carefully considered each of the important questions determined\nby the district court, we affirm in part; however, we must reverse in\npart, and we must vacate and remand on certain issues.\n\nThe district court's findings suffice to uphold its determination that\nthe Board achieved progress toward desegregation in the 1970s and\n\n                   19\n\f1980s, and the court was therefore justified in concluding that CMS\nhad achieved unitary status in some respects. However, the district\ncourt's findings do not support its conclusion that CMS has attained\nunitary status in every respect. Moreover, even if CMS could now\nproperly be found to have achieved unitary status in toto, it would be\ninappropriate to assess the expanded magnet schools program as if\nthere had been no court order in place. The expanded magnet schools\nprogram and the race-conscious lottery it employed were undertaken\nto remedy the effects of past segregation and were in compliance with\ncourt orders governing this case; they do not violate the Constitution.\nConsequently, the award of nominal damages, substantial attorney's\nfees, and an overbroad injunction barring any future consideration of\nrace in school assignments and other fundamental aspects of school\noperations cannot stand.\n\nII.\n\nWe first address the district court's unitary status decision. The\ndetermination of whether any part of a school system has achieved\nunitary status is a factual one; therefore, we review the district court's\nfindings as to unitary status for clear error.

Indeed, the Supreme Court recognized as much in\nSwann, noting that North Carolina was one of the states with \"a long\nhistory of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system\n\n                  20\n\fdeliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate\npupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\" 402 U.S. at 5-6. In this\ncontext the remedies forcefully endorsed in Brown II, including the\nuse of race conscious measures, are necessary to eradicate the invidi-\nous segregation at which they are aimed.\n\nMoreover, court supervision over local school boards, also\nembraced in Brown and its progeny, is entirely appropriate whenever\n\"school authorities fail in their affirmative obligations\" \"to take what-\never steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination would be eliminated.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 15.\nNot only are the federal courts entitled to supervise and direct the\nactions of local school boards under those circumstances, but the\nscope of federal authority is almost plenary: \"Once a right and a vio-\nlation have been shown, the scope of a district court's equitable pow-\ners to remedy past wrongs is broad, for breadth and flexibility are\ninherent in equitable remedies.\" Id. There is no doubt that CMS was\njustifiably subjected to federal court supervision; in fact, even after\nthe Board had been subjected to court supervision, it had to be repeat-\nedly ordered to begin the process of desegregation.\n\nUltimately, however, the goal in a desegregation case such as this\nis to reach the point at which federal supervision is no longer war-\nranted and the use of race-conscious measures is no longer necessary.\nSee Freeman, 503 U.S. at 489. The Supreme Court has identified six\nfactors (collectively the \"original Green factors\") that must be free\nfrom racial discrimination before the mandate of Brown is met: (1)\nstudent assignment, (2) physical facilities, (3) transportation, (4) fac-\nulty, (5) staff, and (6) extracurricular activities. Green, 391 U.S. at\n435. Not only are reviewing courts to ascertain whether these original\nGreen factors are free from racial discrimination, but courts also are\nentitled, in their discretion, to identify other factors (\"ancillary factors\")5\n                                                                              5\nand \"determine whether minority students were being disadvantaged\nin ways that required the formulation of new and further remedies to\nensure full compliance with the court's decree.\" 503 U.S. at 492.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5 For convenience, we refer to the original Green factors and any ancil-\nlary factors identified by the district court as \"Green factors.\"\n\n                   21\n\f2.\n\nFor school systems proceeding through the difficult process of\ndesegregation, the Supreme Court has adopted the goal of achieving\nunitary status. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 486-87; Board of Educ. of Okla.\nCity Pub. Sch. v. Dowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245-46 (1991). Although\nprior to the Court's Dowell and Freeman decisions federal courts used\nthe term \"unitary status\" somewhat inconsistently, see Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 486-87; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38, the term has now come\nto mean that the school system has been unified such that the vestiges\nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 487; Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38. When a school sys-\ntem achieves unitary status, federal courts must withdraw supervision\nover the local school board.\n\nIn this case, Judge Potter declared that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus in every respect. The Supreme Court has directed that an appel-\nlate court review a district court's unitary status determination by\napplying a two-part inquiry (the \"Freeman inquiries\"). An appellate\ncourt must determine if (1) a school Board has, in good faith, com-\nplied with the desegregation decree since it was entered; and (2) the\nvestiges of de jure segregation in the school system have been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50).\n\nIf the party seeking a declaration of unitary status cannot demon-\nstrate that the school system has achieved unitary status in its entirety,\nwe then undertake to determine whether the school system has\nachieved unitary status with respect to one or some of the Green fac-\ntors (\"partial unitary status\"). At that point, we apply, with respect to\neach Green factor, the two Freeman inquiries along with one addi-\ntional Freeman-mandated inquiry: \"whether retention of judicial con-\ntrol [over one aspect of the school system] is necessary or practicable\nto achieve compliance with the decree in other facets of the school\nsystem.\" Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491. This third Freeman inquiry rec-\nognizes that the Green factors are -- to a great extent -- interrelated,\nand when determining whether judicial supervision over a school\nboard may be withdrawn, the overlap between the Green factors is a\ncrucial consideration.\n\n                  22\n\fThe Freeman analysis brings us to the most difficult questions\npresented in any desegregation case: whether present racial isolation\nis a vestige of past segregation and, if so, whether a school board can\npracticably reduce that racial isolation. It is even difficult to define\n\"vestige\" in this context. See id. at 502 (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"We\nhave never sought to describe how one identifies . . . a `vestige' or\na `remnant' of past . . . .\"). The vestiges \"that are the concern of the\nlaw may be subtle and intangible but nonetheless they must be so real\nthat they have a causal link to the de jure violation being remedied.\"\nId. at 496 (Kennedy, J.); see also id. at 512 (Souter, J., concurring)\n(citing Columbus Bd. of Educ. v.

We adhere to the most common-sense meaning of \"vestige\":\nit is a condition or occurrence causally related to the former de jure\nsystem of segregation.\n\nBecause a school system's duty to eliminate such vestiges is\nrestricted by the availability of practicable measures for doing so, see\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492, it is also incumbent on us to consider prac-\nticability. In determining the practicability of further measures, the\ndistrict court must look to numerous indicia of the system's operation.\nPracticability depends on the feasibility of the proposed method, from\nboth a financial and an administrative perspective. Cf. id. at 481-83,\n493-97. Whether a measure is practicable also depends on whether it\nis \"directed to curing the effects of the specific violation,\" and\nwhether it is likely to do so. Id. at 497.\n\nOur duty, in reviewing Judge Potter's decision, see Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 228, is clear. We must examine each Green factor\nand ascertain whether unitary status has been achieved with respect\nto any or all of them. Because the district court declared the entire\nCMS school system to have achieved unitary status, we must assess,\nwith respect to each Green factor, whether the Board has complied,\nin good faith, with the desegregation decree and whether the vestiges\nof segregation have been eliminated to the extent practicable. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 492 (citing Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50). If the\nschool system has not achieved unitary status in its entirety, then,\n\n                   23\n\fconsistent with Freeman, we also must weigh the degree of interre-\nlatedness existing between the various Green factors.\n\nB.\n\nBy way of introduction to our analysis of this case, we first address\na fundamental flaw in the district court's proceedings -- a flaw aris-\ning from the district court's failure to give any consideration to a\nremedial plan sought to be admitted as evidence by CMS. Following\nthe filing of the Capacchione plaintiffs' Complaint in Intervention,\nthe Board undertook to produce a comprehensive analysis of whether\nvestiges of de jure segregation existed in CMS and whether any such\nvestiges could be practicably remedied. The Board analyzed available\ndata and identified several vestiges remaining; then, in line with the\nmandate of Freeman, the Superintendent of CMS developed a plan\ncontaining practicable remedial steps. The Board independently\nreviewed this plan and, on March 30, 1999, adopted the \"Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Schools' Remedial Plan to Address the Remaining Ves-\ntiges of Segregation\" (the \"Plan\" or \"Remedial Plan\"). J.A. 11029.\n\nConsistent with pretrial deadlines, CMS filed the Remedial Plan\nwith the district court as a potential exhibit at trial. J.A. 11028. At the\npretrial conference conducted on April 13, 1999, the Capacchione\nplaintiffs moved in limine to exclude the Remedial Plan. In essence,\nthe Capacchione plaintiffs maintained that the trial had been bifur-\ncated into two phases and that only unitary status was at issue in the\nfirst phase. They further maintained that the Remedial Plan contained\nproposed remedies that could only be implemented if CMS was deter-\nmined not to have achieved unitary status. Because the unitary status\nquestion had not yet been resolved, they claimed that the Remedial\nPlan (which the Capacchione plaintiffs characterized as a damages\nreport) was irrelevant.\n\nIn opposing exclusion of the Remedial Plan, CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs relied on the Supreme Court's Freeman analysis. J.A. 1421.\nSpecifically, they asserted that each unitary status determination\nencompassed in the first phase of the trial turned on \"whether the ves-\ntiges have been remedied to the extent practicable.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded). The Remedial Plan, they claimed, was not merely relevant,\n\n                   24\n\fbut crucial, to establishing both the existence of vestiges of segrega-\ntion and the practicability of remedial measures.\n\nJudge Potter responded with two rulings. First, Judge Potter\nexplained in assessing whether CMS had achieved unitary status that\nhe believed Freeman required him to consider just one thing: \"only\n. . . what CMS has done, not what it may do in the future.\" See Order\nof April 14, 1999 at 4. Second, based on this understanding of Free-\nman and the unitary status test, Judge Potter concluded that the Reme-\ndial Plan was irrelevant: \"If the Court later determines that additional\nremedial measures are needed, it may consider the plan. Until that\ntime comes, however, the Court will not get mired in the complex\ndetails and mechanics of a proposed plan.\" Id. at 5.6\n                                                    6\n\nWe believe Judge Potter erred in both of these rulings. First, he\nmisapprehended Freeman and its test for unitary status. At the outset,\nFreeman explicitly rejects, as a matter of law, the very analysis\nadopted by the district court. That is, under Freeman, a district court\nmust consider (1) compliance with prior orders (i.e., \"what CMS has\ndone\"), and (2) whether vestiges have been eliminated to the extent\npracticable (i.e., \"what [CMS] may do in the future\"). See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 491; see also Order of April 14, 1999 at 4. By construing\nFreeman's unitary status test to include the former (\"what CMS has\ndone\") but not the latter (\"what [CMS] may do in the future\"), Judge\nPotter erred as a matter of law.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Judge Potter also chided CMS for proffering the Remedial Plan \"after\nthe deadline for fact discovery and expert witness discovery had\nexpired.\" On the contrary, CMS fulfilled all of its duties under the fed-\neral rules, appropriately supplementing its responses to discovery\nrequests as soon as the Remedial Plan had been adopted. Furthermore,\na more precipitant proposal could not have incorporated the various\nexpert perspectives developed during discovery. A similar plan submit-\nted earlier in the course of the litigation necessarily would have been\nbased largely on speculation and supposition, and therefore would have\nbeen far less useful and pertinent. As it was, the Plan was tendered in\nadvance of the non-jury trial, and, of great significance, almost five\nmonths before the district court issued its decision. Neither the court nor\nthe parties could have been inconvenienced by the necessary timing of\nthe Remedial Plan's submission.\n\n                  25\n\fThe Remedial Plan directly addresses the latter inquiry, and it does\nso in an apt, informed manner, relying on the considered opinions of\nhighly capable professionals retained to analyze the latest available\ndata. In other words, the district court's second reason for excluding\nthe Plan -- relevancy -- also fails to withstand scrutiny.77 There is no\ndoubt that Judge Potter had wide discretion on this issue, but rele-\nvancy is a fluid concept under the Federal Rules of Evidence. See\nFed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any ten-\ndency to make the existence\" of any material fact\"more probable or\nless probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently,\nrelevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. See,\ne.g., United States v. Van Metre, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756456\"><a href=\"/opinion/756456/united-states-v-james-howard-van-metre-united-states-of-america-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (4th Cir. 1998)\n(citing United States v.

The Remedial Plan identified record evi-\ndence (including the deposition testimony of several experts) support-\ning the Board's belief that vestiges of de jure segregation in CMS\nremain apparent in (1) faculty assignment and quality, (2) physical\nfacilities and the allocation of instructional resources, (3) student\nachievement, and (4) student assignment. More importantly, the\nRemedial Plan detailed specific steps that the Board proposed to\nundertake over the course of the ensuing five years \"with a goal of\nachieving unitary status at that time.\" J.A. 11029.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7 Taking the district court at its word that the only question before it\ninitially was the extent of the Board's compliance with the prior desegre-\ngation orders, the Remedial Plan was nonetheless highly relevant for\neven that purpose. The ease with which some of the proposed Plan reme-\ndies could be realized, e.g., merely distributing available funding to\naddress the stark disparity in basic resources such as instructional materi-\nals and media centers, see J.A. 11040, strongly suggests that the Board\nhad not fully implemented the long-standing dictates of the prior orders.\nThe court nonetheless observed that \"while the goal of perfect compli-\nance with court orders has remained elusive, no evidence has been\npresented that school authorities were guilty of easily correctable errors.\"\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

To the contrary, the Plan thoroughly\ndocumented the Board's failings and the facility with which they could\nbe rectified. The district court simply chose to ignore this highly relevant\nevidence.\n\n                  26\n\fWithout a doubt, federal courts possess the final word in deciding\nwhether a particular school system is operating within the parameters\nof the Constitution. Appreciable weight must be given, however, to\nthe views of those selected by the community to administer the sys-\ntem. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 248 (noting specialized knowledge pos-\nsessed by local school officials).8\n                                  8 In refusing to consider the Plan, the\ndistrict court erroneously failed to accord the Board's official position\nany weight, much less the respect that it was due.\n\nThat the district court so completely disregarded this crucial evi-\ndence is telling. Nonetheless, we have carefully examined each con-\nclusion below, ever mindful of the deference accorded the factfinder.\nThe manifest importance of this case (quite apart from the substantial\ntime and energy invested by the parties and the court below) demands\nthat we carefully explain the myriad aspects of our decision today.\nWe now embark upon that task.\n\n1. Student Assignment\n\nOf all the Green factors, the most fundamental is the degree of\nracial imbalance in student assignment. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474.\nUniformity in the racial composition of a given school was the hall-\nmark of official discrimination, \"for under the former de jure regimes\nracial exclusion was both the means and the end of a policy motivated\nby disparagement of, or hostility towards, the disfavored race.\" Id.\nCourt-ordered desegregation was designed to meet the enemy head-\non; the long-term stability of attempts at racial balancing in student\nassignment is often seen as the most conspicuous indication of the\ncourts' success (or lack thereof) in combating the underlying societal\nevil.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8 Though we need not grant CMS the same deference afforded the pro-\nmulgations and adjudications of a federal administrative agency, the for-\nmal declarations of its governing Board \"do constitute a body of\nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may\nproperly resort for guidance.\" Ritter v.

In doing so, we are bound to focus particularly on the\nBoard's record of compliance with the district court's desegregation\norders. See id. at 492 (citing Dowell). Because significant and grow-\ning racial imbalances in student assignment do exist in CMS, because\nthe Board for decades has failed to comply with certain specific\ndecrees of the district court (particularly regarding the siting of new\nschools), because these failures may have contributed to current racial\nisolation, and because future compliance might practicably reduce\nthis racial isolation, we must vacate the district court's finding that\nCMS has achieved unitary status with respect to student assignment.\n\na.\n\nIn the wake of the 1970 desegregation order, virtually all of the\nschools in CMS operated in racial balance for a considerable time. By\n1998-99 however, nearly thirty percent of the schools in the system\nhad become racially identifiable.9\n                                 9 Of the 126 schools included in the\nCMS desegregation plan, twenty-three are identifiably black and thir-\nteen more are identifiably white. J.A. 11587. Further, virtually all of\nthe identifiably black schools are located in either the inner city or in\nthe immediate northwest-to-northeast suburbs, the areas of Mecklen-\nburg County with the highest concentration of African-Americans. In\nstark contrast, all thirteen of the identifiably white schools are found\nin the extreme northern and southern areas of the county, both of\nwhich (and particularly the latter) have seen dramatic increases in\nwhite population during the past thirty years. The trend in CMS\ntoward resegregation of its schools has accelerated markedly since the\nmove to de-emphasize satellite zones and mandatory busing in 1992.\nIn the last seven years, the number of CMS African-American stu-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 Judge McMillan's final desegregation order mandated, inter alia, that\nno school should become \"racially identifiable.\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at\n268. Judge Potter interpreted the phrase synonymously with \"racially\nimbalanced,\" which, as noted within, describes a school with an African-\nAmerican student population deviating more than fifteen points in either\ndirection from the county-wide norm. See Cappachione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

J.A. 9589.\n\nIndisputably, from 1981 until 1997, the CMS school system went\nthrough significant demographic changes. For example, the total pop-\nulation of Mecklenburg County has grown from 354,656 in 1970 to\n613,310 in 1997. J.A. 16247. Almost 100,000 children attend CMS,\nmaking it the twenty-third largest school system in the country. J.A.\n7107. During the period from 1970 to 1997, the black school-age pop-\nulation (ages 5 through 17) in the county has increased by approxi-\nmately 10,000. J.A. 16247. Over the same period, the corresponding\nwhite school-age population has decreased by approximately 3,000,\nid., and by 1997, African-Americans comprised 34 percent of the\ncounty's school-age population, the total of which numbered approxi-\nmately 108,600. Evidence before the district court revealed that, since\n1970, the growing African-American population has migrated out-\nward from the inner city into formerly white suburbs. In turn, many\nwhite citizens who formerly populated the city's periphery have\nmoved even farther into the county's outlying reaches. Though parts\nof the county have become more integrated as the result of these\nshifts, a disproportionately large number of African-Americans still\nreside in contiguous clusters generally north and west of the down-\ntown area.\n\nThe primary issue we must address is whether the thirty-six racially\nidentifiable schools in CMS represent a vestige of segregation -- that\nis, whether the present racial isolation is causally related to the prior\nsystem of de jure segregation. The Swann plaintiffs argue, and CMS\nagrees, that current racial isolation, like the racial isolation of the\n1960s and 1970s, results both from past inequities that, to some\nextent, have persisted to this day, and from the Board's failure to\ncomply with certain specific directives in the remedial decrees in this\ncase.\n\nBecause CMS has not previously been adjudged to have achieved\nunitary status in student assignment, we are bound under Swann to\npresume that the current racial imbalance in the school population\nconstitutes a continuing vestige of segregation. 402 U.S. at 26. The\nCapacchione plaintiffs have the burden of showing that the present\nexistence of predominantly one-race schools in CMS \"is not the result\n\n                  29\n\fof present or past discriminatory action.\" Id.; see also Riddick, 784\nF.2d at 535.\n\nOur unwillingness to affirm the conclusion that CMS is unitary\nwith respect to student assignment centers on the Board's failure to\ncomply with court orders regarding selection of sites for the construc-\ntion of new schools. The role of school siting in achieving sustainable\ndesegregation should not be underestimated. In fact, the importance\nof site selection has been apparent since the early stages of this case.\nAs the Supreme Court explained in 1971:\n\n        In the past [site selection] choices . . . have been used as a\n        potent weapon for creating or maintaining a state-segregated\n        school system. . . . [S]chool authorities have sometimes,\n        since Brown, closed schools which appeared likely to\n        become racially mixed through changes in neighborhood\n        residential patterns. This was sometimes accompanied by\n        building new schools in the areas of white suburban expan-\n        sion farthest from Negro population centers in order to\n        maintain the separation of the races with a minimum depar-\n        ture from the formal principles of \"neighborhood zoning.\"\n        Such a policy does more than simply influence the short-run\n        composition of the student body of a new school. It may\n        well promote segregated residential patterns which, when\n        combined with \"neighborhood zoning,\" further lock the\n        school system into the mold of separation of the races. . . .\n        In ascertaining the existence of legally imposed school seg-\n        regation, the existence of a pattern of school construction\n        and abandonment is thus a factor of great weight.\n\nSwann, 402 U.S. at 21.\n\nSubsequent to the Supreme Court's decision in Swann, Judge\nMcMillan specifically ordered that site selection for new schools\ncould not \"be predicated on population trends alone.\" 379 F. Supp. at\n1107. New schools were \"to be built where they can readily serve\nboth races.\" Id. In the 1979 Martin decision,10\n                                             10 Judge McMillan\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10 Judge Potter incorrectly declared that \"Martin was not a unitary sta-\ntus hearing[.]\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In fact, as the accom-\n\n                   30\n\fdevoted an entire section of his opinion to demonstrating that \"con-\nstruction, location and closing of school buildings continue to pro-\nmote segregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1329. Judge McMillan explained\nthat \"[t]he location of schools plays a large if not determinative role\nin . . . insuring that any given assignment and feeder plan will provide\nmeaningful desegregation, rather than just the predictably short lived\nappearance of desegregation.\" Id. at 1332.\n\nIn the years since this decree was issued, CMS has built twenty-\nfive of twenty-seven new schools in predominantly white suburban\ncommunities. In the mid-1980s, CMS adopted a formal policy of\nbuilding \"midpoint\" schools -- schools located midway between\nblack and white population centers. There is little evidence, however,\nto suggest that CMS faithfully adhered to this policy. Rather, record\nevidence strongly indicates that the policy influenced the site selec-\ntion for, at most, four of the twenty-seven new schools. See J.A.\n15404-06. Meanwhile, as we discuss infra, there is substantial evi-\ndence that CMS has allowed many of its older school facilities in the\ncity -- schools attended in disproportionate numbers by African-\nAmerican students -- to fall into a state of disrepair.\n\nThe Board's record of building the great majority of its new\nschools on the predominantly white suburban fringe of the county\nsupports two possible conclusions. On one hand, CMS could have\nbeen responding to demographic reality -- a demand for new class-\nrooms in areas of high population growth (although we note that the\nnumber of white students in CMS has decreased since 1970, while the\nblack student population has greatly increased). On the other hand,\nthe Board's pattern of school construction could have facilitated or\neven hastened white flight to the suburbs. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Swann, \"[p]eople gravitate toward school facilities, just\nas schools are located in response to the needs of people. The location\nof schools may thus influence the patterns of residential development\n_________________________________________________________________\n\npanying text indicates, the white parents in Martin contended, as the\nCapacchione plaintiffs do today, that CMS had achieved unitary status.\nIntervening African-American parents, like those herein, maintained to\nthe contrary. In actuality, there is little difference between today's case\nand Martin, and Judge McMillan's findings in the latter are as binding\non the parties as any others made in the course of this litigation.\n\n                  31\n\fof a metropolitan area and have important impact on composition of\ninner-city neighborhoods.\" 402 U.S. at 20-21. The Board's school sit-\ning policies could well evidence its lack of political will in the face\nof pressure to abandon desegregative policies -- pressure from fami-\nlies who \"are concerned about the racial composition of a prospective\nschool and [who] will make residential decisions accordingly.\" Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 513 (Blackmun, J., concurring).\n\nThere is certainly no evidence that CMS has intentionally sought,\nthrough its school siting policies, to \"lock the school system into the\nmold of separation of the races\" in the way that the Supreme Court\ndescribed in Swann. But the actual choices the Board has made with\nregard to school siting may in fact be quite similar to the \"pattern of\nschool construction and abandonment\" described by the Court, with\nthe actual effect that the Court feared of \"lock[ing] the school system\"\ninto a condition of racial isolation. 402 U.S. at 21. We cannot con-\nclude, at least in the absence of further fact-finding, that CMS, in\nchoosing sites for new schools, has pursued \"meaningful desegrega-\ntion, rather than just the predictably short lived appearance of deseg-\nregation.\" 475 F. Supp. at 1332.\n\nRather, the Board's practice of siting new schools such that they\ncould not reasonably be expected to serve a racially balanced student\npopulation and Judge McMillan's determination that this practice, in\nthe past, represented the school system's failure to eliminate the ves-\ntiges of segregation, together raise a strong inference that those ves-\ntiges remain today. When this inference is viewed in combination\nwith the burden borne by the Capacchione plaintiffs to show that cur-\nrent racial imbalances have no causal link to past discrimination, we\nare compelled to conclude that a remand to the district court is\nrequired.\n\nAlthough we defer to a district court's findings of fact unless\nclearly erroneous, Judge Potter's error here came in his application of\nthe legal standard to the evidence regarding the Board's school siting\npolicies. Judge Potter found that (1) CMS had not discriminated on\nthe basis of race in choosing sites for new schools and that (2) CMS\nhad incorporated racial diversity as one of its factors in site selection.\nEven assuming arguendo that both findings are not clearly erroneous,\nneither is sufficient to support the legal conclusion that in siting new\n\n                   32\n\fschools CMS acted in compliance with the governing court orders and\nConstitution to eliminate the vestiges of segregation to the extent\npracticable.\n\n\"To fulfill this duty, school officials are obligated not only to avoid\nany official action that has the effect of perpetuating or reestablishing\na dual school system, but also to render decisions that further desegre-\ngation and help to eliminate the effects of the previous dual school\nsystem.\" Harris v.

Therefore, CMS had to do more than merely select\nsites for new schools on a nondiscriminatory basis. It had to do more,\ntoo, than simply give some consideration to \"diversity\" in its selection\nof sites. To the extent practicable, CMS had to site new schools\n\"where they can readily serve both races.\" 379 F. Supp. at 1107; see\nalso Swann, 402 U.S. at 21; Martin, 475 F. Supp. at 1329-32. Judge\nPotter never found that CMS had met this standard, and as outlined\nwithin, there is substantial record evidence that CMS did not do so.\n\nIn accordance with Swann, the burden is on the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs to prove that vestiges of past discrimination do not remain, or\nthat nothing can practicably be done to remedy them. We note that\nJudge McMillan, in his last published decision in this case, clearly\nevidenced his understanding both that CMS had not done all that it\ncould do in the area of school siting and that future school siting deci-\nsions could practicably advance the process of desegregation. On\nremand, it is thus incumbent on the Capacchione plaintiffs to demon-\nstrate that conditions in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County have\nchanged sufficiently such that school siting no longer represents a\npracticable opportunity to eliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs have identified additional areas in which\nCMS has fallen short of its obligations under the court orders. For the\nlife of the desegregation orders, CMS has consistently placed the\nheaviest burden of mandatory busing on African-American students.\nCurrently, 80% of those students who ride the bus as a result of a\nmandatory assignment are African-American. J.A. 11515. Judge\nMcMillan repeatedly ordered CMS to distribute this burden more\nfairly. See 475 F. Supp. at 1339-40; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362 F.\nSupp. at 1232-33. Yet, CMS has utterly failed to do so. In addition,\n\n                  33\n\fCMS has never developed an effective system for monitoring student\ntransfers to ensure that the overall effect of such transfers is not to\nincrease the racial imbalance in the system as a whole. Again, this\nrepresents a failure to comply with the explicit instructions of the dis-\ntrict court. See 475 F. Supp. at 1337-38; 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04; 362\nF. Supp. at 1229-30. We are troubled by these failings on the part of\nCMS. They provide additional support for a conclusion that, in the\nface of political pressure, CMS has not done all that it could do to\neliminate the vestiges of segregation.\n\nFinally, the Board has itself taken the remarkable step of admitting\nits noncompliance with prior orders in this case. A school board's\nfrank acquiescence in a position inuring to its detriment (in this case,\nthe potential of ongoing judicial intervention), if not treated as con-\nclusive, should at least be considered with the utmost gravity. Under\nthese circumstances, we have no difficulty in determining that the dis-\ntrict court's conclusion that the Board's level of compliance was \"full\nand satisfactory\" must be vacated.\n\nb.\n\nIf the vestiges of official discrimination have indeed been elimi-\nnated to the extent practicable with respect to student assignment,\nthen there is little reason to prolong court supervision. In light of the\ndistrict court's failure, however, to recognize the Board's continuing\nnoncompliance with respect to student assignment -- administered as\nrecently as twenty years ago in a manner reinforcing the once-official\nnotion that African-Americans are inferior -- we have no confidence\nin the court's ultimate finding that these vestiges have now disap-\npeared. We are therefore obliged to vacate the portion of the judgment\nbelow relating to student assignment and remand for further proceed-\nings.\n\nOn remand, the district court must first determine whether, since\nJudge McMillan's decision in Martin, CMS has fulfilled its constitu-\ntional and court-imposed obligations with regard to site selection for\nnew schools. If CMS has failed to fulfill its obligations, the district\ncourt must then determine whether this failure contributed to the pres-\nent condition of racial isolation in the school system. Finally, if CMS\ndid fail to live up to its constitutional and judicially decreed obliga-\n\n                  34\n\ftions, and if that failure did contribute to the present racial imbal-\nances, then the court must determine if proper site selection is a\npracticable remedy for the lingering effects of the Board's past dis-\ncriminatory practices. If not, then the district court should relinquish\ncontrol over student assignment: there is nothing further that CMS\ncan practicably do to eliminate the vestiges of the prior de jure sys-\ntem.\n\nIf, however, proper sites can be found, then the district court should\nretain control over student assignment. The court might decide, for\nexample, that most or all new schools constructed over the next sev-\neral years be located proximate to the inner city or in midpoint areas\nalready integrated residentially. Conversely, the district court may\nconclude that more flexibility is required because of real estate costs,\ncrushing demand in the suburban fringes, or for some other sufficient\nreason. The court should also consider the efficacy of the Board's\nRemedial Plan as a limited term remedy for the racial isolation that\nwould otherwise continue to exist until the Board's newly redirected\nschool siting policies can begin to take effect.11\n                                                11\n\nOf course, some reasons will not be sufficient to deny African-\nAmerican students a remedy, should corrective action be deemed jus-\ntified. For example, political pressure and perceived resistance to\nchange by certain groups in the community will not suffice. Addition-\nally, logistical barriers merely making \"difficult\" the transport inward\nof outlying white students will likewise, if reasonably surmountable,\nnot be enough. Cf.

Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 508-09 (Souter, J., concurring).\n\n                  37\n\f1973, Judge McMillan assumed control over facilities and resources,\nfound inequities, and ordered CMS to remedy those disparities. See\nSwann, 362 F.

(finding\nDouble Oaks library not restored to standards several years after fire);\nid. at 1238 (ordering athletic facilities at West Charlotte High School\nimmediately upgraded to level comparable with other schools in the\ncounty). We must conclude that the Board has been subject to the\ncourt's jurisdiction as to its facilities since at least 1973. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 246 (school boards entitled to a \"rather precise statement\"\nterminating a desegregation order).\n\nThe asserted lack of a prior adverse finding should not have been\ndeterminative of the issue, especially as the district court in 1969 was\nnot focusing on a school system suddenly thrust into the judicial\narena, but was instead examining one that had been subject to court\nsupervision for nearly four years. Between the commencement of the\ninitial Swann lawsuit in 1965 and the district court's first mention of\nthe facilities issue in April 1969, CMS closed sixteen black schools.\nThe Board's en masse action gives rise to an almost undeniable infer-\nence that these schools were shut down because they were inferior,\nand the timing also suggests strongly that the closures were prompted\nby the judicial proceedings then underway.\n\nViewed in context, the most plausible conclusion is that the puta-\ntive equality mentioned by the district court in 1969 and 1971 was\nactually an endorsement of the steps that had been taken by the Board\nto remedy the inequities in facilities. In any event, CMS could not be\nsaid to have achieved unitary status absent a finding by the lower\ncourt that the Board had \"eliminated the vestiges of its prior discrimi-\nnation,\" embodied in an \"adjudicat[ion] . . . through the proper judi-\ncial procedures.\" Georgia State Conference of Branches of NAACP v.\nGeorgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460205\"><a href=\"/opinion/460205/georgia-state-conference-of-branches-of-naacp-mary-alice-covin-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1413 n.12 (11th Cir. 1985), quoted in\nDowell, 498 U.S. at 245 (noting distinction between school systems\noperating in an unitary fashion and those that have achieved unitary\nstatus, and observing that the former \"could be called unitary and nev-\nertheless still contain vestiges of past discrimination\").\n\n                  38\n\fThirty-five years have passed since the Board first acted to equalize\nits facilities, yet serious questions remain as to whether it has finally\nrealized that goal. Dr. Dwayne E. Gardner, an impressively qualified\neducational planner and consultant, compiled an exhaustive report for\nthe Board in which he evaluated the suitability of its school facilities.13\n                                                                          13\nDr. Gardner examined and personally visited more than half of the\nschools in CMS (including all of the high schools), analyzing a host\nof factors affecting educational quality. For the purposes of his study,\nDr. Gardner divided the subject schools into three groups: (1) all\nimbalanced-black schools; (2) all racially balanced schools in\nimbalanced-black census tracts; and (3) each remaining high school,\nalong with a set of elementary and middle schools randomly selected\nfrom the remaining schools and approximately equal in number to\nthose already included within the first two groups.\n\nEach school in the study was assigned a composite score from 0-\n100, indicating its worthiness. Schools scoring 44 or lower were, in\nDr. Gardner's opinion, so deficient as to merit replacement, while\nthose with scores between 45-59 were classified as needing \"major\nimprovements.\" Any school that scored 60 or above was \"considered\nto have the ability to serve the educational program adequately.\" J.A.\n12174.\n\nThe results of Dr. Gardner's study are troubling. The average score\nfor the forty Group 3 schools (racially balanced or imbalanced-white\nin predominantly white or balanced areas) was 61.7. Although the\nGroup 3 data indicate a situation that is far from ideal, the ten Group\n2 schools (racially balanced in predominantly black areas) fared much\nworse, with an average score of 56.3. The scores of the twenty-three\nGroup 1 schools (imbalanced-black) were worse still, averaging just\n53.3.14\n     14 At trial, Dr. Gardner confirmed that the disparities apparent\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 The district court found that the expert called on behalf of the Capac-\nchione plaintiffs, Dr. David J. Armor, could offer no reliable testimony\non the subject. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 264.\n\n14 It has been famously said (by either Mark Twain or, earlier, Benja-\nmin Disraeli, depending on one's source), \"There are three kinds of lies\n-- lies, damned lies and statistics.\" A common difficulty in dealing with\nstatistics is illustrated by the district court's analysis of Dr. Gardner's\n\n                   39\n\ffrom the above numbers were \"substantial\" with respect to the facili-\nties generally available to white and African-American children\nattending CMS. J.A. 6196-99.\n\nThe anecdotal accounts of a number of witnesses effectively cor-\nroborated Dr. Gardner's conclusions. See, e.g., J.A. 4992 (testimony\nof Board member Pamela R. Mange) (schools with \"more severe\"\nproblems tended to be predominantly black); J.A. 4769 (testimony of\nAnnelle Houk) (\"[T]he schools that were in the worst repair and had\nthe poorest supply of resources . . . were on the west side and they\nwere predominantly populated by black students.\").

The court first noted that, of the four schools scoring in the lowest\ncategory, two were in Group 1 and two were in Group 3. Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 264-65. Next, the court observed that the two highest\nratings accorded elementary schools were again split between Groups 1\nand 3. Id. at 265. Based on this selective culling of the data, the lower\ncourt concluded that \"the results of Dr. Gardner's analysis do not show\ndisparities along racial lines.\" Id. at 264.\n\nThe forest that is CMS is not sufficiently mapped by the documenta-\ntion of a few trees. We could accurately say, for example, that omission\nfrom Group 1 of the brand-new elementary school referred to by the dis-\ntrict court as having one of the highest ratings would lower the Group 1\naverage by more than a full point. Or we could state without error that\nseven of the twenty-three Group 1 schools (more than 30 percent) scored\nbelow 50, while only five of the forty Group 3 schools (12.5 percent)\nscored similarly. Indeed, we note that none of the Group 1 high schools\nscored higher than 46, yet all those in Groups 2 and 3 scored at 50 or\nabove. Of course, one would rightly view this latter declaration with\nsome skepticism once it became known that there are but fourteen high\nschools in CMS, only two of which were included by Dr. Gardner in\nGroup 1.\n\nThe pick-and-choose method gets us nowhere. The value of Dr. Gard-\nner's research lies in the general conclusions that can be drawn from the\nentirety of the data. The most obvious conclusion is that, as a general\nmatter, imbalanced-black schools in CMS are in worse shape than those\nattended by larger proportions of white students. Once we accept that\npremise, the lone remaining question of any significance is \"Why?\"\n\n                  40\n\fKramer's itinerary were Elizabeth Lane Elementary, a predominantly\nwhite school located in a prosperous suburban area of the county, and\nShamrock Gardens Elementary, a downtown school with an African-\nAmerican student population exceeding sixty percent. Mr. Kramer's\ndescriptions of his visits contrasted sharply:\n\n        [T]o compare Elizabeth Lane Elementary as an example,\n        which is a relatively new school located in Matthews, I\n        walked into that school, I was overwhelmed because I had\n        never set foot in a school that was like that before. It was\n        clean, it was light and airy, it was a beautiful facility. . . .\n        My overwhelming feeling was, wow, I wish my kids could\n        go to this school. And another observation that was very\n        clear was that when I looked at the student body, it was vir-\n        tually all white students, obviously, affluent, happy kids\n        having a great time.\n\n        On the other hand, my experience, for example, at Sham-\n        rock Gardens was shocking by comparison. I had never vis-\n        ited either one of these schools before, but to visit that\n        school which is in the inner city, the students are predomi-\n        nantly black students, it reminded me of a rundown 1950s\n        motel. There was literally no access to the rooms except by\n        outer walkways that were covered by rusted, dilapidated\n        overhead fixtures. . . . They were using closets and things\n        to teach children in. The carpets were stained and thread-\n        bare. . . . It just didn't feel clean, it didn't feel good. And\n        I can honestly say that as a parent, my heartfelt reaction was\n        relief that my children didn't have to go to school there.\n\nJ.A. 6098-99. Even those Board members who voted to pursue a\ndetermination of unitary status before the district court admitted that\ndisparity in facilities was a problem within CMS. J.A. 1817, 1820\n(testimony of James H. Puckett); J.A. 1918-19 (testimony of John W.\nLassiter); J.A. 2095-96 (testimony of Lindalyn Kakadelis).\n\nAlthough it seems reasonably clear that a racial disparity in facili-\nties exists in CMS, its cause is somewhat less apparent. The Capacch-\nione plaintiffs maintain that no discrepancies exist in CMS facilities,\nand even if they do, such discrepancies are totally benign in origin.\n\n                   41\n\fHad the Capacchione plaintiffs proved their theory, we would be con-\nstrained to affirm the district court's conclusion that unitary status has\nbeen achieved with respect to the facilities factor. The district court,\nhowever, required the Capacchione plaintiffs to prove nothing; it\ninstead erroneously placed the burden on CMS and the Swann plain-\ntiffs to affirmatively show that the present inequities in facilities are\na vestige of official discrimination, i.e., causally related to the prior\nde jure system of segregation. Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 267.\n\nThe district court erred as a matter of law in foreclosing the devel-\nopment of evidence relevant to a proper vestige analysis. We must\ntherefore remand this portion of the case to permit the parties and the\ndistrict court to elicit the additional facts necessary to fully consider\nthe question of causation with respect to the current racial inequities\nin facilities. Because CMS has not been previously adjudged to have\nattained unitary status, the Capacchione plaintiffs are charged on\nremand with the burden of demonstrating that the vestiges of past de\njure racial discrimination in the context of the school system's facili-\nties have been eliminated \"root and branch\" to the extent practicable.15 15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15 The district court made no findings as to whether practicable reme-\ndies exist with respect to facilities. In light of the court's refusal to con-\nsider the Board's proposed five-year Remedial Plan, we cannot\ndetermine in the first instance whether practicable remedies to the current\ndisparities exist. We therefore remand to the district court for develop-\nment on this point. We note, however, that the Remedial Plan specifi-\ncally identifies disparities associated with race in baseline needs for\nschools' instructional materials and media centers, and the lack of any\nstandardized criteria to evaluate the adequacy of these resources. J.A.\n11037-38. The Plan proposes to achieve uniformity in resources across\nschools by imbalanced allocations that reflect the schools' current\nresource gaps and imbalances. J.A. 11038-40. Likewise, the Remedial\nPlan identifies disparities associated with race in the instructional facili-\nties, and proposes building replacements or renovating existing facilities\nfor sixteen schools that are either racially identifiable as black or are\nlocated in a predominantly black census tract. J.A. 11041-42. Uniform\nbuilding maintenance standards and procedures are proposed. J.A.\n11043. Monitoring, evaluation, and development of appropriate criteria\nfor evaluation are also proposed to maintain equity across the school sys-\ntem's resources and facilities. J.A. 11038-40, 11042-43.\n\n                   42\n\f3. Transportation\n\nSchool bus transportation was at the epicenter of the original\nSwann litigation, specifically the degree to which involuntary busing\ncould be used to implement a remedial desegregation decree. The\nSupreme Court in Swann, of course, approved busing as a \"normal\nand accepted tool of educational policy,\" 402 U.S. at 29, at least to\nthe extent that the rigors of time and distance would pose little risk\nto the affected students' health or to the educational process as a\nwhole. See id. at 30-31. In the intervening twenty-nine years, CMS\nhas taken the Court's license to heart; during the 1998-99 school year,\nfive of every six students in the school system rode a school bus.\n\nUpon review of the Green factor of transportation, Judge Potter\nconcluded that \"a court may grant unitary status when transportation\nis provided on a non-discriminatory basis.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 267. In\nother words, according to the district court, a school system achieves\nunitary status with respect to transportation once it provides access to\ntransportation non-discriminatorily to black and white children.\nBecause CMS provides all children, regardless of race, access to\ntransportation, Judge Potter concluded that CMS had achieved unitary\nstatus with respect to this Green factor.\n\nWe must be mindful of the Supreme Court's command to consider\nthe interrelatedness of the various Green factors. See Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 491 (court must consider \"whether retention of judicial control\nis necessary or practicable to achieve compliance with the decree in\nother facets of the school system\"). In this context, we can only con-\nclude that the Green factor of transportation is so inextricably inter-\ntwined with the Green factors of student assignment and facilities that\nour vacatur on those issues also mandates vacatur on the factor of trans-\nportation.16\n           16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16 Pursuant to Freeman, the district court accepted the invitation of the\nBoard and the Swann plaintiffs to consider whether vestiges of official\ndiscrimination remain concerning the ancillary factors of student\nachievement and student discipline. The court found in the negative, con-\ncluding that CMS had attained unitary status in both areas.\n\nWith respect to the ancillary factor of student achievement, we must\nvacate Judge Potter's holding that unitary status had been achieved, and\n\n                    43\n\fThe Swann plaintiffs maintain and offer substantial record evidence\nthat the burdens of busing for desegregation purposes are being borne\ndisproportionately and unfairly by African-American children. Brief\nof Appellants at 31-32, 33-35; see Swann, 306 F. Supp. at 1298 (dis-\ntrict court commenting in initial stages of remediation that it did not\nintend \"to endorse or approve any future plan which puts the burden\nof desegregation primarily upon one race\"). Eighty percent of stu-\ndents who currently ride the bus as a result of a mandatory assignment\nare African-American. Judge Potter rejected any consideration of this\nevidence, holding that a school district has achieved unitary status\nwith respect to transportation as soon as it is provided on a race-\nneutral basis. The evidence, however, demonstrates the close interre-\nlationship of transportation with student assignment. In view of our\nconclusion that CMS is not yet unitary with regard to student assign-\nment, we think it is premature to relinquish control over transporta-\ntion at this stage. On remand, if the district court determines that CMS\nmust remain under court order to correct the current imbalances in\nstudent assignment, it should also retain control over transportation to\nensure that those imbalances are corrected in a way that is fair to all\nstudents.17\n          17\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nwe do so on a basis similar to our analysis of the Green factor of trans-\nportation. Judge Potter found that disparities in student achievement\nexisted but that the disparities (1) were not vestiges of de jure segrega-\ntion and (2) could not be remedied by any practicable measure. Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 280-81. An analysis of disparities in student\nachievement may only be appropriate once the school system has\nachieved unitary status in other respects. See Swann, 306 F. Supp. at\n1309 (\"Until unlawful segregation is eliminated, it is idle to speculate\nwhether some of this [achievement] gap can be charged to racial differ-\nences or to `socio-economic-cultural' lag.\"). At the very least, as with\ntransportation, student achievement in this case is inextricably inter-\ntwined with the other Green factors, particularly student assignment.\nTherefore, having vacated certain of the district court's rulings on unitary\nstatus, including its ruling with respect to student assignment, we must\nalso vacate the district court's conclusion on student achievement.\n\nWe have reviewed and considered the district court's consideration of\nstudent discipline, and we affirm the district court's resolution as to this\nancillary factor.\n\n17 While the Remedial Plan does not specifically address transportation\nas a Green factor, it does propose siting new schools in a manner calcu-\n\n                  44\n\f4. Faculty\n\nOur analysis of this factor must take two concerns into account. We\nmust determine both whether CMS has generally eliminated the ves-\ntiges of discrimination in faculty assignment, and whether the teach-\ners assigned to predominantly black schools are of comparable quality\nto those teaching in schools with large numbers of white students.1818\nSee Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (final desegregation order directing\nthat the racial composition of faculty assigned to each school reflect\nthat of the system at large, with the proviso that \"the competence and\nexperience of teachers in formerly or recently black schools will not\nbe inferior to those in the formerly or recently white schools in the\nsystem\").\n\nThe evidence at trial demonstrated that CMS assigned its faculty\nin substantial compliance with the desegregation order at least until\n1992, when school principals were granted the leeway to actively\nrecruit new teachers without the strictures of maintaining a specific\nracial proportion. As a result of this gravitation from centralized to\nsite-based control of faculty assignments, a trend away from propor-\ntionality has emerged. In 1998-99, one-third of the 126 schools cov-\nered by the remedial decree had a proportion of black faculty\ndeviating more than ten percent from the system-wide norm (about\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nlated to promote racial balance in CMS. J.A. 11042. If CMS chooses\nsites for new schools that are more accessible to the majority of the black\npopulation, we presume that fewer black students would have to be\nbused to the suburbs for purposes of desegretation. A new approach to\nschool siting would address the vestiges of past discrimination, if such\nvestiges remain, in those areas in which CMS has not yet achieved uni-\ntary status.\n\n18 The district court considered a particular school to be racially imbal-\nanced if its proportion of African-American students varied more than\nfifteen percent from the district-wide average. In 1998-99, African-\nAmericans represented 42.7% of the elementary students in CMS, 41.7%\nof the middle school students, and 39.6% of the high school students.\nJ.A. 11574. An elementary school would therefore be designated\nimbalanced-black if more than 57.7% of its students are African-\nAmerican; conversely, if African-Americans constituted less than 27.7%\nof the student body, the school would be designated imbalanced-white.\n\n                  45\n\ftwenty-one percent). Prior to the 1992 change in policy, no more than\none-sixth of the schools had ever been so situated.\n\nWe are satisfied that the current trend toward faculty imbalance is\nneither a vestige of the dual system nor the product of subsequent dis-\ncrimination. There is no evidence that this trend results from legal or\nadministrative compulsion within CMS or from perceptions about the\ndesirability or undesirability of teaching positions in schools that\nserve students of predominantly one race. In short, we do not perceive\na causal relationship between past de jure segregation and the present\nassignment of faculty members to schools within CMS.19 19\n\nNor do we think that this trend toward more racially imbalanced\nfaculties has resulted in disparities in the quality of teaching, as mea-\nsured by the instructors' years of experience and post-graduate work.\nIndeed, there is no significant difference in experience between facul-\nties at imbalanced-black schools as compared to those that are\nimbalanced-white. Faculties at black schools are about one year less\nexperienced than the district-wide average, while faculties at white\nschools are correspondingly more seasoned. This disparity may\narouse some initial concerns, until one is informed that the typical\nCMS teacher has spent more than ten years in the classroom. The\nupshot is that black and white students alike are, with no meaningful\ndistinction, enjoying the benefits of their teachers' substantial experi-\nence.\n\nThe difference in post-graduate education between black-school\nand white-school faculties is more pronounced. For every three teach-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n19 Even if the pattern of faculty assignments were somehow shown to\nbe a vestige of past official discrimination, the evidence before the dis-\ntrict court casts substantial doubt upon the Board's ability to effect a\npracticable remedy. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 258-59:\n\n        CMS runs the risk of losing significant numbers of teachers if its\n        faculty assignment policies become too restrictive. . . . Another\n        practical problem faced by the district is the fact that it must con-\n        stantly hire thousands of new teachers in the midst of a national\n        teacher shortage . . . [which] is especially pronounced with\n        regard to black teachers, particularly in this region of the coun-\n        try.\n\n                   46\n\fers holding advanced degrees who ply their craft at imbalanced-white\nschools, there are only two similarly qualified teachers assigned to\nschools that are imbalanced-black. Compared to the district average,\nwhite schools have a somewhat larger proportion of these highly\ntrained instructors, while the allotment granted to black schools is\nslightly less than the norm.\n\nAlthough these facts give us reason for concern, we think it impru-\ndent to disturb the district court's conclusion that the trial evidence\naffirmatively disclosed no link between past discrimination and the\ncurrent asymmetry. Most revealing on this point is that, until now, the\nissue of teacher quality within CMS has not been contested. The 1970\ndesegregation order mandating equal competence and experience in\nfaculty assignments was not meant to remedy disparities then exist-\ning, but was instead intended to caution against future imbalances. In\nthe intervening thirty years, there is little indication that CMS has\nneglected to heed the warning inherent in that order.\n\nThe district court did not clearly err in concluding that the develop-\ning disparities in teacher assignments and any (perhaps superficial)\ndeficiency in the quality of instruction currently afforded African-\nAmerican children are unrelated to the de jure segregation once prev-\nalent in the school system. We therefore affirm the lower court's find-\ning that CMS has attained unitary status with respect to faculty.20\n                                                                  20\n\n5. Staff\n\nIn substantially the same manner as it spoke to the allocation of\nteachers, the final desegregation order provided that \"the internal\noperation of each school, and the assignment and management of\nschool employees, of course be conducted on a non-racial, non-\ndiscriminatory basis.\" Swann, 311 F.

Inasmuch as the\nSwann plaintiffs raised no challenge to the school system's compli-\nance with the desegregation order in this regard, the court below\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20 Although the Board's official position, as outlined in its Remedial\nPlan, is that remediable vestiges of de jure segregation do remain as to\nfaculty assignments and quality, the clear weight of the evidence is to the\ncontrary. The district court's failure to consider the Plan was therefore\nharmless in this narrow respect.\n\n                  47\n\ffound CMS to have achieved unitary status with regard to its support\nstaff. We agree, and we affirm that aspect of the district court's judg-\nment.\n\n6. Extracurricular activities\n\nAccording to the evidence at trial, African-American students in\nCMS participate in athletics and hold class office at a rate proportion-\nate to their numbers. These same students lag far behind, however,\nwhen it comes to participating in co-curricular clubs and honors pro-\ngrams. J.A. 11634. However, the scope of our inquiry concerning\nextracurricular activities is limited. We need only determine whether\nthe school system permits its students equal access to extracurricular\nactivities, without regard to race.

With respect to such matters as transportation, sup-\nporting personnel, and extracurricular activities, no more than this\nmay be necessary. . . .

Par-\nticipation in honors programs and co-curricular clubs is strictly volun-\ntary, and there is no evidence that the lack of participation by African-\nAmerican students in certain activities reflects the efforts of CMS to\nexclude them. We discern no error in the district court's conclusions\nregarding this Green factor, and we therefore affirm its finding that\nCMS has achieved unitary status with respect to extracurricular activ-\nities.\n\nC.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing, we conclude that the district court\nshould be affirmed in its determination of unitary status with respect\nto faculty, staff, extracurricular activities, and student discipline.\nHowever, we also conclude that we must vacate and remand for fur-\nther consideration in the areas of student assignment, facilities, trans-\nportation, and student achievement.\n\n                  48\n\fVolume 2 of 3\n\n                49\n\fIII.\n\nWe now turn to the question of whether the Board's expanded\nmagnet schools program violates the Constitution.\n\nEven if we had concluded that the district court was correct in\ndecreeing that CMS has now achieved unitary status in all respects,\nany preceding remedial measures could not be analyzed as if they had\nbeen taken by a \"de facto\" unitary school district. Prior to the decision\nbelow, no court had ever determined that CMS had attained unitary\nstatus as to any Green factor. As the Capacchione plaintiffs concede,\nJudge Potter's decision -- not some earlier event-- \"terminated [the]\ninjunction\" issued by Judge McMillan and affirmed by the Supreme\nCourt. Brief of Appellees at 3.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made it clear that unitary status is a legal\nconcept that has no \"fixed meaning or content\" independent of the\njudicial proceeding in which \"unitariness\" is conferred. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 486-87. The Court has consistently held that desegregation\ndecrees remain in effect until they are terminated by a court in unam-\nbiguous terms. See Dowell, 498 U.S. at 244-46 (finding district\ncourt's prior determination of \"unitariness\" too ambiguous to dissolve\ndesegregation decree and emphasizing that litigants are entitled to a\n\"rather precise statement\" if a decree is to be terminated); Spangler,\n427 U.S. at 438-40 (holding that even an unconstitutional court order\nremains in effect until a \"definitive disposition\" is reached on the con-\n\n                   50\n\fstitutional objection). Thus, Judge Potter properly acknowledged that\nthe law would not support a judicial finding that a school district had\nattained unitary status at a point in time prior to the court's own uni-\ntariness determination.

Id.

See, e.g., Jenkins,\n515 U.S. at 92 (\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging\nvoluntary movement of students within a school district in a pattern\nthat aids desegregation on a voluntary basis, without requiring exten-\n\n                   52\n\fsive busing and redrawing of district boundary lines.\").21\n                                                        21 Further, no\nauthority suggests that magnet programs with race-conscious assign-\nment policies constitute an inappropriate vehicle for achieving deseg-\nregation under a court-sponsored plan. Indeed, it is difficult to see\nhow a magnet program devised, with court approval, to eliminate ves-\ntiges of segregated schools could do so if school authorities were not\npermitted to control the racial composition of magnet school enroll-\nment.\n\nBy the 1970s, CMS had established some magnet schools, which\nit called \"optional schools.\" These early magnet schools had race-\nconscious assignment policies. See 379 F. Supp. at 1106, 1108; J.A.\n2489. Moreover, they offered two special curricula -- \"open\" and\n\"traditional\" -- both of which constituted \"very rigorous academic\nprogram[s]\" not offered in \"conventional schools.\" J.A. 2489, 15683.\nJudge McMillan approved these magnet schools, including their race-\nconscious assignment policies. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105-106.\n\nIn 1992, the Board expanded its magnet schools program into a\ndistrict-wide system with a wider range of curricular choices. In the\nexpanded magnet schools program, the Board retained the curricula\nfirst available in the early magnet or \"optional\" schools -- the \"open\"\ncurriculum, emphasizing \"interdisciplinary approaches,\" and the \"tra-\nditional\" curriculum, featuring a \"highly structured program.\" J.A.\n16722-23. Furthermore, six of the early magnets that offered such\ncurricula prior to 1992 -- Myers Park, Elizabeth, Hawthorne, Irwin\nAvenue, Piedmont, and West Charlotte -- continue to do so today\nunder the expanded magnet schools program. Compare J.A. 13448,\n13529-40, 15683 (pre-1992 \"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets) with\nJ.A. 16722-23 (1998-99 \"open\" and \"traditional\" magnets); see also\nJ.A. 10061 (report indicating that pre-1992 magnet schools were\nincorporated into the 1992 expanded magnet schools program).22   22\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21 The courts' caution essentially anticipates the position of the Swann\nplaintiffs in this case: that magnet schools are insufficiently desegrega-\ntive at best, and that at worst they simply provide an \"escape hatch\" for\nwhite students who would otherwise attend majority black schools, leav-\ning those majority black schools even more segregated than they had\nbeen before.\n\n22 Judge Potter recognized that the optional schools \"were similar to\ntoday's magnet schools,\" both having countywide enrollment and a racial\n\n                   53\n\fRace is considered in assigning students to the magnet schools\ninstituted under the 1992 expanded program, just as it was in assign-\ning students to the original magnet or optional schools. See 379 F.\nSupp. at 1108. Specifically, under the expanded program, CMS allo-\ncates 40% of the seats in its magnet schools for black students and\n60% for students of other races. This ratio reflects the student popula-\ntion of the school system, which is approximately 41.0% black,\n52.2% white, 3.7% Asian, 2.5% Hispanic, and .5% American Indian.23\n                                                                23\nCMS generally assigns students to its magnet schools using two paral-\nlel lotteries, one for black students and one for students of other races.\nWhen there has been insufficient interest from black students to fill\nthe seats allocated to them in a particular school, CMS has sometimes\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbalancing target.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

He nonetheless\nconcluded that the schools established after 1992 under the expanded\nmagnet schools program \"differ from optional schools in that [the new]\nmagnets offer specialized curricula and thereby confer a benefit above\nand beyond the regular academic program.\" Id. at 286-87 n. 49. But\nnothing in the record supports this view. To the contrary, assuming\narguendo that \"specialized curricula\" constitute a \"benefit,\" the magnet\nschools instituted after 1992 provide precisely the same \"benefit\" as the\npre-1992 \"optional schools.\" See J.A. 10552 (proposed 1992 pupil\nassignment plan recommending continuation of six magnet schools\nalready in place); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter noting that magnet schools\nwere called \"optional schools\" prior to 1992); J.A. 10651 (Summary of\nFindings From Research on Magnet Schools explaining that \"[o]ur\noptional schools function as magnet schools\"); J.A. 13606, 15581 (Stolee\nPlan explaining that \"[the traditional schools presently existing in\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg are good examples\" of curriculum specialty\nschools, \"sometimes called magnet schools\"). After all, it was only\nbecause the optional schools did offer certain \"specialized curricula\" that\nparents (including Michael Grant, one of the Capacchione plaintiffs, J.A.\n2489) were willing, well prior to the 1992 expanded magnet schools pro-\ngram, to enroll their children in desegregated optional schools. See J.A.\n13641, 15616. In fact, the original six \"open\" and \"traditional\" schools\nremain among CMS's more heavily subscribed magnets. See J.A. 10292-\n340. Myers Park Traditional, for example, had 245 students on its wait-\ning list for the 1998-99 school year. See J.A. 2159.\n\n23 For simplicity, we often refer within to non-African-American stu-\ndents in the magnet schools as \"white.\"\n\n                  54\n\frefused to allow students of other races to fill those slots. Thus, race\nmay affect a student's chances of being assigned to a magnet school.\n\nB.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs contend that the expanded magnet\nschools program violates the Equal Protection Clause. Recognizing,\nif only implicitly, the difficulty in maintaining that actions taken pur-\nsuant to court orders violate the Constitution, they principally argue\nthat the expanded magnet program was not implemented under the\ncourt orders governing this case. Specifically, they first contend that\nthe Board's increased reliance on magnet schools constituted a \"vol-\nuntary desegregation plan implemented to counteract demographic\nchange,\" rather than a good faith effort to eliminate the vestiges of\ndiscrimination as required by the existing desegregation orders. Sec-\nond, they argue that the expanded program's race-conscious assign-\nment lottery violated the desegregation orders. Finally, they maintain\nthat even if CMS expanded its magnet schools program pursuant to\nand in compliance with governing court orders, strict scrutiny none-\ntheless applies and requires that the program be held unconstitutional.\nWe consider each contention in turn.\n\n1.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs note that implementation of the\nexpanded magnet schools program followed on the heels of demo-\ngraphic changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg area. As discussed in\nconnection with student assignment, supra, the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg area has experienced in recent decades both strong pop-\nulation growth overall and intensive out-migration from the city to the\nsuburbs and from older, inner-ring suburbs to newer suburbs in the far\nnorthern and southern areas of the county. For these reasons, the\nCapacchione plaintiffs insist that the expanded magnet program was\nnecessarily a response to demographic change rather than a true\nattempt to remedy past discrimination.\n\nWe cannot agree. First, Judge Potter \"accept[ed] that the school\nsystem was acting to . . . remedy[ ] the effects of past racial discrimi-\nnation\" in expanding the number of magnet schools in 1992. Capac-\nchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289. Ample record evidence supports this\n\n                   55\n\ffinding. See, e.g., J.A. 2716 (testimony of John Murphy, former CMS\nSuperintendent, that 1992 plan to expand the magnet school program\nwas among the \"creative strategies we could come up with to stay in\ncompliance with the court order\"); J.A. 3869-74 (testimony of Jeff\nSchiller, former assistant superintendent for research, assessment, and\nplanning for CMS, explaining that the 1992 student assignment plan,\nincluding the expanded magnet schools program, \"had the same\nobjectives as the one that it was going to replace, maintaining the\ncourt order,\" and that the objective of the expanded magnet program\nspecifically was \"to maintain the integration of schools through vol-\nuntary means\"); J.A. 15503-05 (1993 letter from CMS to the U.S.\nDepartment of Education discussing Judge McMillan's 1974 order\nand identifying the creation of additional magnet schools as among\nthe \"more effective ways . . . [to] meet[ ] the guidelines established\nby the Court\"); J.A. 13607, 15582 (Stolee Plan recommendation that\n\"[the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school desegregation plan should be\ngradually changed from a mandatory plan with little voluntarism to\na voluntary plan with few mandatory facets\").\n\nFurthermore, the dichotomy the Capacchione plaintiffs suggest\nbetween \"counter[ing] demographic change,\" on the one hand, and\nremedying past discrimination, on the other, oversimplifies both the\nlaw of school desegregation, particularly the Supreme Court's deci-\nsions in Green, Swann, and Freeman, and the practical reality of\nachieving desegregation in a large urban school district. From the\nearly stages of the Swann litigation, it has been understood that demo-\ngraphic patterns would complicate the process of school desegrega-\ntion. Indeed, remedies like school busing and satellite attendance\nzones would never have been necessary in the first place if the\ndemography of the community were not an obstacle to desegregation.\nIn a sense, Swann's basic teaching is that the Constitution sometimes\nrequires schools to \"counter demograph[y]\" in order to achieve deseg-\nregation. The Swann Court noted that the process of \"local authorities\n. . . meet[ing] their constitutional obligations\" had \"been rendered\nmore difficult by changes . . . in the structure and patterns of commu-\nnities, the growth of student population, [and] movement of families.\"\n402 U.S. at 14. The Court expressed concern that\"segregated residen-\ntial patterns . . . [would] lock the school system into the mold of sepa-\nration of the races.\" Id. at 21. Thus, CMS simply followed the\n\n                  56\n\fSupreme Court's guidance in Swann in regarding demographic\nchange as a problem inhibiting its progress toward unitary status.24\n                                                                  24\n\nMoreover, Freeman simply did not hold, as the Capacchione plain-\ntiffs necessarily imply, that demographic changes in a metropolitan\narea independently eliminate the vestiges of past discrimination. Nor\ndoes Freeman bar courts from targeting racial isolation resulting in\nsignificant part from \"private choice,\" if that isolation is also a vestige\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n24 The Capacchione plaintiffs contend that, given the obvious concern\nof school officials with demographic changes, \"CMS could not have\nbeen motivated by any desire to comply with its court-ordered duty to\neradicate vestiges of segregation.\" Brief of Appellees at 85. But this\nstands the analysis on its head. A court determines from the effect of their\nacts, not from their motives, whether school authorities comply with a\ndesegregation decree. See Wright v. Council of Emporia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108587\"><a href=\"/opinion/108587/wright-v-council-of-emporia/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n462 (1972) (\"It is difficult or impossible for any court to determine the\nsole or dominant motivation behind choices of a group of legislators, and\nthe same may be said of the choices of a school board. . . . Thus we have\nfocused upon the effect -- not the purpose or motivation -- of a school\nboard's action in determining whether it is a permissible method of dis-\nmantling a dual system.\") (internal quotations marks omitted). Moreover,\neven if motivation were relevant, the argument would fail. A fair reading\nof the record demonstrates that although school officials were obviously\naware of the demographic shifts, they viewed these shifts as an obstacle\nto achieving compliance with the Swann orders and to eliminating the\nvestiges of discrimination in the school system, not as the condition that\nitself necessitated a remedy. See, e.g., J.A. 13597-98, 15572-73 (Stolee\nPlan identifying \"a growing and moving population\" as one of several\nfactors creating instability in student assignment under the pre-1992 sys-\ntem of pairing and satelliting); J.A. 15504 (1993 letter from CMS to the\nU.S. Department of Education listing \"demographic and residential pat-\nterns\" as one of several increasing strains on the pairing system); J.A.\n2712 (testimony of former CMS Superintendent John Murphy that \"[w]e\nreally weren't going to be bringing about desegregation and racially bal-\nanced schools unless we began to address the issue of housing at the\nsame time.\"). The Board may have chosen sites for new schools in\nresponse to, or even in furtherance of, these demographic trends, see\nsupra, but in any event the Board also clearly evidenced awareness that\nthe population changes, particularly the greater distance between white\nand black population centers, would put a greater strain on the process\nof desegregation.\n\n                   57\n\fof past discrimination. The effect of such a holding in Freeman would\nhave been to overrule Green, which the Supreme Court did not pur-\nport to do. In Green, even though the school board allowed every stu-\ndent \"freedom of choice\" as to which school to attend, the formerly\nblack school remained all black and the formerly white school\nremained predominantly white -- wholly as a result, in some sense,\nof this \"private choice.\" The Green Court held that, although the pri-\nvate choices of students and their families were responsible for the\ncontinuing racial isolation of the schools' student populations, that\nfact did not preclude a finding that the racial isolation was also a ves-\ntige of past discrimination. Indeed, the Court held not only that it was\npermissible for the school board to take further action to desegregate,\nbut that the board was required to take further action in order to fulfill\nits \"affirmative duty\" to desegregate. Green, 391 U.S. at 437-38.\n\nAlthough Freeman recognized that, at a certain point in the process\nof desegregation, a court may determine that present racial isolation\ncannot be considered a by-product of the past regime of segregation,\nthe case does not require -- or even empower -- a school board\nunder a judicial desegregation order to make that determination on its\nown. Rather, so long as CMS was under court order to desegregate,\nit was required to treat racial isolation in its schools as a vestige of\nsegregation, and to take appropriate action to eliminate that vestige.\nSee Swann, 402 U.S. at 26.\n\n2.\n\nThe Capacchione plaintiffs next contend that the expanded magnet\nprogram's race-conscious assignment policy violated the desegrega-\ntion orders governing this case. With this argument, Judge Potter\nagreed, concluding that \"the way that CMS's magnet program uses\nrace . . . is significantly different from any assignment policy ordered\nor approved of in Swann,\" and thus constituted a \"material departure\"\nfrom the governing desegregation orders. Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 286-87.\n\nThat holding constituted clear error. Actually, Judge McMillan spe-\ncifically authorized and incorporated into his decree a race-conscious\nassignment policy for \"appropriately integrated optional schools.\" 379\nF. Supp. at 1103. The policy provided:\n\n                   58\n\f        Strict and central control must be exercised over all admis-\n        sions (reassignments) to each optional school in order to\n        fulfill the necessary ends that these schools be open to all\n        county residents and be integrated by grade at or above\n        approximately a 20% black ratio. Reassignments to optional\n        schools must not jeopardize the racial composition of any\n        other school.\n\n        Guidelines and central monitoring by the Pupil Assign-\n        ment staff with the respective school principals are to be\n        drawn up.

The actual enroll-\n        ment of the optional school may have to be guided by its\n        racial composition and by the number drawn from each\n        other school area, not by considerations of space and pro-\n        gram only.\n\nId. at 1108 (emphasis added).25\n                             25\n\nMoreover, one need look no further than Chief Justice Burger's\nopinion for the Supreme Court in Swann to find explicit sanction of\nthe use of racial \"ratios\" or proportions in assigning students to\nschools:\n\n        School authorities are traditionally charged with broad\n        power to formulate and implement education policy and\n        might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare\n        students to live in a pluralistic society each school should\n        have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting\n        the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an\n        educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers\n        of school authorities; absent a finding of a constitutional\n        violation, however, that would not be within the authority of\n        a federal court.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n25 In accord with this court-approved policy, from 1975 to 1991, prior\nto expansion of the magnet schools plan, CMS continued to use a race-\nconscious lottery system to control enrollment in optional, or magnet,\nschools. See J.A. 2489-91, 2822-23, 14502, 16885-89.\n\n                  59\n\f402 U.S. at 16 (emphasis added).\n\nJudge McMillan's orders also repeatedly endorse the Board's\npower and duty to maintain control over the racial composition of the\nschools in order to eliminate the vestiges of the segregated system\n\"root and branch.\" For instance, in 1970 Judge McMillan mandated:\n\n        That the defendants maintain a continuing control over the\n        race of children in each school . . . and maintain the racial\n        make-up of each school (including any new and any re-\n        opened schools) to prevent any school from becoming\n        racially identifiable. . . . The duty imposed by the law and\n        by this order is the desegregation of schools and the mainte-\n        nance of that condition. . . . The defendants are encouraged\n        to use their full “know-how” and resources to attain the\n        results above described, and thus to achieve the constitu-\n        tional end by any means at their disposal. The test is not the\n        method or plan, but the results.\n\n311 F. Supp. at 268-69 (emphasis added and emphasis omitted); see\nalso 475 F. Supp. at 1342 (approving counsel's statement that \"if this\nBoard of Education chose to run an integrated school system on the\nbasis of preconceived ratios, it has that constitutional right\") (empha-\nsis added); 318 F. Supp. at 801 (ordering \"[t]hat `freedom of choice'\nor `freedom of transfer' may not be allowed by the Board if the cumu-\nlative effect of any given transfer or group of transfers is to increase\nsubstantially the degree of segregation in the school from which the\ntransfer is requested or in the school to which the transfer is desired\").\n\nThus, even if Judge McMillan had not specifically approved a race-\nconscious assignment policy for magnet schools, the Board's adop-\ntion of the 60-40 formula and lottery in the expanded magnet program\nwould not be an \"ultra vires\" act. Rather, that policy would fall within\nthe Board's broad discretion, recognized by both Judge McMillan and\nthe Supreme Court in Swann, to fashion appropriate remedies in light\nof the particular needs of its pupils and the school system's experi-\nence with other desegregation tools.2626\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n26 Judge McMillan's orders and the Supreme Court's opinion in Swann\ndid consistently signal concern with the imposition of racial proportions\n\n                   60\n\fJudge Potter's conclusion to the contrary simply cannot be recon-\nciled with the Supreme Court opinion in Swann and Judge McMil-\nlan's decrees. The race-conscious assignment policy constitutes a\nnecessary safeguard against the risk that unchecked transfers to mag-\nnet schools could increase the number of racially identifiable schools\nin violation of the Board's continuing obligation under the desegrega-\ntion orders. See 379 F. Supp. at 1105 (\"Racially identifiable schools\nmay not be operated.\"). In that vein, the Capacchione plaintiffs' own\nexpert on school desegregation, Dr. David Armor, agreed that racial\nquotas are permissible in a desegregation plan. J.A. 3627. Dr. Armor\ntestified that \"race is an integral part of pairing, of satelliting, of mag-\nnet schools, of running lotteries for magnet schools. The entire plan\nis predicated on race and race controls, because that's the only way\nyou can meet the court order and to have an effective plan is to\nemploy race requirements and racial quotas basically for all schools.\"\nJ.A. 3434.\n\nNor can Judge Potter's disapproval of the expanded magnet\nschools program be reconciled with other court-approved aspects of\nthe CMS desegregation plan. For example, the magnet schools assign-\nment policy takes race into account in much the same way as the\nBoard's majority-to-minority transfer policy, which was also specifi-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nor ratios by federal courts. That concern, however, is rooted in the prob-\nlem of federal courts exceeding their remedial discretion, not in any\nobjection to the use of racial proportions or ratios by school boards in\ntheir desegregation plans. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that, \"[t]he\nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of\nthe school system as a whole,\" but went on to conclude that \"the very\nlimited use made of mathematical ratios was within the equitable reme-\ndial discretion of the District Court.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25. That this\nconcern with ratios is rooted in the limits of judicial power to order\nremedial action, not in the impropriety of using racial proportions to rem-\nedy the vestiges of segregation, is nowhere more apparent than in Chief\nJustice Burger's statement in Swann. There the Chief Justice noted that\nwhile in certain circumstances it might be inappropriate for a federal\ncourt to require adherence to \"a prescribed ratio of Negro to white stu-\ndents reflecting\" the population of the \"district as a whole\", it would be\n\"within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities\" to do so. Id.\nat 16.\n\n                   61\n\fcally authorized by the governing desegregation orders. Under the\ntransfer policy, a student in the racial majority in his current school\ncould freely transfer to a school in which he would be in the racial\nminority. A white student in a majority white school, for example,\ncould freely transfer to a majority black school, but that same student\ncould be denied admission to a different majority white school, solely\non the basis of a rigid 50% racial ceiling. Meanwhile, a black student\nat a majority black school could freely transfer into the same majority\nwhite school to which the white student might be denied admission.\nThe Supreme Court approved this use of majority-to-minority transfer\npolicies as \"a useful part of every desegregation plan\" and \"an indis-\npensable remedy.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 26.\n\nJudge Potter misread the orders and injunctions governing this case\nby focusing solely on isolated words and phrases to conclude that the\ndesegregation decrees \"firmly rejected the use of rigid racial quotas.\"\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 286. Actually, in the same paragraph\nthat Judge McMillan held that \"[f]ixed ratios of pupils in particular\nschools will not be set\" by the court, he also held that \"efforts should\nbe made [by the school board] to reach a 71-29 ratio in the various\nschools so that there will be no basis for contending that one school\nis racially different from the others.\" 306 F. Supp. at 1312 (emphasis\nadded). Judge Potter transmuted this statement -- a requirement that\nthe Board make \"efforts\" to \"reach a 71-29 ratio\" -- into a prohibition\nagainst the Board assigning students to schools on the basis of that\nfixed ratio. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 286. We cannot\naccept this reading of Judge McMillan's order. Taken as a whole, this\nparagraph provides some of the clearest evidence that Judge McMil-\nlan not only authorized the Board to use fixed ratios in assigning stu-\ndents to schools but encouraged it to do so. Recognizing the\nimpracticability of adopting a court-ordered, system-wide racial bal-\nance to which all schools must adhere, Judge McMillan did observe\nthat \"variations from that [71-29 ratio] may be unavoidable.\" 306 F.\nSupp. at 1312. But that statement imposes no limitations on the scope\nof permissible Board action. Rather, it suggests that \"variations\" were\nacceptable only because they were \"unavoidable.\"\n\nIndeed, the Board could not have accomplished what the desegre-\ngation orders required it to accomplish without \"using race\" in the\nway that it \"used race\" in the context of the expanded magnet schools\n\n                  62\n\fprogram. In the 1970 order that was affirmed by the Supreme Court,\nJudge McMillan decreed \"[t]hat pupils of all grades be assigned in\nsuch a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various\ngrade levels have about the same proportion of black and white stu-\ndents.\" 311 F. Supp. at 268. We cannot fathom how the Board could\nset out to achieve \"about the same proportion of black and white stu-\ndents\" in each grade level in each of its over one hundred schools\nwithout employing fixed racial ratios as the central components of its\nstudent assignment plan. Neither, apparently, could Judge McMillan.\n\nTo achieve \"about the same proportion,\" the Board necessarily had\nto set fixed upper and lower limits on the proportion of white and\nblack students it would permit in each grade in each school. Only\nwith these fixed racial proportions as its lodestars could the Board\nassign students to schools, and approve or deny individual requests to\ntransfer. The Board could never have justified a denial of a transfer\nrequest without having a fixed conception of how few white or black\nstudents in a particular school would be too few.\n\nIn sum, contrary to Judge Potter's conclusion, Judge McMillan\nspecifically authorized the use of fixed ratios based on race in assign-\ning students to magnet schools. See 379 F. Supp. at 1104. Further-\nmore, even without such specific authorization, the broad discretion\ngranted the Board by the Supreme Court's opinion in Swann and by\nthe other court orders and injunctions governing this case permitted\nCMS to fashion magnet schools with racially balanced enrollments.\nThe decrees make plain that ratios based on race were among the\n\"means\" by which the Board was authorized\"to achieve the constitu-\ntional end\" of desegregation.\n\n3.\n\nFinally, the Capacchione plaintiffs maintain that, even if CMS\nadministered the expanded magnet schools program pursuant to and\nin conformity with the governing desegregation decrees, CMS vio-\nlated the Constitution in doing so. Judge Potter rejected this argument,\nas do we.\n\na.\n\nIn fact, court-ordered remedial action cannot be found violative of\nthe Constitution. Rather, as Judge Potter recognized, actions taken by\n\n                  63\n\fCMS pursuant to the desegregation decrees are immune from consti-\ntutional attack.

Thus, so long as CMS acts -- as it has -- to desegregate its\nschools in accordance with existing injunctive orders, its actions can-\nnot be challenged as unconstitutional.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court has twice expressly held that school\nboards under court orders to desegregate must comply with those\norders until absolved of that obligation by a subsequent court order,\neven when the existing desegregation order is improper or unneces-\nsary. In Spangler, the Court concluded that the district court exceeded\nits remedial discretion when it ordered the Pasadena school district to\nreconfigure its student attendance zones annually so that there would\nbe \"no majority of any minority\" in any school. 427 U.S. at 434-35.\nDespite the impropriety of this order, the Court held that the school\nboard was obliged to obey it until it was properly and explicitly modi-\nfied by a court. See id. at 438-40.\n\nSimilarly, in Dowell, the Court refused to interpret an arguably\nambiguous court order as having terminated the desegregation decree\npreviously entered against the Oklahoma City school board.

In fact, in those cases,\nthe courts emphasized that the school system had not been under a\ncourt order to desegregate, see Eisenberg, 197 F.3d at 124, and had\nadopted a magnet program \"not to remedy past discrimination, but\nrather to promote racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity.\" Tuttle,\n195 F.3d at 700 (emphasis added); see also Wessman, 160 F.3d at 792\n(noting that prior to instituting its magnet program the school system\n\"had achieved unitariness in the area of student assignments\" and that\n\"the district court thereupon relinquished control over\" that area).\nIndeed, in Eisenberg we endorsed the permissibility of race-based\nclassifications \"in situations,\" like that at hand, \"where past constitu-\n\n                   65\n\ftional violations require race-based remedial action.\" 197 F.3d at 130\n(citing Swann, 402 U.S. at 1); see also Wessmann, 160 F.3d at 795.\n\nThe distinction between a unitary school system and a school sys-\ntem under court order to desegregate is, from a legal standpoint, fun-\ndamental. Furthermore, as discussed supra, it is the judicial finding\nof unitary status, not any particular action by the school board or con-\ndition in the school system, upon which the distinction turns. Of\ncourse, for a formerly segregated school system, the attainment of\nunitary status reflects years or decades of gradual change, not an over-\nnight shift in policy or outlook. Although CMS will not look much\ndifferent the day it becomes unitary than it will have looked the previ-\nous day, attainment of unitary status triggers significant legal conse-\nquences. In a non-unitary school system, all one-race or\npredominantly one-race schools are presumed to be vestiges of segre-\ngation, and the burden is on the challenging party to show that those\nschools are nondiscriminatory. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 26 (\"The court\nshould scrutinize such schools, and the burden upon the school\nauthorities will be to satisfy the court that their racial composition is\nnot the result of present or past discriminatory action on their part.\").\nOnce a court has declared a school system unitary, on the other hand,\nthe presumption is that the vestiges of segregation have been elimi-\nnated, and a plaintiff seeking to demonstrate a constitutional violation\non the basis of the existence of one-race or predominantly one-race\nschools must \"prove discriminatory intent on the part of the school\nboard.\" Riddick, 784 F.2d at 537.\n\nAs Judge Potter recognized, see Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n285, CMS implemented and administered its expanded magnet\nschools program prior to ever achieving unitary status and while still\nunder court order to remedy the vestiges of segregation. Therefore,\nrecent decisions, like Eisenberg and Tuttle, addressing the constitu-\ntionality of magnet school assignment policies in unitary school sys-\ntems not under court order, are simply inapposite here.\n\nMoreover, even if Tuttle and Eisenberg generally applied to gov-\nernmental acts performed pursuant to remedial desegregation order\n(which they do not), the Board's expanded magnet schools program\nwould withstand constitutional scrutiny. This is so because if a prece-\ndent of the Supreme Court \"has direct application in a case,\" inferior\n\n                  66\n\fcourts must follow that precedent \"even if later cases appear to call\nit into question, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of\noverruling its own decisions.\" See Agostini v. Felton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118133\"><a href=\"/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n237 (1997).\n\nThere could hardly be a clearer case for application of this princi-\nple. Here the Supreme Court's Swann decision itself constitutes\ndirectly controlling precedent. In Swann, the Court concluded that\nCMS could be constitutionally required to make efforts \"to reach a\n71-29 ratio\" in the schools under its authority, and to assign students\n\"in such a way that as nearly as practicable the various schools at var-\nious grade levels have about the same proportion of black and white\nstudents.\" See 402 U.S. at 23-25 (approving Judge McMillan's order).\nIndeed, the Supreme Court again noted in Freeman that its decision\nin Swann specifically approved racial balancing by CMS to achieve\nthe remedial end of eliminating the vestiges of segregation. 503 U.S.\nat 493 (In Swann, \"[w]e confirmed that racial balance in school\nassignments was a necessary part of the remedy in the circumstances\nthere presented.\"). Under the principle articulated in Agostini, only\nthe Supreme Court itself can modify the decrees in this case to pro-\nhibit what Swann so clearly permitted.\n\nC.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in Swann is the law of the case; it\nmust be followed. But more than just the law of this case, for almost\nthirty years Swann also has functioned as a blueprint for school\ndesegregation in school districts throughout this Nation. As long as\nSwann is controlling law, and as long as the Board acts pursuant to\nthe Swann desegregation orders -- as it did in implementing the\nexpanded magnet schools program -- it cannot be held to have vio-\nlated the Constitution.\n\nIV.\n\nJudge Potter also enjoined CMS from \"assigning children to\nschools or allocating educational opportunities and benefits through\nrace-based lotteries, preferences, set-asides, or other means that deny\nstudents an equal footing based on race.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. at 111. In obtaining a declaration that the\nBoard has achieved unitary status as to four Green factors, the Capac-\nchione plaintiffs have not obtained \"an enforceable judgment, consent\ndecree, or settlement\"; they have not \"prevailed against\" CMS; nor\nhave they effected a \"material alteration of the legal relationship\"\nbetween the parties.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Capacchione plaintiffs succeed on remand\nin proving that CMS has achieved unitary status in all respects, they\nwould not, for these same reasons, be entitled to attorney's fees. A\ndeclaration of unitary status merely restores the parties to the status\nquo prior to the issuance of the desegregation decree. Such a declara-\ntion would not constitute \"an enforceable judgment\" for the Capacch-\nione plaintiffs. And though a declaration of unitary status would\nobviously represent a defeat for the legal position that CMS has taken\nin this litigation, such a defeat would not be tantamount to being \"pre-\nvailed against\" under § 1988. Rather, the primary significance of a\ndeclaration of unitary status would be that CMS has succeeded in\neradicating the vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practica-\nble and, as the Capacchione plaintiffs put it, in obtaining a \"return to\nlocal control.\" Brief of Appellees at 34. The Board, upon a declara-\ntion of unitariness, would actually have wider latitude to assign stu-\ndents as it sees fit than it did while it was under court order to remedy\npast discrimination (although certain race-conscious policies might no\nlonger be permissible). We are unable to see how a broadening of the\nBoard's discretion can be viewed as a \"material alteration of the legal\nrelationship\" between CMS and the Capacchione plaintiffs.\n\nWe note that the predominant pattern in the desegregation cases\nhas been to award attorney's fees to the original prevailing plaintiffs\n-- even for legal work related to the unsuccessful defense of a deseg-\nregation decree against a motion to modify or dissolve.

In the months before trial, CMS did\nnot respond to interrogatories by the Capacchione plaintiffs seeking\ndisclosure of fact witnesses. Instead, the Board waited until the week\nbefore trial to reveal the names of most of its fact witnesses, provid-\ning the Capacchione plaintiffs with a list of 174 names which it ulti-\nmately narrowed to twenty-six potential witnesses. The Board\nmaintains that its actions complied with the district court's pretrial\norder, which required the parties to provide a list of fact witnesses to\neach other \"[n]o later than the morning of the first day of trial.\" J.A.\n150.\n\nThe district court, however, granted the Capacchione plaintiffs'\nmotion for sanctions. The court held that it had established the rules\nfor disclosure of fact witnesses in an order of September 1998, which\nsuperseded the pretrial order. The September 1998 order denied the\nCapacchione plaintiffs' motion to compel disclosure of witnesses\nprior to the date established in the pretrial order for disclosure of\nexpert witnesses, but the court stated that \"CMS must supplement its\nresponses, as it promised, when such information becomes known.\"\nJ.A. 195. In awarding sanctions, the district court also indicated its\nconcern that CMS had been \"lacking candor in disclosing relevant\nand important information\" during the pretrial stage, that the disclo-\nsure of a list of 174 potential witnesses in the week before trial was\n\"extremely prejudicial to opposing counsel,\" and that many of the\nwitnesses on the list may have been \"irrelevant or unnecessarily\ncumulative.\" J.A. 305. As a result, the district court ordered a one-\nweek recess after the Capacchione plaintiffs' presentation at trial to\nallow them to depose, at the school system's expense, any of the\ntwenty-six witnesses on the Board's revised list.

CMS could\nplausibly have understood the deadline for disclosure of fact wit-\nnesses contained in the pretrial order to have continued in effect after\nthe subsequent September 1998 order given that the subsequent\norder's central effect was to reaffirm the deadline contained in the\npretrial order for disclosure of expert witnesses. Nonetheless, we can-\nnot say that the district court abused its broad discretion in finding\nthat its September 1998 order did in fact supersede the pretrial order,\nand that the Board's pretrial conduct had been unnecessarily dilatory\nand prejudicial to the Capacchione plaintiffs. We therefore affirm the\norder of sanctions against CMS.\n\nVIII.\n\nFor more than a hundred years, in fits and starts, our nation has\nattempted to undo the effects of its shameful heritage of slavery. For\nnearly fifty years, federal courts have struggled with the task of dis-\nmantling legally enforced racial segregation in many of our schools.\nThis task has given rise to one of the preeminent issues of constitu-\ntional law in our time. We do not yet know how history will regard\nthe courts' role in adjudicating and presiding over the desegregation\nof schools. It may be seen as a brief and unfortunate jurisprudential\nanomaly, justified only by the immediacy of the evil it was intended\nto uproot, cf. Freeman, 503 U.S. at 505-07 (Scalia, J., concurring); or\nit may be recognized as the necessarily sustained effort to eradicate\ndeep-seated vestiges of racial discrimination and to vindicate the\npromise of the Fourteenth Amendment, cf. Dowell, 498 U.S. at 266-\n68 (Marshall, J., dissenting); or it may be viewed in some other way\nthat we cannot now anticipate. Our decision today does not attempt\nan answer.\n\nBut we are certain that the end of this great task must be accom-\nplished in an orderly manner, consistent with and true to its origin.\nWe are certain, too, that if the courts, at some point, come to view the\n\n                  72\n\feffort to eliminate the vestiges of segregation as having been overly\n\"race-conscious,\" they must do so with a clear assessment of the his-\ntorical record.\n\nRace neutrality, of course, represents one of our constitutional ide-\nals. Properly understood, it is an ideal not at all in tension with our\nobligation as a society to undo the effects of slavery and of the racial\ncaste system that was perpetuated, for more than a century, in slav-\nery's wake. But we must be ever mindful, as we strive for race neu-\ntrality, that a reductive and willfully ahistorical conception of race\nneutrality was, in an earlier era, used as a blunt instrument against the\naspirations of African-Americans merely seeking to claim entitlement\nto full citizenship.\n\nIn striking down early civil rights legislation, the Supreme Court\nembraced this misconceived race neutrality, reasoning, only twenty\nyears after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, that the\nlegislation at issue would illegitimately make black citizens \"the spe-\ncial favorite of the laws.\" Civil Rights Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90897\"><a href=\"/opinion/90897/civil-rights-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1883).\nIndeed, the system of segregation with which we are concerned was\njustified at its inception by a particular conception of race neutrality\n-- that a regime of racial separation could be constitutionally justified\nso long as it applied neutrally and equally to persons of all races. See\nPlessy v. Ferguson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (1896) (\"We consider the\nunderlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the\nassumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the\ncolored race with a badge of inferiority.\").\n\nThe first Justice Harlan, dissenting in Plessy, declared our Consti-\ntution to be \"color-blind,\" id., 163 U.S. at 559, and in doing so pro-\nvided one of the most famous and compelling articulations of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equality. But in urging us to be \"blind\" to\nrace, Justice Harlan did not, as is sometimes suggested, suggest that\nwe be ignorant of it. In Plessy, he was the only member of the Court\nwilling to acknowledge the most obvious truth about segregation:\n\"Everyone knows that the statute in question had its origin in the pur-\npose, not so much to exclude white persons from railroad cars occu-\npied by blacks, as to exclude colored people from coaches occupied\nor assigned to white persons.\" Id. at 557. Thirteen years earlier, dis-\nsenting in the Civil Rights Cases, Justice Harlan rejected the notion\n\n                  73\n\fthat civil rights legislation made blacks a \"special favorite of the\nlaws,\" id., 109 U.S. at 61, and he criticized the majority's reasoning\nas \"narrow and artificial.\" Id. at 26.\n\nWe recognize now, as Justice Harlan recognized then, that no sim-\nple syllogism can enfold all of history's burdens and complexities.\nEliminating race-consciousness from government decisionmaking\nmust be regarded as among our worthiest constitutional aspirations.\nBut that aspiration surely cannot be so rigid that it refuses to distin-\nguish the \"race consciousness\" that created a segregated school sys-\ntem and the race-conscious efforts necessary to eliminate that system.\nWhile most judges are not historians, we must be willing to acknowl-\nedge and confront our history. If we fail to do so, we risk falling into\na mode that equates the cure with the disease: civil rights with favorit-\nism, desegregation with segregation. As American citizens, we know\nbetter.\n\nWe must and do sympathize with those who are impatient with\ncontinued federal court involvement in the operation of local schools.\nThirty-five years could be considered a long time for a school district\nto operate under judicial desegregation decrees. However, when the\nSupreme Court decided Swann in 1971 no one could reasonably have\nthought that the substantial task described there would be quickly or\neasily accomplished. CMS, which maintained a separate, decidedly\nunequal dual educational system for decades -- and which mightily\nresisted desegregation of any sort for years after it became the law of\nthe land -- has come a long way. While CMS has now achieved uni-\ntary status in certain respects, this record simply does not support a\ndetermination that the process of desegregation is at an end. Nor does\nit support a holding that CMS violated the Constitution when, pursu-\nant to court orders, it undertook judicially approved action to remedy\nits own long history of racial segregation.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate\nin certain respects, and remand this case to the district court for fur-\nther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART,\nVACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n\n                   74\n\fTRAXLER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\nFifty years ago a number of school boards ran schools with intent\nto divide the races. Black children went to predominantly black\nschools and were taught by black teachers. White children were\ntaught by white teachers in white schools. Equal resources and oppor-\ntunities were denied African-American children. In 1954 the Supreme\nCourt declared these practices to be violative of the constitutional\nrights of black children to equal protection of the laws. Federal courts\nwere directed to oversee the dismantling of segregated school sys-\ntems, Charlotte-Mecklenburg's included. When the old system was\nended and a constitutional system was in place, the federal courts\nwere to get out of the education business and to return the schools to\nthe control of the people elected to run them.\n\nThe district court began its oversight of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nschool system in 1965 and over the next few years worked with the\nschool system to develop a plan that would bring the school district\ninto compliance with the law. By 1975 the court concluded that the\ndesegregation plan in place then would work and that the case could\nbe closed as an active matter.\n\nSince that time two generations of students have passed through\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg's schools and, until the present case, not one\nperson has been back to court alleging that past segregative practices\nhave been continued. That is because the former system has been\neliminated to the extent practicable.\n\nYet now, when an effort is made to end federal court control, the\nschool board resists. The board would have the public and this court\nbelieve that for the last twenty years it has operated a school system\nwhich has continued to discriminate against African-American\nschoolchildren in disregard of both reason and the district court's\norder. If this is true, the people of Mecklenburg County should be out-\nraged. But, of course, it is not true. The district court found it not to\nbe true and it reached that conclusion for solid reasons.\n\nBecause I believe the facts show Charlotte-Mecklenburg has been\nsuccessful in its efforts to eliminate the segregative practices of the\npast, I cannot agree with a ruling that will keep the school district\n\n                  75\n\funder the yoke of federal court control. Mecklenburg County's posi-\ntion as a progressive metropolitan area is fact and not facade, and the\ntime has come to return the school system to it. Therefore, I dissent\nfrom a holding that would do otherwise.\n\nI further would find unconstitutional a policy that would deny a\nchild an open seat in a magnet school because of the color of the\nchild's skin. For that reason I also dissent from a holding that would\nreverse the district judge and permit such a practice.\n\nI.\n\nIn 1896, the Supreme Court upheld a Louisiana statute \"providing\nfor separate railway carriages for the white and colored races.\" Plessy\nv. Ferguson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (1896). The Plessy majority charac-\nterized the statute as \"not necessarily imply[ing] the inferiority of\neither race,\" id. at 544, but the first Justice Harlan, in dissent, aptly\ndescribed the true aim of the law: \"Everyone knows that the statute\nin question had its origin in the purpose, not so much to exclude white\npersons from railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored\npeople from coaches occupied by or assigned to white persons.\" Id.\nat 557 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan further \"den[ied] that\nany legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race\nof citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved.\" Id. at\n554-55 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Unfortunately, the principle of \"sepa-\nrate but equal\" reached much farther than Louisiana railways, and was\napplied to other public services, including education. The march of\nprogress eventually proved the correctness of Justice Harlan's princi-\npled stand. Segregation, in all of its manifestations, was \"arbitrary\"\nand \"wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality\nbefore the law established by the Constitution.\" Id. at 561-62 (Harlan,\nJ., dissenting).\n\nEarly efforts aimed at combating the injustice wrought by Plessy\nin educational settings often centered on state-funded graduate and\nprofessional schools. See, e.g., Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103109\"><a href=\"/opinion/103109/missouri-ex-rel-gaines-v-canada/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1938); see generally Mark V. Tushnet, The NAACP's\nLegal Strategy Against Segregated Education 1925-1950 (1987). In\nGaines, an African-American student was denied admission to the\nUniversity of Missouri School of Law on account of his race. Mis-\n\n                  76\n\fsouri had no \"separate but equal\" law school for its African-American\ncitizens and instead offered to pay Gaines' tuition and expenses for\na legal education in another state. The Supreme Court held that Mis-\nsouri's offer denied Gaines equal protection of the laws. The Court\nobserved that \"[t]he admissibility of laws separating the races in the\nenjoyment of privileges afforded by the State rests wholly upon the\nequality of the privileges which the laws give to the separated groups\nwithin the State.\" Gaines, 305 U.S. at 349. Though providing only\nsmall victories, cases like Gaines exposed \"separate but equal\" for the\nuntenable proposition that it was.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court recognized the futility of measuring\nequality in segregated facilities.

Board of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954) (Brown I). Presented with a direct attack on Plessy\nin a secondary education case, the Court held that \"segregation of\nchildren in public schools solely on the basis of race\" violated the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Recognizing that segregation differed from\nlocality to locality, the Supreme Court subsequently declined to craft\na broad, one-size-fits-all remedy, and instead instructed the federal\ndistrict courts to oversee the implementation of appropriate relief\nbased on the dictates of local circumstances.

CMS offi-\ncials, however, continued to drag their feet, and the district court was\nforced to appoint its own expert, Dr. John A. Finger, to craft an effi-\ncacious desegregation plan. See Swann v.

The district court conducted eight days\nof hearings and examined five different desegregation plans. The dis-\ntrict court concluded the Finger plan to be the best of the five, encom-\npassing \"a reasonable . . . collection of methods for solving the\nproblem\" of the dual system. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1481032\"><a href=\"/opinion/1481032/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As for busing and the\ncost of new buses, the district court found that the Finger plan took\n\"proper advantage of traffic movement\" and that new buses would\ncost only $660,000, a far cry from the millions of dollars that CMS\nhad originally estimated. See id. at 797-98. Two months later, the\nSupreme Court granted certiorari and undertook an in-depth review\nof the power of the federal district courts to craft such sweeping\ndesegregation remedies. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\nEduc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971).\n\nThe Supreme Court affirmed the desegregation plan adopted by the\ndistrict court, and in the course of its opinion identified and offered\nguidance in \"four problem areas.\" Id. at 22. First, the Court addressed\nthe issue of the district court's use of racial ratios. While the Supreme\nCourt approved of a limited use of mathematical ratios in a plan\ncrafted by a district court, it emphasized that such ratios were \"a start-\ning point . . . rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25. The\nCourt reminded district courts that \"[t]he constitutional command to\ndesegregate schools does not mean that every school in every commu-\nnity must always reflect the racial composition of the school system\n\n                  79\n\fas a whole.\" Id. at 24. Second, the Court dealt with single-race\nschools. Though the Court concluded that schools consisting of pre-\ndominantly one race were not per se unconstitutional, the Court\ninstructed the district courts to utilize \"close scrutiny to determine that\nschool assignments are not part of state-enforced segregation.\" Id. at\n26. Third, the Court considered alterations of attendance zones. The\nCourt held \"that the pairing and grouping of noncontiguous school\nzones is a permissible tool,\" id. at 28, but declined to craft \"rigid\nrules\" in light of differing local circumstances, id. at 29. Finally, the\nCourt tackled the busing issue. The Court confirmed that a district\ncourt could order \"bus transportation as one tool of school desegrega-\ntion,\" but within reasonable time and distance restrictions. Id. at 30.\n\nShortly after the Supreme Court issued its landmark Swann opin-\nion, CMS asked the district court to abandon the Finger plan and per-\nmit the substitution of a \"feeder plan\" whereby schools would draw\npupils from designated attendance areas in an effort to keep children\ntogether for their entire public school career. See Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1428243\"><a href=\"/opinion/1428243/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D.N.C. 1971). Cit-\ning concerns of resegregation and the placement of additional burdens\non African-American children, the district court questioned the feeder\nplan. See id. at 1350-53. CMS then withdrew its original feeder plan\nand began work on a modified version. See id. at 1353. The district\ncourt eventually approved a revised feeder plan that reopened several\nformer black schools and prevented over- and under-utilization of\nfacilities. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 334 F.\nSupp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1971).\n\nHowever, within just two years it became clear that CMS's revised\nfeeder plan was inadequate \"for dealing with foreseeable problems\"\nin the dismantling of the dual system.

Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1449153\"><a href=\"/opinion/1449153/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court found \"that various formerly black schools\nand other schools will turn black under the feeder plan,\" id., and that\n\"[r]acial discrimination through official action has not ended in this\nschool system,\" id. at 1230. The district court again instructed CMS\nto design a new pupil assignment plan \"on the premise that equal pro-\ntection of laws is here to stay.\" Id. at 1238.\n\nIn 1974 CMS adopted and the district court approved new guide-\nlines and policies for pupil assignment. See Swann v. Charlotte-\n\n                  80\n\fMecklenburg Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1378061\"><a href=\"/opinion/1378061/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D.N.C. 1974). The\nplan was designed by a citizens advisory group working with the\nboard in an effort to reach \"an acceptable consensus\" on school deseg-\nregation in CMS. Id. at 1103. The plan's most promising features\nwere the avoidance of any majority black schools (with the exception\nof Hidden Valley, an exempted school), and a more equal distribution\nof the busing burden. See id. at 1105-1110. Praising the board for\nmaking \"a clean break with the essentially `reluctant' attitude which\ndominated Board actions for many years,\" the district court predicted\nthat the policies and positive attitude would eventually result in a uni-\ntary school system. Id. at 1103.\n\nThe district court closed Swann in 1975 and removed the case from\nthe active docket. See Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D.N.C. 1975). In so doing, the district court\nobserved that the board was \"actively and intelligently addressing\"\nrecurrent problems related to dismantlement of the dual system. Id. at\n649. Until the case at bar, the Swann plaintiffs have never attempted\nto reopen the case in order to address any alleged failure by the board\nto comply with the district court's desegregation orders.\n\nThe present litigation arose in September 1997 when William\nCapacchione (\"Capacchione\") filed suit against CMS on behalf of his\ndaughter, Christina, alleging that she had been unconstitutionally\ndenied admission to a magnet school program on account of her race.\nIn 1992, without prior court approval, CMS had adopted a desegrega-\ntion plan focused mainly on the use of magnet schools. In filling mag-\nnet schools, CMS had instituted a black and a non-black lottery to\nachieve racial balance. If a sufficient number of blacks or whites did\nnot apply and fill the seats allotted to their respective races, then CMS\nwould actively recruit children of the desired race despite lengthy\nwaiting lists made up of children of the other race. If the recruitment\ndrive failed, CMS usually left the available slots vacant. Christina,\nwho is white, was placed on a waiting list and eventually denied\nadmission to a program at the Olde Providence magnet school.\n\nThe original Swann plaintiffs moved to reactivate Swann and to\nconsolidate it with Capacchione's suit. They asserted that the vestiges\nof the dual school system had not been abolished and that the use of\nrace in the magnet admissions policy was necessary for the school\n\n                  81\n\fdistrict to comply with the prior desegregation orders. The district\ncourt granted the motion and later permitted Capacchione to intervene\nin the Swann litigation. Seeking a finding that CMS had eradicated\nthe vestiges of past discrimination, another group of parents, led by\nMichael P. Grant (\"Grant\"),1\n                           1 was also permitted to intervene in the lit-\nigation.\n\nAfter a two-month bench trial, the district court determined that\nCMS had achieved unitary status, that the race-based admissions pol-\nicy for CMS's magnet schools fell outside prior orders and was not\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest, and that an\ninjunction was warranted. The district court \"enjoin[ed] CMS from\nany further use of race-based lotteries, preferences, and set-asides in\nstudent assignment.\" Capacchione v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416911/capacchione-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (W.D.N.C. 1999). Citing interests in stability,\nthe district court concluded that the injunction would not affect stu-\ndent assignments for the 1999-2000 school year, but would apply to\nstudent assignments for the 2000-2001 school year. See id. at 292\nn.52. CMS and the Swann plaintiffs filed notices of appeal, and CMS\nmoved to stay the injunction, except as applied to the magnet schools,\nuntil the 2001-02 school year. The Swann plaintiffs moved for a com-\nplete stay pending appeal. On November 15, 1999, the district court\ndenied the motions. CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, pursuant to Fed-\neral Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a)(2), moved this court for a stay.\nOn December 30, 1999, we stayed the district court's injunction pend-\ning further order of this court.\n\nII. Unitary Status\n\nThe district court's unitary status finding is reviewed for clear\nerror. See Riddick v. School Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"465182\"><a href=\"/opinion/465182/paul-r-riddick-jr-and-phelicia-riddick-infants-by-paul-r-riddick/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 533 (4th Cir. 1986);\nFed.

Where there are two permissible views of\n        the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot\n        be clearly erroneous.\n\nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573-74 (1985). The\nSupreme Court also stressed that even when appellate review is based\nprimarily on documentary evidence, the clearly erroneous standard of\nreview remains the same. See id. at 574. So long as the district court's\nunitary status determination rests on a permissible view of the evi-\ndence, it must be affirmed.\n\nThe Supreme Court has declined to define or provide a \"fixed\nmeaning\" for the term \"unitary.\" Freeman v.

The burden of proof falls on the party seeking an end to court\nsupervision. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 494.\n\nIn undertaking a unitary status inquiry, a court must ask \"whether\nthe Board ha[s] complied in good faith with the desegregation decree\nsince it was entered, and whether the vestiges of past discrimination\nha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable.\" Board of Educ. v.\nDowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112520\"><a href=\"/opinion/112520/board-of-ed-of-oklahoma-city-public-schools-v-dowell/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">237</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 249-50 (1991). Implicit in the Supreme Court's\nuse of the term \"practicable\" is \"a reasonable limit on the duration of\n. . . federal supervision.\" Coalition to Save Our Children v. State Bd.\nof Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722543\"><a href=\"/opinion/722543/coalition-to-save-our-children-v-state-board-of-education-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Dowell, 498 U.S.\nat 247 (\"From the very first, federal supervision of local school sys-\ntems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy past discrimina-\ntion.\"). Hence, the goals of a desegregation order not only encompass\na remedy for the violation, but also prompt restoration of local con-\ntrol. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 490 (\"Returning schools to the control\nof local authorities at the earliest practicable date is essential to\nrestore their true accountability in our governmental system. . . .\n\n                  83\n\fWhere control lies, so too does responsibility.\"); Milliken I, 418 U.S.\nat 741-42 (\"No single tradition in public education is more deeply\nrooted than local control over the operation of schools; local auton-\nomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of com-\nmunity concern and support for public schools and to quality of the\neducational process.\").\n\nAmong the most important reference points in determining whether\na school board has fulfilled its duties so that local control may be\nresumed are the factors set out in Green: student assignment, faculty\nassignment, facilities and resources, transportation, staff assignment,\nand extracurricular activities. See Green, 391 U.S. at 435. In its dis-\ncretion, a court conducting a unitary status hearing may consider\nother relevant factors not mentioned in Green. See Freeman, 503 U.S.\nat 492. I address the district court's consideration of each factor in\nturn, but only to determine whether \"the district court's account of the\nevidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\"\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74.\n\nA. Student Assignment\n\nStudent assignment is perhaps the most critical Green factor\nbecause state-mandated separation of pupils on the basis of race is the\nessence of the dual system. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 474 (observing\nthat the issue of student assignment is \"fundamental\" because \"under\nthe former de jure regimes racial exclusion was both the means and\nthe end of a policy motivated by disparagement of . . . the disfavored\nrace\"). To determine whether a school was racially balanced or imbal-\nanced, the district court adopted a plus/minus fifteen percent variance\nfrom the district-wide ratio of black to white students. See Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 246. However, the district court emphasized\n\"that there is no level of compliance with the standard that is determi-\nnative.\" Id. When schools are outside the variance, a \"reasonable and\nsupportable explanation[ ]\" will suffice. Id.\n\nThe plus/minus fifteen percent variance adopted by the district\ncourt was not clearly erroneous. Considering that the only variance\never approved by the district court in the course of the Swann litiga-\ntion was a \"`plus 15%' from the district-wide average,\" id. at 245, the\naddition of a minus fifteen percent is reasonable. Moreover, the\n\n                  84\n\fSupreme Court has permitted a \"limited use . . . of mathematical\nratios\" by district courts, Swann, 402 U.S. at 25, and much higher\nvariances have been used to define desegregation. See Adams v. Wein-\nberger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494490\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494490/adams-v-weinberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

CMS's Compliance Record\n\nThe district court began by observing that since 1970, of the 126\nschools in operation, \"only twenty schools (16%) have had black stu-\ndent bodies higher than 15% above the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years, and only seventeen schools (13%) have had black\nstudent bodies lower than 15% below the district-wide ratio for more\nthan three years.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 248 (footnote omit-\nted). In addition, the district court found that CMS has not operated\na single-race school since 1970. See id.\n\nThe district court also turned to two desegregation indices: the dis-\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2 At trial, Dr. Eric Smith, the current superintendent of CMS, testified\nthat unitary status depended on every school being in balance. See J.A.\nXV-7187 & 7239. This is not the law. See Swann , 402 U.S. at 24 (\"The\nconstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition of\nthe school system as a whole.\").\n\nI find equally erroneous the Swann plaintiffs' assertion at appellate\nargument that \"[t]he issue of how many schools are balanced has never\nbeen a question in this case.\" App. Tr. 91. The racial composition of\nschools goes to the heart of a desegregation case, and is very much key\nto a review of the district court's declaration of unitary status. See\nSwann, 311 F. Supp. at 268 (ordering CMS to assign pupils \"in such a\nway that as nearly as practicable the various schools at various grade\nlevels have about the same proportion of black and white students\").\n\n                   85\n\fsimilarity index and the index of interracial exposure. The former\n\"measures the degree of racial imbalance, and it is derived by com-\nparing the racial composition of each school to the districtwide com-\nposition,\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172, and the latter measures the \"the\naverage percent white in schools attended by black students, weighted\nby the proportion of black students in each school.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,172. According to the report of the plaintiff-intervenors' expert\nwitness, Dr. David J. Armor, a dissimilarity value of twenty or below\nsignifies \"a highly balanced school system\" and a score under thirty\nsignifies \"a substantially desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,172.\nCMS's dissimilarity score was sixteen in 1980 and twenty-six in\n1995. From this it is clear that CMS quickly desegregated in the\n1970s and continues to maintain a \"substantially desegregated sys-\ntem.\" The dissimilarity index also indicates that CMS has better racial\nbalance than several comparable districts did when they were\ndeclared unitary. See J.A. XXXIII-16,173.\n\nThe index of interracial exposure, like the dissimilarity index,\nshows that CMS has made great leaps of progress. A score of zero on\nthe exposure index signifies total segregation, while a score of fifty\nor above indicates a \"highly desegregated system.\" J.A. XXXIII-\n16,172. Schools in CMS typically score above fifty, whereas before\nthe desegregation order the schools' scores hovered near twenty or\nbelow. See J.A. XXXIII-16,194-96.\n\nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs correctly point out that the data sug-\ngest that in recent years racial imbalance has increased in some\nschools. Aware of this trend, the district court made a number of find-\nings on growth and demographic change in the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg area. The most revealing findings are as follows:\n\n       - the county population has increased from 354,656 in\n       1970 to 613,310 in 1997\n\n       - in 1970 the school district was the forty-third largest in\n       the nation and is today the twenty-third largest\n\n       - Among cities with more than 500,000 people, Charlotte\n       ranks second in population growth in the 1990s\n\n                  86\n\f       - the racial composition of the county has changed from\n       seventy-six percent white and twenty-four percent black\n       in 1970 to sixty-eight percent white, twenty-seven per-\n       cent black, and five percent other in 1997\n\n       - the current racial composition of schoolchildren is fifty\n       percent white, forty-two percent black, and eight percent\n       other\n\n       - as the county has become more suburban the inner city\n       and nearby suburbs have lost large numbers of white res-\n       idents as they spread farther out into the formerly rural\n       sections of the county\n\n       - some middle suburban communities that were once all\n       white are now predominately black\n\n       - the rural black population in the southern part of the\n       county has remained relatively constant while the white\n       population has tripled because of suburbanization\n\nSee Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

These finding are sup-\nported by the report of the plaintiff-intervenors' expert in demograph-\nics, Dr. William Clark. See J.A. XXXIII-16230-306. Accordingly, the\ndistrict court concluded that \"[t]here can be no doubt that demography\nand geography have played the largest role in causing imbalance.\"\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Dr. Murphy\ntestified that when he assumed his duties he \"was quite concerned\nabout the increasing difficulty in bringing about racial balance . . .\nbecause of the demographic shifts that were occurring.\" J.A. VI-2712.\nPopulation growth translated into more automobiles on the road, mak-\ning increased busing impracticable because \"the travel time to move\nyoungsters from the suburbs into the city with the flow of rush hour\ntraffic was a problem.\" J.A. VI-2732. In the fall of 1991, CMS hired\nDr. Michael J. Stolee to examine the problem and offer solutions. Dr.\nStolee also concluded that CMS's task \"has been complicated by pop-\n\n                  87\n\fulation growth,\" J.A. XXXII-15,571, and he recommended the adop-\ntion of a magnet schools program, which CMS promptly\nimplemented.\n\nThe Supreme Court has dealt with similar population growth and\nshifting demographics in the context of unitary status. In Freeman,\nthe court unequivocally stated that \"racial imbalance . . . [is] not tanta-\nmount to a showing that the school district [is] in noncompliance with\nthe decree or with its duties under the law.\" 503 U.S. at 494. Brown\nI, of course, does not mandate that racial balance be pursued in perpe-\ntuity. Once the original racial imbalance caused by a constitutional\nviolation has been rectified, \"the school district is under no duty to\nremedy imbalance that is caused by demographic factors.\" Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 494. The Swann plaintiffs contend that consideration of\ndemographics and the rationale of Freeman are misplaced because the\ngrowth and shifting demographics of DeKalb County, Georgia, the\nschool district under court order in Freeman, exceeded that of\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg. While CMS's growth rates and demographic\nshifts certainly do not equal those experienced in DeKalb,3  3 I can find\nnothing in Freeman limiting its holding to the specific facts of\nDeKalb County or establishing DeKalb as the standard for measuring\nimbalance caused by demographic factors. On the contrary, the opin-\nion speaks in general terms. The Supreme Court observed that in the\nUnited States \"it is inevitable that the demographic makeup of school\ndistricts, based as they are on political subdivisions such as counties\nand municipalities, may undergo rapid change.\" Id. at 495. Mobility,\nthe Court noted, \"is a distinct characteristic of our society.\" Id. at 494.\nFreeman cannot be distinguished into nothingness, nor does the stan-\ndard of review permit this court to reweigh the evidence of the\nchanges in CMS.\n\nSimply put, the district court's conclusion that the current imbal-\nance is unrelated to the original constitutional violation is not clearly\nerroneous. Evidence presented at trial indicated that \"[o]f the 16 for-\nmer black schools that are still open, 13 are currently balanced and\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3 For example, the population of DeKalb County grew from 70,000 in\n1950 to 450,000 in 1985, and the percentage of black students in the dis-\ntrict grew from 5.6 percent in 1969 to forty-seven percent in 1986. See\nFreeman, 503 U.S. at 475.\n\n                   88\n\fhave been desegregated for periods ranging from 22 to 28 years. Of\nthe 3 that currently exceed the +15% black variance, each has been\nbalanced for at least 22 years.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Interestingly, of\nthe seventy-two former white schools that are still open, fifteen are\nnow majority black and were in balance for periods of twelve to\ntwenty-five years. See J.A. XXXIII-16,176.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Armor examined the seventeen schools in CMS\nthat exceeded the plus fifteen percent variance for three or more years\nduring the last decade. See J.A. XXXIII-16,174-76.4\n                                                  4 Sixteen of the\nseventeen were balanced for periods ranging from nineteen to twenty-\nsix years, with one school experiencing balance for sixteen years. To\nthe extent that CMS's pupil reassignments could be assessed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that changes instituted by CMS were \"attempts to\nmaintain or restore racial balance in the face of overwhelming demo-\ngraphic growth and mobility.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,176. Indeed, Dr.\nArmor concluded that imbalance had been reduced in several of the\nschools because CMS's magnet program attracted white students\nfrom the outer reaches of the county.\n\nLong periods of almost perfect compliance with the court's racial\nbalance guidelines,5\n                   5 coupled with some imbalance in the wake of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4 Dr. Armor did not include the predominantly white schools in this\nanalysis on three grounds:\n\n        (1) the court order did not establish a minimum percent black\n        enrollment, (2) the half-dozen schools that have had low black\n        enrollment for the past three or more years and that were operat-\n        ing in 1972 have been racially balanced for at least ten years[,]\n        and (3) the demographic analysis of Dr. Clark shows that these\n        schools have become imbalanced or were opened imbalanced\n        because of the substantial white enrollment growth in the out-\n        skirts of the county.\n\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,174 (footnote omitted); see also Swann, 402 U.S. at 26\n(observing \"that the existence of some small number of one-race, or vir-\ntually one-race, schools within a district is not in and of itself the mark\nof a system that still practices segregation by law\").\n\n5 Even the Swann plaintiffs admit that ten years after the district court\ncharged the board with taking affirmative steps to desegregate schools,\nthe system \"w[as] nearly 100% statistically compliant with the court's\norders.\" Plaintiff-Appellants' Brief at 38.\n\n                   89\n\fmassive demographic shifts, strongly supports the district court's\nfinding that the present levels of imbalance are in no way connected\nwith the de jure segregation once practiced in CMS. See Freeman,\n503 U.S. at 495 (\"Where resegregation is a product not of state action\nbut of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications.\").\nThe evidence presented at trial adequately explained why a few\nschools have become imbalanced, and I can discern no evidence or\nomissions that indicate clear error has been committed in this regard.\n\n                   90\n\fVolume 3 of 3\n\n                91\n\f2. Martin and Unitary Status\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs also point to school sitings, transportation\nburdens, and school transfers as evidence that the growing imbalance\nis caused by state action rather than private choices, and that CMS has\nnot complied with the district court's orders in good faith. In advanc-\ning their argument, the Swann plaintiffs rely chiefly on Martin v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1688324\"><a href=\"/opinion/1688324/martin-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Spangler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109519\"><a href=\"/opinion/109519/pasadena-city-bd-of-ed-v-spangler/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1976), and Regents of the University of California v.

In the former case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that\ndistrict courts could not order a school district \"to rearrange its atten-\ndance zones each year so as to ensure that the racial mix desired by\nthe court was maintained in perpetuity,\" Spangler, 427 U.S. at 436,\nand in the latter the Court struck down a medical school admissions\npolicy that reserved sixteen of one hundred seats in the entering class\nfor applicants who were \"`economically and/or educationally disad-\nvantaged'\" and who were members of certain minority groups. Bakke,\n438 U.S. at 274. The district court in Martin distinguished Spangler\nby observing that it was but a restatement of the Swann Court's admo-\nnition about the use of racial quotas and that, unlike Pasadena City,\nCMS had not achieved racially neutral attendance patterns. See Mar-\ntin, 475 F. Supp. at 1340. As for the Bakke decision, the district court\npointed out that no student in CMS was denied \"an equal educational\n\n                  92\n\fopportunity\" and that the admissions policy in Bakke was imple-\nmented \"against a backdrop devoid of specific judicial findings or\nadministrative acknowledgments of the prior segregated status of the\nschool system.\" Id. at 1345. Accordingly, the Martin court concluded\nthat CMS's reassignment of students was \"within constitutional limits\nand should be upheld.\" Id. at 1321. The district court took pains to\nensure that its opinion would not be interpreted too broadly: \"This\norder simply upholds the actions of the 1978 Board against the attacks\nby the plaintiffs.\" Id. at 1347. In the course of the Martin opinion, the\ndistrict court observed that CMS had fallen short in four areas: con-\nstruction and location of facilities in parts of the county likely to\nenhance desegregation, placement of elementary and kindergarten\ngrades in schools throughout the county, monitoring of student trans-\nfers so as to prevent resegregation, and allocation of the burdens of\nbusing. See id. at 1328-29. However, the district court also noted that\nCMS had made great progress and that a return to the old system of\nsegregation \"has not tempted the present School Board, who are\nstanding fast in their endeavor to run the schools according to law\nwhile providing quality education.\" Id. at 1347.\n\nIn Capacchione, the district court correctly observed that \"Martin\nwas not a unitary status hearing,\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The Capacchione court further observed that post-Martin\nchanges in Charlotte-Mecklenburg counseled looking at the \"concerns\n[of Martin] in a new light.\" Id. The district court's interpretation of\nMartin is reasonable and in accord with the rule in this circuit that a\ndistrict court, as a continuous institution, is\"best able to interpret its\nown orders.\" Vaughns v.

Moreover, the Martin order was\nissued thirteen years before the Supreme Court made clear in Free-\nman that the affirmative measures mandated by Green are not meant\nto remedy \"private choices\" that lead to resegregation. Freeman, 503\nU.S. at 495. The state of the law and the understanding of duties upon\nschool districts were far different when Martin was handed down.\nHence, a number of assertions in Martin cannot be squared with the\npresent state of the law. See, e.g., Martin 475 F. Supp. at 1346 (stating\nthat segregated housing patterns must necessarily lead to the unconsti-\ntutional segregation of schools). Ignoring the changes in Charlotte-\n\n                  93\n\fMecklenburg and in the law by erecting Martin as the framework for\nunitary status, as the Swann plaintiffs urged below, would defy com-\nmon sense and run afoul of developments in the Supreme Court's\nschool desegregation jurisprudence.

I will examine the district court's Martin find-\nings in turn.\n\na. School Siting\n\nThe district court found that CMS had not shirked its duties under\nthe law with regard to school sitings. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 251-53. The record reveals that CMS has, to the extent practica-\nble, continually endeavored to site schools in order to foster integra-\ntion, and has adopted a policy of building schools in areas equally\naccessible to blacks and whites. Testimony of current board members\nindicated that in efforts to fulfill this policy, CMS has purchased\nproperty in low growth areas for school construction even though\nschools in predominantly white high growth areas were overcrowded.\nSee J.A. V-1986-87. In 1992 CMS reaffirmed its siting policy and\nresolved that, \"whenever possible,\" new schools would be built in\nareas that would \"provide black student enrollment of not less than 10\npercent from the census tracts serving the new school.\" J.A. XXXII-\n15,686. The impetus behind the resolution was growth in the periph-\nery of the county which the board speculated would continue patterns\nof housing segregation, thus making it more difficult to maintain\nracial balance in the schools. Evidence presented at trial indicated that\nthe ten percent rule was destined for failure because it was not possi-\nble to implement the rule and still \"meet the 60-minute bus ride\nlimit.\" J.A. XXII-10,869. Nevertheless, extensive evidence was pres-\nented showing that CMS never sited schools in order to foster segre-\ngation and that \"every effort was made to try to find school sites that\nwould bring people together in balanced numbers.\" J.A. VI-2752. For\nexample, CMS's executive director of planning and student place-\nment testified that in siting schools CMS \"looked at both African-\nAmerican and all populations not only in the vicinity of the site, but\nin the entire district.\" J.A. VII-2920. So dedicated was CMS to siting\nschools in integrated areas that it contemplated refusing a gift of land\n\n                   94\n\ffor school use because the land was in a predominantly white area.\nSee J.A. V-1985.\n\nFaced with growth in the predominantly white regions of the far\nsouth and north, see J.A. XXXIII-16,261, CMS was compelled to\nserve populations in those areas via school sitings. CMS's data show\nthat in the late 1990s, student population was \"growing at nearly\n4,000 students per year,\" J.A. XXIX-14,133, and consequently the\nboard was \"just trying to keep up\" with the population explosion in\nbuilding schools, J.A. V-2249. Overcrowding was a problem, and in\nthe late 1990s \"the average high school expected to operate at 109\npercent of its capacity.\" J.A. XXIX-14,133. Even though CMS was\nforced to build schools at a rapid rate to serve an expanding student\npopulation, pupil assignment plans in which CMS described popula-\ntion growth as a \"major consideration[ ]\" are replete with efforts to\nimprove racial balance. J.A. XXIX-14,133. For example, the 1997-98\nassignment plan highlighted the creation and expansion of several\nmagnet programs specially designed to reduce the black ratio in a\nnumber of schools. See J.A. XXIX-14,147-51. To the extent practica-\nble, CMS did not sacrifice racial balance concerns to population\ngrowth. Though the two often pulled CMS in different directions, the\nrecord indicates that the board coordinated racial balance and school\nsitings as best it could under the circumstances. The evidence does\nnot indicate that the abandonment of the ten percent rule or other\ndecisions regarding school siting were the result of a desire to perpet-\nuate the dual school system or circumvent the district court's orders.\n\nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs, citing to prior orders, contend that\nthe board has not done all that it could do in the area of school siting.\nErection of such a standard, however, would effectively replace prac-\nticability with possibility. The former implies measures that can be\nreasonably implemented under the circumstances, while the latter\nomits the reasonableness requirement. For instance, it was possible\nfor CMS to adhere to the ten percent rule while ignoring growth in\nthe far north and south of the county. Youngsters would have been\ncompelled to ride buses for long periods while traveling with the flow\nof rush hour traffic, but it was nonetheless possible to adhere to the\nten percent rule. Of course, the practicability of a refusal to respond\nto growth in Charlotte-Mecklenburg is another matter.\n\n                  95\n\fIn the same vein, the Swann plaintiffs contend that school siting\ndecisions were a response to white flight, which is an impermissible\nreason for failing to comply with a desegregation order. Growth, of\ncourse, is far different from flight. And experts offered evidence of\n\"the economic boom in the Charlotte Metropolitan area in the last\ndecade.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,233. Charlotte-Mecklenburg is one of the\nmost dynamic areas in the South; it is far different from the Charlotte-\nMecklenburg of Swann, and much changed from that of Martin. In\nlight of the growth in the county and a plethora of evidence demon-\nstrating that the board used its best efforts to site schools in order to\nfoster integration, the district court did not commit error when it con-\ncluded that there is no \"continuing constitutional violation[ ] in the\narea of school siting.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 253.\n\nb. Burdens of Busing\n\nAs for the burdens of busing, the district court found that in the\nmost recent school year, 15,533 black students and 11,184 non-black\nstudents were bused for balancing purposes. Id. As stated earlier, traf-\nfic patterns make busing suburban students into the inner city far\nmore difficult than busing inner-city children into the suburbs. See\nJ.A. VI-2732; J.A. V-2228. Though a disproportionate number of\nAfrican-American students are bused, the growth and housing pat-\nterns support the district court's conclusion that the realities of the\ncurrent situation should not block a unitary status determination.\n\nc. Student Transfers\n\nFinally, Martin's concern with student transfers appears to have\nbeen based on the assumption that CMS would experience average\ngrowth. Courts are not omniscient, and the district court in 1979 could\nnot have foreseen the changing demographics that would make stu-\ndent transfers the least of CMS's worries. In the present litigation, the\ndistrict court observed \"that CMS `kept an eye on [magnet transfers]\nso that there wouldn't be a run on the bank so to speak from any one\nschool.'\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 250 n.10 (alteration in origi-\nnal). This finding is not clearly erroneous, nor can I discern the need\nfor more findings on this issue in light of post-Martin changes.\n\n                  96\n\f3. Conclusion\n\nIn sum, the district court's findings on student assignment are\n\"plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\" Anderson, 470\nU.S. at 573. The dual system of student assignment in CMS has been\neradicated \"to the extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 250. The\nimbalance existing in some schools is not traceable to the former dual\nsystem or to renewed discriminatory actions, but rather is a result of\ngrowth and shifting demographics. Consequently, I would hold that\nthe district court's findings on student assignment are not clearly erro-\nneous.\n\nB. Faculty Assignment\n\nIn examining faculty assignment, the district again used a\nplus/minus fifteen percent variance. Of the 126 schools operating in\nCMS, the district court found that in 1997-98 only ten schools were\nout of balance. The Swann plaintiffs point out that this number grew\nto sixteen in 1998-99, but this means that a mere twelve percent of\nthe schools were out of balance. This is a far cry from the dual system\nin which \"most of the 24,000 [black students] ha[d] no white teach-\ners.\" Swann, 300 F. Supp. at 1360. There is simply no evidence that\nCMS assigns black teachers to predominantly black schools and white\nteachers to predominantly white schools. Thus, like the majority, I\nbelieve that the district court's conclusion that this Green factor has\nbeen satisfied is not clearly erroneous.\n\nC. Facilities and Resources\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs and CMS contend that the district court\nimpermissibly shifted the burden of proof on this factor. The majority\nagrees with this argument, concluding that the improper allocation of\nthe burden of proof amounts to an error of law and that this issue\ntherefore must be remanded to the district court. I respectfully dis-\nagree.\n\nThis court has previously made clear that \"once a court has found\nan unlawful dual school system, [those alleging the existence of racial\ndisparities] are entitled to the presumption that current disparities are\n\n                  97\n\fcausally related to prior segregation, and the burden of proving other-\nwise rests on the defendants.\" School Bd. of the City of Richmond v.\nBaliles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495020\"><a href=\"/opinion/495020/the-school-board-of-the-city-of-richmond-virginia-lois-harrison-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1311 (4th Cir. 1987). In this case, however,\nthe district court noted that none of the prior orders entered in the\nlong history of the Swann litigation had ever found racial disparities\nto exist with regard to school facilities and concluded that CMS and\nthe Swann plaintiffs bore the burden of establishing discrimination\nwith regard to facilities. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 263 (\"[I]t\nwould defy logic to place now the burden of proof on the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors, requiring them to prove that vestiges of discrimination in\nfacilities have been remedied, when the Court originally found no\nvestiges to exist.\"). In my view, this erroneous assignment of the bur-\nden of proof, which did not affect the manner in which the parties\ntried the case or otherwise prejudice their rights, is harmless and does\nnot undermine the district court's factual conclusions regarding the\nfacilities factor.6\n                  6\n\nImmediately after assigning the burden to CMS and the Swann\nplaintiffs, the district court's order nonetheless summarized and\nweighed the facilities evidence presented by the parties. The district\ncourt carefully analyzed the testimony and report of Dr. Dwayne\nGardner, an expert witness for CMS. Dr. Gardner analyzed seventy-\nthree schools--every identifiably black school in CMS and a sam-\npling of balanced schools and predominantly white schools. Dr. Gard-\nner measured the adequacy, safety, healthfulness, accessibility,\nflexibility, efficiency, expansibility, and appearance of the schools.\nBased on the inspection he grouped schools as follows: \"0-44 (sug-\ngests replacement), 45-59 (needs major improvement), 60-74 (needs\nminor improvement), 75-89 (serves program needs), and 90-100\n(exceptional quality).\" Id. at 264. The survey revealed that of the four\nschools that warranted replacement, two were majority white, and two\nwere imbalanced black. See J.A. XXV-12,182-86. Thirty-four schools\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6 Given the counter-intuitive alignment of the parties in this case, it\ncould be argued that the presumption and burden allocation set forth in\nBaliles should not be applied, and that CMS should instead be required\nto prove the existence of racial disparity in its facilities.

City of Yonkers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764889\"><a href=\"/opinion/764889/united-states-of-america-yonkers-branch-national-association-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309-11 (2d Cir. 1999), vacated\non reh'g, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766833\"><a href=\"/opinion/766833/united-states-of-america-yonkers-branch-national-association-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n                  98\n\ffell into the \"needs major improvement\" category, of which sixteen\nwere imbalanced black and eighteen identifiably white.\n\nThe district court determined that Dr. Gardner's testimony estab-\nlished that any current disparities were functions of the age of the\nfacilities at issue, because\n\n        different building standards apply when a new facility is\n        constructed as compared to when an older facility is reno-\n        vated or upgraded. In other words, the renovation of an\n        older facility usually complies with the code under which\n        the facility was built. Because most facilities in the predomi-\n        nately black inner city are older while facilities in the pre-\n        dominately white suburbs are newer, the inference is that\n        differences in building standards tend to affect black stu-\n        dents disproportionately. This does not amount to racial dis-\n        crimination. Indeed, this practice applies regardless of the\n        racial composition of the school. Thus, older schools that\n        are predominately white--several of which were built in the\n        1920s--are likewise affected by this practice.\n\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 265 (footnote and transcript refer-\nences omitted). Thus, the district court concluded from Dr. Gardner's\ntestimony and report \"that CMS's facilities needs are spread across\nthe system without regard to the racial composition of its schools.\" Id.\n\nThe district court also considered the testimony of CMS's assistant\nsuperintendent of building services, who testified that out of 108\nschools in need of renovations, eighty-one percent were racially bal-\nanced or identifiably white. See J.A. VIII-3810 & 3818. The district\ncourt concluded that this witness's testimony likewise demonstrated\nthat the deficiencies in CMS's facilities were unrelated to the former\nde jure system.\n\nFinally, the court considered CMS's track record in renovating old\nfacilities, praising its practice of allocating funds on a per-pupil basis\nand noting that \"CMS has spent a large portion of[its] bond money\non improving schools in predominantly black areas.\" Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 266.\n\n                   99\n\fAfter an extensive discussion of this evidence, the court made the\nfollowing finding of fact with regard to facilities:\n\n       Just as Judge McMillan found thirty years ago, the Court\n       finds today that inequities in facilities exist throughout the\n       system regardless of the racial makeup of the school. These\n       disparities are generally the result of the relative ages of the\n       facilities, combined with an ongoing lack of funding and the\n       need to accommodate unprecedented growth.\n\nId.\n\nThis finding is clearly determinative of the question of unitary sta-\ntus as to facilities, regardless of which party carried the burden of\nproof. That is, the district court, after carefully considering and\nweighing all the evidence presented on this factor, concluded that any\ndisparity as to the condition of the facilities that might exist was not\ncaused by any intentional discrimination by CMS, but instead was a\nfunction of the age and location of the facilities and the ever-present\nproblem of allocating all too scarce funds. Even if the district court\nhad assigned the burden of proof to the plaintiff-intervenors, this fac-\ntual finding would have compelled a ruling in their favor. In fact, the\ndistrict court acknowledged as much, stating \"that the Plaintiff-\nIntervenors have proven, to the extent possible, the absence of intent\nand causation.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Hollingsworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529277\"><a href=\"/opinion/529277/applewood-landscape-nursery-co-inc-v-wayne-b-hollingsworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1506 (1st Cir. 1989) (conclud-\ning that, if the district court improperly allocated burden of proof on\na particular issue, the error was harmless because the district court's\ndecision on that issue turned on the weight of the evidence in the\nrecord and not on burden of proof rules); cf. Vaughns, 758 F.2d at 992\n(recognizing that an error in shifting the burden of proof in a school\ndesegregation case may be harmless if the record is such that the court\ncan conclude that substantial rights have not been prejudiced).\n\nBecause any error associated with the burden of proof is harmless,\nthe only question that remains is whether the district court's factual\nfindings about the facilities are clearly erroneous. Contrary to the\nmajority's analysis of Dr. Gardner's report and its discussion of \"an-\necdotal accounts of a number of witnesses,\" ante at 40, I simply can-\nnot conclude that the data and other evidence in the record show the\ndistrict court's findings on this Green factor to be implausible. See\nAnderson, 470 U.S. at 574. The majority is certainly correct that \"lies,\ndamned lies, and statistics\" are subject to \"selective culling\" and can\nsupport varying interpretations of the evidence. Ante at 39-40 n.14.\nThe briefs of the parties make this obvious. Though the evidence\ncould have been weighed differently on this factor, \"[w]here there are\ntwo permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice\nbetween them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson, 470 U.S. at\n574. In 1969, the district court found that there was no constitutional\nviolation in the \"quality of school buildings and facilities.\" Swann,\n300 F. Supp. at 1372. The Capacchione court found that this remains\ntrue today, and the evidence as a whole indicates that this finding is\nnot clearly erroneous.\n\nD. Transportation\n\nThe parties do not dispute the district court's finding that \"CMS\nprovides free bus transportation to all students who do not live within\n\n                    101\n\fa mile and a half of their schools.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n267. The focus of the Swann plaintiffs' argument on this factor deals\nwith the Martin opinion. As previously discussed, Martin does not\nprovide the framework for a unitary status determination and the dis-\ntrict court's interpretation of Martin, along with the finding that the\npresent state of busing \"may be about the best CMS can do,\" Capac-\nchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 253, does not constitute error.\n\nE. Staff Assignment\n\nThe district court, noting that findings of discrimination in school\nstaffing were never made, concluded that CMS has complied with its\nconstitutional duties. The parties point this court to no contrary evi-\ndence, nor have I discovered such in the record. Therefore, I concur\nwith the majority that the district court's findings regarding the fifth\nGreen factor are not clearly erroneous.\n\nF. Extracurricular Activities\n\nThe district court concluded that there was no discrimination or\nvestiges of discrimination with regard to extracurricular activities.\nThe evidence presented at trial showed that the ratios of blacks and\nwhites participating in extracurricular activities, though varying\nsomewhat from year to year, is approximately equal. See J.A. XXIV-\n11,634. Areas where there are disparities were not shown to be linked\nto the former dual system. For example, blacks often outnumber\nwhites in holding elective offices in student government, but whites\nhave a higher level of representation in honors programs. No evidence\nis found in the record to indicate that CMS somehow pushes African-\nAmericans toward student government and away from honors pro-\ngrams. In sum, I agree with the majority that the district court's con-\nclusion that CMS has satisfied this Green factor is not clearly\nerroneous.\n\nG. Ancillary Factors\n\n1. Teacher Quality\n\nThe district court found that there was no discrimination in the\nquality of teaching. The Swann plaintiffs contend this finding is\n\n                     102\n\fclearly erroneous because students in imbalanced African-American\nschools are more likely to have inexperienced teachers. This \"experi-\nence gap,\" to the extent it exists, is minuscule. The district court\nfound that \"teachers in imbalanced-black schools had 0.7 to 1.3 fewer\nyears experience than the district averages and had 1.6 to 2.9 fewer\nyears experience than teachers in imbalanced-white schools.\" Capac-\nchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 271. To use middle school teachers as an\nexample, the statistics reveal that the average middle school teacher\nin an imbalanced African-American school had 8.2 years experience\nversus 9.8 years for his counterpart in an imbalanced white school. Id.\nThese numbers clearly support a finding of equality rather than dis-\nparity, and cannot undermine the district court's conclusion on this\nfactor. The district court also pointed to evidence indicating that expe-\nrience does not necessarily relate to competency. For example,\naccording to former Superintendent Murphy, it is not uncommon to\nhave \"excellent first-year teachers\" and \"very weak 35th-year teach-\ners.\" J.A. VI-2795. Other witnesses observed that the newer teachers\nhad better \"knowledge of various teaching strategies\" and were more\ncomfortable with diverse classrooms. J.A. VII-3275.\n\nThe Swann plaintiffs also assert that imbalanced African-American\nschools have fewer teachers with advanced degrees. For instance, in\nimbalanced black high schools only thirty-one percent of the teachers\nheld advanced degrees, while forty-six percent of the teachers in\nimbalanced white high schools held advanced degrees. See Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 271. As it was with teacher experience, testi-\nmony was offered establishing that the number of degrees a teacher\npossesses does not necessarily translate into competence or quality\ninstruction. See J.A. VII-3276. According to former Superintendent\nMurphy, \"the degree level was not a significant indicator of getting\nbetter performance on the part of the teacher.\" J.A. VI-2795. Expert\nreports submitted by the plaintiff-intervenors also indicated that there\nis \"no significant relationship\" between black achievement and\nteacher education levels. J.A. XXXIII-16,221. In sum, I agree with\nthe majority that the district court's conclusion that African-American\nstudents receive equal access to quality teachers is not clearly errone-\nous.\n\n2. Student Achievement\n\nThe district court found that the existence of an achievement gap\nbetween black and white students was not a vestige of the dual system\n\n                  103\n\for evidence of discrimination in the current operation of CMS. This\nwas an area of immense disagreement at trial, and the parties\npresented a mountain of data on this subject. Though the Fourteenth\nAmendment guarantees equal protection but not equal outcomes, if\nlow African-American achievement is a result of the former de jure\nsystem, it must be eliminated to the extent practicable. See Dowell,\n498 U.S. at 249-50. Conversely, to the extent that low achievement\nis linked to other factors, it is beyond the reach of the court's author-\nity. Most courts of appeals confronting this issue, including this court,\nhave declined to consider the achievement gap as a vestige of dis-\ncrimination or as evidence of current discrimination. See Baliles, 829\nF.2d at 1313 (upholding lower court's findings that low achievement\nis \"primarily attributable to the high incidence of poverty\" in the\nschool district); see also, United States v. City of Yonkers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766833\"><a href=\"/opinion/766833/united-states-of-america-yonkers-branch-national-association-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (2d Cir. 1999) (observing that \"using achievement test scores\nas a measure, either direct or indirect, of a school system's movement\naway from segregation is deeply problematic\"); People Who Care v.\nRockford Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739713\"><a href=\"/opinion/739713/people-who-care-plaintiffs-appelleescross-appellants-v-rockford-board-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 (7th Cir. 1997) (explaining\nthat a number of variables, other than discrimination, account for the\nachievement gap); Coalition to Save Our Children, 90 F.3d at 778\n(finding \"a causal link between . . . socioeconomic factors and student\nachievement\").\n\nThe plaintiff-intervenors' expert witness, Dr. Armor, presented evi-\ndence indicating that there is no correlation between African-\nAmerican performance and the racial balance of schools. See J.A.\nXXXIII-16,178. For example, Dr. Armor's studies showed that\nAfrican-American students in the third through fifth grades attending\nschools sixteen to twenty-five percent African-American scored the\nsame on standardized tests as their counterparts in schools seventy-\nfive percent black or greater. See J.A. at 16,214. Similarly, African-\nAmerican students in the sixth through eighth grades attending\nschools sixteen percent black or less scored the same on standardized\ntests as their counterparts in schools seventy-five percent black or\ngreater. See J.A. XXXIII-16,215.\n\nIn order to shed light on the true causes of the achievement gap,\nDr. Armor turned to socioeconomic factors. The data revealed star-\ntling differences between black and white children in CMS.\n\n                  104\n\f        Average black family income is $31,000 compared to\n        $59,000 for whites, and only 15 [percent] of black parents\n        are college graduates, compared to 58 percent for white par-\n        ents. A huge poverty gap is also revealed, with 63 percent\n        of black students on free lunch compared to only 9 percent\n        of white students. Finally, 83 percent of white students have\n        both parents at home, compared to only 42 percent for black\n        students.\n\nJ.A. XXXIII-16,179. According to Dr. Armor, the socioeconomic fac-\ntors plus the second grade scores, which are the earliest available,\nexplain \"nearly 80 percent of the reading gap and over 70 percent of\nthe math gap.\" J.A. XXXIII-16,180. Former Superintendent Murphy\nalso testified that in his experience \"[p]oor students come behind and\nstay that way. And in Charlotte, a majority of poor students happen\nto be African-American.\" J.A. VI-2696. Dan Saltrick, former assistant\nsuperintendent for instructional services, also testified that in his\nexperience low student test scores related to parental support which\nin turn was \"a matter of . . . socioeconomic levels.\" J.A. VII-3280.\nWhile socioeconomic disparities between black and white pupils are\ntroubling, they are not the result of CMS's actions or inactions and\ntherefore are beyond the scope of the original desegregation order.\nSee Baliles, 829 F.2d at 1314 (\"Educational deficiencies that result\nfrom problems such as poverty are best remedied by programs\ndirected toward eliminating poverty, not by indirect solutions through\nschool programs.\").8 8 Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err\nin finding that the achievement gap between black and white students\nis not a vestige of past discrimination or evidence of present discrimi-\nnation.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8 Despite evidence that the achievement gap results from factors out-\nside CMS's control, the district court found that CMS has undertaken\nsundry measures to eliminate the gap. For example, CMS adopted finan-\ncial incentives for teachers and principals tied to student performance,\nurged black students to take advanced placement and other higher level\nclasses, challenged all students by removing \"fluff courses\" from the cur-\nriculum, provided tutors and other forms of staff support to accelerate\nstudent preparedness, and adopted pre-kindergarten programs to acceler-\nate preparedness for the youngest of students. See Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 273-275.\n\n                   105\n\f3. Student Discipline\n\nThe district court found \"that any disparities that exist in the area\nof discipline are not causally related to the dual system.\" Capacch-\nione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 281. In none of the court's prior orders is there\nany indication that CMS has ever discriminated in meting out punish-\nment for disruptive students. However, recent statistics show that of\nthe 13,206 students disciplined from 1996-98, sixty-six percent were\nAfrican-American. See J.A. XXIV-11,637. As the district court noted,\n\"disparity does not, by itself, constitute discrimination.\" Capacchione,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 281. The idea that CMS should have a disciplinary\nquota is patently absurd, and there is no evidence in the record that\nCMS targets African-American students for discipline. Instead, the\nevidence indicates that CMS has adopted guidelines whereby students\nreceive the same level of punishment for certain offenses to ensure\nthat the amount of punishment will not vary from school to school.\nA student charged with a disciplinary infraction may also appeal the\ncharge \"and may assert that the charge was due to racial bias.\" Id.\nThere is simply no evidence in the record that CMS treats African-\nAmerican students differently in disciplinary matters. Hence, the dis-\ntrict court's conclusion that the disciplinary disparities are unrelated\nto the former de jure system is not clearly erroneous.\n\nH. Good Faith\n\nLastly, the district court found that CMS has complied with the\ndesegregation decree in good faith. See Freeman, 503 U.S. at 491\n(requiring school board \"to demonstrate its good-faith commitment to\na constitutional course of action\"). Seven factors supported the district\ncourt's good-faith finding: (1) no further relief has been sought since\nthe district court removed the case from the active docket in 1975; (2)\nCMS has gone above and beyond the court's orders by continually\nstriving to achieve balance even when the imbalance was uncon-\nnected to the dual system; (3) the board has been open to community\ninput and sought community support for its integrative efforts; (4) the\nboard has repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to desegregation\nthrough various resolutions; (5) African-Americans currently occupy\nfour of the nine seats on the school board, including the chair; (6) the\nboard's actions over the past thirty years do not evince discriminatory\nmotives; and (7) \"no evidence has been presented that school authori-\n\n                  106\n\fties were guilty of easily correctable errors.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 282-83.\n\nTestimony from former board members indicated that the court's\norder has been \"institutionalized,\" J.A. V-2222, and that the board \"al-\nways stuck to what the rules were.\" J.A. V-2234. Former Superinten-\ndent Murphy testified that when he arrived in Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhe found a \"unique\" environment where \"everybody wanted to make\nsure that their schools were racially balanced.\" J.A. VI-2686. In 1992,\nDr. Stolee suggested a magnet plan to increase integration, and, in the\ncourse of his recommendations, observed that \"[f]or the last twenty\nyears, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education and the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg community have, in good faith, complied\nwith the orders of the court.\" J.A. XXXII-15,570. He further observed\n\"that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board and community have a great\ndeal of pride in the fact that they successfully met a challenge and\nmade the solution work.\" J.A. XXXII-15,571.\n\nOf course, both in the district court and in appellate arguments,\ncurrent CMS officials engaged in much self-recrimination, described\nby the majority as \"frank acquiescence in a position inuring to [their]\ndetriment.\" Ante at 34. The district court gave little weight to CMS's\nassertions that the board had not put forth enough effort, and the evi-\ndence presented at trial amply supports the district court in this\nregard. Former Superintendent Murphy testified that despite a report\nindicating that CMS was unitary and his belief that CMS \"w[as] defi-\nnitely in compliance,\" no effort was made to dissolve the court order.\nJ.A. VI-2706. Dr. Murphy gave three reasons for the avoidance of a\nunitary status hearing. First, he advised board members that the court\nhearing would be \"a long, drawn-out process which would cost mil-\nlions of dollars, and that would be money taken away from the\ninstructional program.\" J.A. VI-2706. Second, Dr. Murphy feared that\nif CMS was declared unitary \"we would not be eligible for federal\nfunding for our magnet schools.\" J.A. VI-2706. Finally, Dr. Murphy\nthought it best to remain under court order so CMS could continue to\nracially balance schools even though the de jure violation had been\nremedied.\n\nDr. Susan Purser, the current associate superintendent of education\nservices of CMS, expressed a similar desire for CMS to remain under\n\n                  107\n\fcourt order. Though Dr. Purser testified that she believed that the\nschool board, superintendent, and administration were dedicated to\nenhancing educational opportunities for all of CMS's students regard-\nless of race, she nonetheless expressed a preference for court supervi-\nsion. Dr. Purser pointed out that the current \"Board has only a limited\ntime, because these are elected positions,\" J.A. XVII-8076, and that\nover time \"superintendents will change, [and] the people involved in\n[CMS] will change.\" J.A. XVII-8077. At this point in the cross exam-\nination, counsel asked Dr. Purser: \"But you don't know what any\nfuture School Board or administration will do either way, do you?\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser responded: \"That's exactly my point.\"\nJ.A. XVII-8077. Dr. Purser's testimony and that of Dr. Murphy exem-\nplify why the Supreme Court has stressed that \"federal supervision of\nlocal school systems was intended as a temporary measure to remedy\npast discrimination.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 247; see also Coalition to\nSave Our Children, 90 F.3d at 761 n.6 (warning of \"the potential for\nthe entrenchment of [a] putatively transitional desegregation\nscheme\"). The district court's desegregation order was not intended\nto continue after CMS remedied the de jure violation, nor was it\nintended to suspend the democratic process with no prospect of resto-\nration. Yet it has been institutionalized to the point that CMS officials\ncannot imagine life without it. Contrary to assertions of the majority,\nthe desegregation order is certainly not viewed as \"detrimental\" by\nCMS officials. See ante at 34.\n\nIronically, CMS's clinging to the temporary desegregation order\nbuttresses the district court's finding that it is unlikely \"CMS would\nreturn to an intentionally-segregative system.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. at 284. If CMS will go to such lengths to keep the court's order\nin place so that it may continue racial balancing and other policies,\nit is unthinkable that CMS will attempt to revive the dual system.\nAccordingly, the district judge's finding of good faith is not clearly\nerroneous.\n\nI. CMS's Remedial Plan\n\nAs a response to the plaintiff-intervenors' push for unitary status,\nCMS developed a remedial plan addressing many of the Green factors\nand other ancillary factors. See J.A. XXIII-11,028. The district court\ndismissed the remedial plan as a \"`litigation strategy' plan\" and\n\n                  108\n\fdeclined to consider it. Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 256. The\nmajority, in reversing the unitary status determination, describes the\ndistrict court's treatment of the remedial plan as\"a fundamental flaw\nin the district court's proceedings.\" Ante at 24. First, the majority\navers that the district court misconstrued the test for unitary status.\nAccording to the majority, a district court must ask (1) what a school\ndistrict has done in the past, and (2) what a school district may do in\nthe future. See ante at 25. Because the district court allegedly failed\nto undertake the latter inquiry as to the remedial plan, the majority\nholds that the district court's order must be reversed. The majority\ndivines its two-part test from Supreme Court cases which have\ninstructed district courts to ask \"whether the Board ha[s] complied in\ngood faith with the desegregation decree since it was entered, and\nwhether the vestiges of past discrimination ha[ve] been eliminated to\nthe extent practicable.\" Dowell, 498 U.S. at 249-50; see also Free-\nman, 503 U.S. at 491.\n\nWhile I agree with my colleagues on the first prong of their test,\nI do not agree that examining \"whether the vestiges of past discrimi-\nnation ha[ve] been eliminated to the extent practicable,\" Dowell, 498\nU.S. at 249-50, requires a district court--as a matter of law--to con-\nsider a remedial plan conceived, drafted, and offered by one of the\nparties during the lawsuit as an obvious defense to it. The plain mean-\ning of the relevant language is that in some desegregation cases sim-\nple compliance with the court's orders is not enough for meaningful\ndesegregation to take place. See Swann, 402 U.S. at 25 (stating that\n\"a district court's remedial decree is to be judged by its effective-\nness\"). For example, a decree entered in the 1960s or 1970s could\nhave underestimated the extent of the remedy required, or changes in\nthe school district could have rendered the decree obsolete. In either\ncase, a district court must look beyond mere compliance with the\noriginal decree and ask whether the vestiges of the dual system have\nbeen eliminated to the extent practicable. In the present case, the dis-\ntrict court undertook such an inquiry. Not only did the district court\naddress compliance, but it also looked beyond the original decree and\nexamined how the extensive changes in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\narea have affected the dismantling of the former dual system. Hence,\nI do not believe that Dowell and Freeman required the district court\nas a matter of law to have considered CMS's eleventh-hour remedial\nplan.\n\n                  109\n\fLikewise, I do not believe that the district court ran afoul of Fed-\neral Rule of Evidence 402 when it refused to consider the remedial\nplan. Rule 402, of course, declares that \"[a]ll relevant evidence is\nadmissible.\" Even relevant evidence may be excluded, however, when\nits probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of\nthe needless presentation of cumulative evidence. See Fed. R. Evid.\n403. And CMS's remedial plan was certainly cumulative, citing and\nsummarizing several expert reports which had been admitted into evi-\ndence. For example, the plan's discussion of faculty assignment is\nbased on the reports of Dr. William Trent, Dr. Robert Peterkin, and\nDr. Roslyn Mickelson; the plan's discussion of facilities is based on\nDr. Gardner's report; the plan's discussion of the achievement gap\nbetween blacks and whites is based on the reports of Dr. Trent, Dr.\nPeterkin, and Dr. Mickelson; and the plan's student assignment dis-\ncussion is based on Dr. Gordon Foster's report. All of the aforemen-\ntioned reports were admitted into evidence and the authors of the\nreports testified at the hearing and were subject to cross-examination.\nHence, much of the remedial plan was cumulative, providing the dis-\ntrict court with but a rehashing of expert reports and testimony.\n\nTo the extent that the remedial plan contained relevant evidence\nappearing nowhere else in the record, I would hold that the exclusion\nof such evidence was harmless. According to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 61, a \"court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard\nany error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the sub-\nstantial rights of the parties.\" Listing myriad deficiencies, objectives,\nand strategies, the thirty-one page remedial plan is often short on spe-\ncifics. Considering the amount of evidence presented on every aspect\nof CMS's operations during other phases of the two-month bench\ntrial, I cannot hold that the exclusion of the remedial plan affected\nCMS's substantial rights. See Ingram Coal Co. v.

Because the exclu-\nsion of the remedial plan in no way renders the judgment below sus-\npect, the district court's treatment of the plan cannot support reversal.\n\nIII. Magnet Schools\n\nI turn now to Capacchione's challenge to CMS's 1992 magnet\nschools plan. Specifically, Capacchione contends that his daughter\n\n                  110\n\fChristina was unconstitutionally denied admission to a magnet school\nprogram on account of her race.\n\nAs noted previously, CMS operated its schools in nearly perfect\nracial balance for almost twenty years under a pupil assignment plan,\nadopted by the board and approved by the district court in 1974,\nwhich primarily utilized \"optional schools,\" paired elementary\nschools, satellite attendance zones, and a feeder system. In 1991,\nhowever, CMS hired Dr. Stolee to examine racial imbalance that was\nbeing caused anew by the demographic shifts and population growth\nin the City of Charlotte and surrounding Mecklenburg County and, in\n1992, implemented a new pupil assignment plan drafted by Dr.\nStolee, entitled \"CMS Student Assignment Plan: A New Generation\nof Excellence.\" This new plan emphasized the use of magnet schools,\nwhich would allow CMS to phase out the more unpopular paired ele-\nmentary schools. Magnet schools, many of which were located in pre-\ndominately black neighborhoods, offered a specialized curriculum or\ninnovative instructional style not found in the other schools in the sys-\ntem.\n\nFormer Superintendent Murphy oversaw implementation of the\nStolee plan and testified that the magnet program was adopted\nbecause CMS \"wanted to attract more white youngsters into the inner\ncity schools\" in order to meet CMS's racial-balance goals. J.A. VI-\n2709. Dr. Stolee observed in his report that \"Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nhas had a long and successful experience with mandatory school\nassignments,\" but that in order to combat demographic shifts CMS\nshould adopt a plan based on voluntarism. J.A. XXXII-15,581; see\nalso Missouri v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 92 (1995) (Jenkins III)\n(\"Magnet schools have the advantage of encouraging voluntary move-\nment of students within a school district in a pattern that aids desegre-\ngation on a voluntary basis, without requiring extensive busing and\nredrawing of district boundary lines.\"). A desegregation plan using\nmagnet schools, according to Dr. Stolee, would \"give[ ] each parent\nan opportunity to make a choice between a school serving the area in\nwhich the family resides, a school in some other area, or a school\noffering a very specific attractive program.\" J.A. XXXII-15,580. Dr.\nStolee also recognized that the magnet-centered plan would be a dra-\nmatic shift from the prior desegregation plan. Thus, as part of the\nplan, he recommended that CMS secure approval from the district\n\n                  111\n\fcourt before making any changes. Indeed, Dr. Stolee's \"RECOM-\nMENDATION #1,\" out of forty-four, read:\n\n        THE SCHOOL BOARD, THROUGH LEGAL COUNSEL,\n        SHOULD APPROACH THE FEDERAL COURT TO\n        SECURE APPROVAL TO CHANGE THE COURT-\n        ORDERED DESEGREGATION PLAN.\n\nJ.A. XXXII-15,578. This recommendation was consistent with the\nprior district court order directing CMS to apply to the district court\n\"before making any material departure\" from the approved desegrega-\ntion plan. Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 270. However, CMS ignored Dr.\nStolee's advice and the district court's instruction, choosing instead\nto withhold these changes in the desegregation plan from the district\ncourt.\n\nThe crux of the problem with CMS's magnet school plan is its\nadmissions process. As aptly described by the district court, it oper-\nates as follows:\n\n        At the start of the process, CMS first fills seats with prefer-\n        ences based on whether the applicant lives in close proxim-\n        ity to the school and whether the applicant has any siblings\n        in the school. CMS then fills the remaining seats by select-\n        ing students from a black lottery and a non-black lottery\n        until the precise racial balance is achieved.\n\nCapacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 287 (internal citations omitted). Seek-\ning a balance of sixty percent white and forty percent black in the\nmagnet schools, CMS decreed in its 1992 student assignment plan\nthat magnet \"slots reserved for one race will not be filled by students\nof another race.\" J.A. XXXII-15,702. The result of this policy was\nthat if a sufficient number of blacks or whites did not apply and fill\nthe seats allotted to their respective races, then those seats would be\nleft vacant. Though some exceptions were made, Superintendent Eric\nSmith testified that CMS generally adhered to the policy. See J.A.\nXV-7217.\n\nThe district court appropriately examined the magnet schools\nthrough a pre-unitary status lens, observing \"that the current litigation\n\n                   112\n\fstarted not as a petition for unitary status but as a discrimination suit\narising out of Christina Capacchione's denial of admission to a mag-\nnet school based on her race.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court then subjected\nthe admissions policy to strict scrutiny, holding that the policy vio-\nlated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nbecause it was not narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling state\ninterest of remedying past discrimination. I would affirm.\n\nA. Immunity\n\nI begin with the question of whether the CMS officials are entitled\nto immunity because their actions in adopting and implementing the\nStolee magnet program in 1992 were taken pursuant to and were con-\nsistent with the desegregation orders and opinions issued by the dis-\ntrict court and Supreme Court in the early 1970s. CMS asserts that it\nis entitled to immunity for its act of implementing the 1992 magnet\nschools program without court approval because the prior desegrega-\ntion orders authorized the use of \"optional schools\" and a racial bal-\nance goal for filling them. Like the district court, I conclude that the\nmagnet schools plan, as implemented, was not authorized by the prior\ncourt orders and that, for the reasons stated hereafter, the CMS offi-\ncials are not entitled to immunity.\n\n                  113\n\fIn 1970, the district court issued a desegregation order to CMS,\nnoting that the order was \"not based upon any requirement of `racial\nbalance.'\" Swann, 311 F. Supp. at 267 (emphasis added). The court\nreiterated \"that efforts should be made to reach a 71-29 ratio in the\nvarious schools so that there will be no basis for contending that one\nschool is racially different from the others, but [recognized] that vari-\nations from the norm may be unavoidable.\" Id. at 267-68 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The district court also gave CMS wide dis-\ncretion in implementing the desegregation measures by \"encourag-\n[ing] [CMS officials] to use their full`know-how' and resources to\nattain\" the desired results. Id. at 269. However, the district court con-\ncurrently warned that this \"maximum discretion . . . to choose meth-\nods that will accomplish the required result\" was not limitless,\ndirecting the board to obtain leave of court \"before making any mate-\nrial departure from any specific requirement set out\" in the order. Id.\nat 270. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the district court's\ndecision and also addressed the subject of racial quotas. See Swann,\n402 U.S. at 23-25. Specifically, with regard to the district court's goal\nof achieving a racial balance of seventy-one percent white and\ntwenty-nine percent black, the Court took care to note that \"[t]he con-\nstitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every\nschool in every community must always reflect the racial composition\nof the school system as a whole\" and that had the district court \"re-\nquire[d], as a matter of substantive constitutional right, any particular\ndegree of racial balance or mixing, that approach would be disap-\nproved and we would be obliged to reverse.\" Swann, 402 U.S. at 24.\nThe goal was upheld, however, because the \"use made of mathemati-\ncal ratios was no more than a starting point in the process of shaping\na remedy, rather than an inflexible requirement.\" Id. at 25.\n\nIn 1974, the district court approved new guidelines and policies\nadopted by the board, which included the use of \"optional schools.\"\nSwann, 379 F. Supp. at 1103-04. These optional schools placed more\n\"emphasis on open or traditional education than normally offered in\nconventional schools.\" J.A. XXXII-15,683. The optional schools' tra-\nditional programs \"offer[ed] an enriched and highly structured educa-\ntion,\" J.A. XXXII-15,732, whereas the open programs offered a\n\"student-centered\" environment that \"encouraged [students] to take\nresponsibility for their behavior and for their own learning.\" J.A.\nXXXII-15,733. The optional schools approved by the 1974 order\n\n                  114\n\fwere far from being as diverse and specialized as the magnet school\nprogram implemented in 1992. The program suggested by Dr. Stolee\noffered schools specializing in traditional and open educational meth-\nods and created specialized curriculum schools featuring the Montes-\nsori method; science, mathematics, and technology; foreign language\nimmersion; learning immersion programs for young children;\nenhanced education for academically gifted students; and communi-\ncation studies programs. See J.A. XXXII-15730-41. However, both\nthe optional schools and the magnet schools were designed to achieve\nthe same end result--to attract students to a school in a particular\nlocation by using a specialized curriculum or teaching technique.\nThus, Dr. Stolee, in recommending the magnet program in 1992,\nobserved that CMS, via its optional schools, \"had some experience in\nsuch specialized schools.\" J.A. XXXII-15,580.\n\nConsistent with the district court's 1971 ruling that a flexible goal\nbe set for individual schools, the district court also approved an\noptional schools admissions policy which provided that \"optional\nschool enrollments will be controlled starting with 1974 so that they\nare open to all county residents and have about or above 20% black\nstudents,\" Swann, 379 F. Supp. at 1104, and recognized that the \"ac-\ntual enrollment of the optional school may have to be guided by its\nracial composition and by the number drawn from each other school\narea, not by considerations of space and program only,\" id. at 1108.\nAdditionally, the policy directed that \"[r]eassignments to optional\nschools must not jeopardize the racial composition of any other\nschool.\" Id. These modifications, however, at no time set a racial\nquota or ratio of the type disapproved of by the district court in its\nearlier orders and by the Supreme Court in its 1971 review of the dis-\ntrict court's 1970 order.99\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9 I respectfully disagree with the assertion that the Supreme Court's\ndisapproval of inflexible racial quotas as a desegregation tool is solely\na limitation on a district court's remedial power, and that school authori-\nties may impose such rigid racial quotas to remedy the identical wrong.\nIn Swann, the Court addressed the authority of the district court to\nimpose rigid racial quotas, but did not explicitly address the issue of\nwhether school authorities could do so. Swann, 402 U.S. at 24-25. The\nsame day, however, the Court struck down a state anti-busing law\nbecause it \"flatly forb[ade] assignment of any student on account of race\n\n                  115\n\fFinally, despite the district court's 1970 directive that CMS obtain\ncourt approval for material modifications to the court-imposed deseg-\nregation plan, the approval process that took place in the ensuing\nyears, and Dr. Stolee's specific recommendation that CMS seek court\napproval for the new magnet schools program in 1992, CMS inexpli-\ncably chose not to return to the district court to obtain approval of the\nmagnet schools program and its strict admissions process. Conse-\nquently, the district court was never given the opportunity to rule\nupon its permissibility as a desegregation tool prior to its implementa-\ntion and CMS was never required by court order to implement it.\n\nNevertheless, I recognize that magnet schools are frequently used\nby school districts under a desegregation order. See Milliken v. Brad-\nley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272 (1977) (Milliken II) (approving of magnet\nschools as a desegregation tool). Indeed, the plaintiff-intervenors'\nown expert has touted magnet programs as an \"effective way to attract\nsizable numbers of white students to predominately minority\nschools.\" David J. Armor, Forced Justice: School Desegregation and\nthe Law 223 (1995). Thus, a magnet schools program, properly imple-\nmented, can no doubt be an effective desegregation tool. However, a\nconclusion that CMS was free to adopt any form of magnet school\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nor for the purpose of creating a racial balance or ratio in the schools.\"\nNorth Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v. Swann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108319\"><a href=\"/opinion/108319/north-carolina-bd-of-ed-v-swann/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (1971).\nThis time addressing race-based assignments as a tool available to\n\"school authorities . . . to fulfill[ ] their constitutional obligation to elimi-\nnate existing dual school systems,\" the Court reiterated Swann's distinc-\ntion between unacceptable rigid quotas and acceptable quotas used as\n\"starting points in shaping a remedy.\" Id. at 46.\n\nCommon sense likewise compels me to reject the view that Swann for-\nbids courts to impose inflexible quotas, but sanctions the identical action\nby school authorities. Under such a reading of Swann, school authorities\nwould be at liberty to implement programs to remedy the effects of seg-\nregation which the district court would be prohibited from ordering for\nthe identical remedial purpose. However, whether imposed by a court\nupon a recalcitrant school board or voluntarily adopted by a school board\nto meet the requirements of Brown and Green, the constitutional implica-\ntions are the same. Even when intended to serve a permissible remedial\npurpose, unduly rigid race-based assignments exceed permissible limits\nof race-based remedial action.\n\n                   116\n\fprogram it might wish to see in place does not flow from this general\nproposition.\n\nNor do I find authorization for CMS's actions in the language of\nthe prior court orders which CMS points to for support of its immu-\nnity argument. At most, the portions of the district court order autho-\nrizing \"optional schools\" could perhaps be read in isolation as\nauthorizing CMS's use of \"magnet schools\" in more diverse, special-\nized areas, although I would still have difficulty excusing CMS's fail-\nure to seek the requisite prior court approval for such a material\nexpansion. I need not resolve this closer question, however, because\nCMS's program went much further than simply expanding the num-\nber and types of specialized schools, be they called \"optional\" or\n\"magnet.\" Under no circumstances could I accept CMS's assertion\nthat the inflexible racial quotas mandated by the expanded magnet\nschool program was countenanced by the prior court orders. The\noptional school order, relied on by CMS, required school officials to\nstrive for a minimum level of twenty percent black enrollment in\noptional schools. The same order required CMS to ensure that\noptional schools did not jeopardize the desegregation of other schools.\nBut the prior orders did not approve a use of race to the extent that\nCMS could deny eager applicants an otherwise available slot in a\nmagnet program solely on account of the applicant's race. On the con-\ntrary, both the district court and the Supreme Court in this very case\nconsistently rejected the use of such rigid racial quotas.\n\nI also find no authorization for the board's adoption of the magnet\nschools program in the Supreme Court's 1971 approval in Swann of\na majority-to-minority transfer policy that would prevent, for exam-\nple, an African-American child in a majority white school from trans-\nferring to a majority black school because the transfer would increase\nthe degree of segregation in the affected schools. See Swann, 402 U.S.\nat 26. Because the majority-to-minority transfer policy, like the mag-\nnet admissions policy, prevents a child from enrolling in the public\nschool of his choice, the majority concludes that the magnet admis-\nsions policy is permissible. By definition, however, CMS's special-\nized magnet programs are not tantamount to conventional public\nschools. While a child denied a transfer from one conventional school\nto another still receives the same general education, a child denied\nadmission to a specialized magnet program does not receive a similar\n\n                  117\n\fbenefit in a conventional school. In other words, an education in a\nmagnet school offering, for example, foreign language immersion, is\nnot interchangeable with an education in a conventional public school.10\n                                                                       10\nHence, the effect of the magnet admissions policy is far different from\nthe majority-to-minority transfer policy.\n\nThe end result of the challenged magnet schools admissions policy\nis placement of racial quotas ahead of educating students--an inap-\npropriate result nowhere countenanced in the district court's orders or\nin the Supreme Court's desegregation decisions.

Council\nof the City of Emporia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108587\"><a href=\"/opinion/108587/wright-v-council-of-emporia/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463 (1972) (holding that courts\nshould not approve a desegregation plan if the plan offers \"`quality\neducation' to some children, [but] has a substantial adverse effect\nupon the quality of education available to others\"). In fact, Brown I\nstruck down segregated schooling because children were denied equal\neducational opportunities. See Brown I, 347 U.S. at 493. While school\nboards were permitted to use race in assigning students in order to\nconvert to a unitary system, see North Carolina State Bd. of Educ. v.\nSwann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108319\"><a href=\"/opinion/108319/north-carolina-bd-of-ed-v-swann/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (1971) (holding that the use of race in pupil\nassignments is \"one tool absolutely essential to fulfillment of [a\nschool board's] constitutional obligation to eliminate existing dual\nschool systems\"), the Brown opinions never contemplated that this\nremedial use of race, like the old dual system, would deny some stu-\ndents educational opportunities solely because of their race. See\nBrown I, 347 U.S. at 493 (holding that an educational opportunity\nprovided by the state \"must be made available to all on equal terms\");\nsee also Bakke, 438 U.S. at 305 (Powell, J.)

Magnet schools, on the other hand, are\na completely different animal and therefore the admissions process used\nmust be more closely scrutinized.\n\n11 Though the present case was brought on behalf of a white child\ndenied admission to a magnet school, the policy as written could have\n\n                  118\n\fable, unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child,\nwhether black or white, on account of the child's race cannot be\nsquared with the district court's orders or the Supreme Court's deseg-\nregation decisions. It is improper to attempt to establish equal protec-\ntion of the laws in the realm of public education by denying children\nan equal opportunity to compete for open, unclaimed slots in CMS's\nextraordinary magnet schools. I agree with the district court that the\npolicy is ultra vires and that CMS officials are not entitled to immu-\nnity.\n\nB. Equal Protection\n\nHaving determined that the CMS officials are not entitled to immu-\nnity for the implementation of the strict race-based magnet school\nassignment policy, I now turn to the question of whether the officials'\nact of implementing the policy without prior court approval, albeit\nwhile under an order to desegregate schools, runs afoul of the Equal\nProtection clause. I conclude that it does.\n\nUnder the Fourteenth Amendment, \"[n]o State shall . . . deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S.\nConst. amend. XIV, § 1. By guaranteeing equal protection, the\nAmendment recognizes that \"[d]istinctions between citizens solely\nbecause of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free peo-\nple whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\"\nHirabayashi v.

CMS avers that the magnet admissions policy\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nscrutiny to racial classifications enacted by Congress. Though Congress\nitself is charged with enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment's promise of\nequal protection via \"appropriate legislation,\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV,\n§ 5, the Supreme Court in interpreting the Fifth Amendment held Con-\ngress to the same rigorous standards applicable to states and localities.\nSee Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224 (observing \"that any person, of whatever\nrace, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the\nConstitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to\nunequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny\").\n\nCMS and the Swann plaintiffs contend that strict scrutiny does not\napply when a school district is under court order to dismantle the dual\nsystem. Such an approach, however, ignores two of the three pillars of\nSupreme Court's equal protection analysis: skepticism of all racial pref-\nerences and consistent application of heightened scrutiny regardless of\nthe race of the person burdened or benefitted. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at\n223-24. Contrary to the assertions of CMS and the Swann plaintiffs, the\napproach I would adopt does not deprive a school board under court\norder of the necessary tools required to establish a unitary schools sys-\ntem.\n\n        The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the gov-\n        ernment in support of a racial classification, and the evidence\n        offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to\n        distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in govern-\n        mental decisionmaking. . . . Strict scrutiny does not \"trea[t] dis-\n        similar race-based decisions as though they were equally\n        objectionable\"; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all govern-\n        mental race-based decisions in order to decide which are consti-\n        tutionally objectionable and which are not.\n\nId. at 228 (internal citations omitted) (alteration in original). This careful\nevaluation demanded by the Supreme Court will preserve inviolate\nproper desegregation remedies while ensuring that in the process of\ndesegregating a government actor does not stand equal protection on its\nhead by denying some students educational opportunities solely because\nof their race.\n\n                   120\n\fwas adopted to remedy the effects of the dual school system previ-\nously operated in Mecklenburg County.

Like the district court, I would conclude that the CMS mag-\nnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored.\n\nFirst, the magnet admissions policy was not necessary to comply\nwith the court's order to dismantle the dual educational system. CMS\nhad a number of options available to it that would not have deprived\nchildren, solely on account of their race, an available seat in a special-\nized magnet program. There is no evidence in the record that added\nflexibility or a waiver provision would have undermined the use of\nmagnet schools as a desegregation technique. The evidence simply\ndoes not reveal that the magnet admissions policy used was the only\nefficacious option available to CMS.\n\nSecond, this circuit has emphasized that \"[t]he use of racial prefer-\nences must be limited so that they do not outlast their need; they may\nnot take on a life of their own.\" Hayes v. North State Law Enforce-\n\n                   121\n\fment Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658118\"><a href=\"/opinion/658118/ronald-m-hayes-randy-l-hagler-darrell-a-price-david-h-holland-robert-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 216 (4th Cir. 1993) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Like the district court, I can find \"no mention of the\nduration that CMS would use racially segregated lotteries, vacancies,\nand waiting lists.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 290. In light of\nCMS's desire to remain under court order for the indefinite future, see\nsupra Part II.H, the lack of a duration for the magnet admissions pol-\nicy is not surprising. CMS was apparently content to leave available\nmagnet seats empty, despite the waiting lists, for years to come.\n\nThird, I agree with the district court that \"the 60-40 numerical goal\nis related to the relevant population, i.e., the racial composition of\nschoolchildren in CMS.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289. How-\never, there is no evidence that CMS considered the \"practicability of\nachieving this precise ratio in every magnet school,\" id. at 290, or the\nvery real danger that magnet schools would be underutilized because\nseats would be left open despite an abundance of applicants. The\nresult of the admissions policy is but another indication that the CMS\nadministration, in the words of former Superintendent Murphy, \"was\nmore focused on balance than on [educational] outcomes.\" J.A. VI-\n2687.\n\nFourth, the district court aptly described the inflexibility in the\nmagnet admissions policy: \"The Court is hard-pressed to find a more\nrestrictive means of using race than a process that results in holding\nseats vacant while long waiting lists full of eager applicants are virtu-\nally ignored.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289. The policy is\nindeed \"restrictive,\" but it also borders on obduracy. The policy con-\ntained no written waiver provision which, once again, shows a lack\nof concern that these highly specialized schools could and would be\nunderutilized.\n\nFinally, the innocent parties affected are children denied magnet\nslots solely because of their race and parents who \"must wait for\nmonths without knowing where their children eventually will be\nplaced.\" Id. at 290. A child's education is one of the greatest concerns\nof the family, and CMS unnecessarily causes much agonizing when\nit places children of the \"wrong color\" on waiting lists while it\nactively recruits children of the \"right color\" to fill empty magnet\nschool seats.\n\n                   122\n\fIn sum, the magnet admissions policy is not narrowly tailored. The\npolicy is not necessary to dismantle the de jure system, is for an\nunlimited duration, provides for virtually no flexibility, and burdens\ninnocent children and their families. The inequities of CMS's magnet\nadmissions policy call to mind why strict scrutiny is used in the first\nplace: \"Of all the criteria by which men and women can be judged,\nthe most pernicious is that of race.\" Maryland Troopers Ass'n v.\nEvans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607120\"><a href=\"/opinion/607120/maryland-troopers-association-incorporated-the-coalition-of-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1072</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1076 (4th Cir. 1993). Teaching young children\nthat admission to a specialized academic program with available seats\nis contingent on their race is indeed pernicious, and CMS's magnet\nadmissions policy can in no way be described as narrowly tailored to\nachieve the compelling interest of remedying past discrimination.1313\n\nC. Award of Nominal Damages\n\nAfter finding a constitutional violation in the magnet schools, the\ndistrict court held CMS \"nominally liable in the amount of one dol-\nlar.\" Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 290. CMS argues that the nomi-\nnal damages awarded were unjustified because the actions resulting\nin a constitutional violation were taken in good faith. CMS fears that\nthe damages award will \"open the door to numerous suits by other\nstudents who could claim that they did suffer actual damages and\nargue that collateral estoppel prevents CMS from denying liability.\"\nDefendants-Appellants' Brief at 24. Regarding nominal damages, the\nSupreme Court has observed:\n\n        Common-law courts traditionally have vindicated depriva-\n        tions of certain \"absolute\" rights that are not shown to have\n        caused actual injury through the award of a nominal sum of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13 CMS also presented diversity as an alternative compelling state inter-\nest. See Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 289. In this circuit, it is unsettled\nwhether diversity may be a compelling state interest. See Eisenberg v.\nMontgomery County Pub. Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766841\"><a href=\"/opinion/766841/jeffrey-eisenberg-on-behalf-of-jacob-eisenberg-and-elinor-merberg-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130 (4th Cir. 1999), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000). Assuming without deciding whether\ndiversity may be a compelling state interest, I would hold that the magnet\nadmissions policy again fails because it is not narrowly tailored. Whether\nthe interest is remedying past discrimination or diversity, the admissions\npolicy as currently written is in no sense narrow. It is difficult to imagine\nany interest for which the magnet admissions policy is narrowly tailored.\n\n                   123\n\f        money. By making the deprivation of such rights actionable\n        for nominal damages without proof of actual injury, the law\n        recognizes the importance to organized society that those\n        rights be scrupulously observed; but at the same time, it\n        remains true to the principle that substantial damages should\n        be awarded only to compensate actual injury or, in the case\n        of exemplary or punitive damages, to deter or punish mali-\n        cious deprivations of rights.\n\nCarey v.

In the present case there was indeed a con-\nstitutional violation. CMS ran afoul of the Equal Protection Clause\nwhen it adopted a magnet school admissions policy designed to deny\nan available, unclaimed slot in a specialized magnet school to a child\non account of the child's race. In order to recover nominal damages,\nChristina Capacchione need not prove that absent the unconstitutional\npolicy she would have been admitted to the magnet program. The\ninjury in the present case is not the ultimate inability to enroll in the\nmagnet school, but the inability to compete for open, unclaimed seats\non an equal basis. See Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associ-\nated Gen. Contractors v. City of Jacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666\n(1993). Though the two open \"black seats\" at the Olde Providence\nmagnet school were eventually awarded to white children, the fact\nremains that the official magnet admissions policy prohibited children\nlike Christina from competing for the open slots. In fact, CMS left the\ntwo available \"black seats\" at Olde Providence unfilled for most of\nthe summer while Christina and over one hundred other white chil-\ndren languished on a waiting list. The nominal award in this case rec-\nognizes the importance of equal protection under the law and provides\nsome measure of vindication. As for CMS's worry about collateral\nestoppel, liability has already been established, and vacating the nom-\ninal damages would not change this. In sum, I would hold that the dis-\ntrict court did not err in awarding nominal damages.\n\nIV. Injunctive Relief\n\nAfter recounting the unitary status determination and the constitu-\ntional violation in the magnet admissions policy, the district court\n\n                   124\n\fenjoined \"CMS from any further use of race-based lotteries, prefer-\nences, and set-asides in student assignment.\" Capacchione, 57 F.\nSupp. 2d at 292. CMS challenges the district court's injunction as\nunwarranted and overbroad.\n\nBefore a court grants a permanent injunction, the court must first\nfind necessity--a danger of future violations.

Mas-\nsachusetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101678\"><a href=\"/opinion/101678/connecticut-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (1931) (stating that an injunction \"will\nnot be granted against something merely feared as liable to occur at\nsome indefinite time in the future\"); United States v.

Though a flexible tool, an injunc-\ntion may not be used for \"punishment or reparations for . . . past vio-\nlations.\" Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. at 333.\n\nThe district court's finding of a threat of future violations centered\non CMS's offering of diversity as a compelling state interest. This\ninterest was offered after the district court decided that the admissions\npolicy should be reviewed using strict scrutiny. Because in this circuit\nit is unsettled whether diversity may be a compelling state interest,\nsee Eisenberg v. Montgomery County Pub. Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766841\"><a href=\"/opinion/766841/jeffrey-eisenberg-on-behalf-of-jacob-eisenberg-and-elinor-merberg-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130\n(4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), it was improper\nfor the district court to base its injunction on CMS's unsuccessful\ndefense of the policy. At this point, I can discern nothing in the record\nindicating that CMS will ignore the district court order and continue\nto use race in an unconstitutional manner in the operation of the mag-\nnet schools or other schools in the system. CMS represented to the\ndistrict court both during and after trial that it had no intention of con-\ntinuing the magnet plan. In moving for a stay of the injunction, CMS\ndid not ask that the injunction be stayed as to the magnet schools, and\nwas prepared to comply immediately with the court's order. CMS\nrequested a stay as to the non-magnet schools because over 50,000\nstudents were likely to be reassigned in a short period of time. More-\nover, there was no evidence presented at trial about what CMS pro-\nposed to do as a unitary school system. A post-unitary status student\nassignment plan was never given to the district court, and the evi-\n\n                  125\n\fdence simply does not indicate that \"there is an imminent threat of\nillegal action.\" Bloodgood, 783 F.2d at 475. Hence, I agree with the\nultimate conclusion of the majority that the district court erred in\ngranting injunctive relief.\n\nV. Discovery Sanctions\n\nThe district court sanctioned CMS for failing to supplement its\nanswers to interrogatories that sought a list of witnesses. We review\nthe district court's management of discovery under the abuse of dis-\ncretion standard. See Anderson v. Foundation for Advancement, Educ.\n& Employment of Am. Indians, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757769\"><a href=\"/opinion/757769/paull-anderson-v-foundation-for-advancement-education-and-employment-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (4th Cir. 1998).\nThe record reveals that no list of fact witnesses was presented to the\nplaintiff-intervenors until five days before the trial date. At that time,\nCMS presented a list of 174 witness, which was later cut to twenty-\nsix. The plaintiff-intervenors moved for sanctions and the court\ngranted the motion in part. The court had to continue the trial for one\nweek so that the plaintiff-intervenors could depose the newly dis-\nclosed witnesses, and the court held CMS accountable for the fees and\nexpenses of these depositions.\n\nWe have developed a four-part test for a district court to use when\ndetermining what sanctions to impose under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 37. Specifically, \"[t]he court must determine (1) whether\nthe non-complying party acted in bad faith, (2) the amount of preju-\ndice that noncompliance caused the adversary, (3) the need for deter-\nrence of the particular sort of non-compliance, and (4) whether less\ndrastic sanctions would have been effective.\" Id. An examination of\nthe four factors reveals no abuse of discretion by the district court.\n\nFirst, there is ample evidence of bad faith. Early in the case, the\nplaintiff-intervenors presented CMS with an interrogatory asking for\ndisclosure of trial witnesses. In response to the interrogatory, CMS\nstated that it would provide appropriate information concerning wit-\nnesses at the time and in the manner specified by the district court.\nThe plaintiff-intervenors moved to compel discovery, and the court\nagreed with CMS that the request was premature. However, the court\ninstructed CMS to \"supplement its responses [to the interrogatories],\nas it promised, when such information becomes known.\" J.A. I-195.\nAs an excuse for its untimely disclosure of fact witnesses, CMS relies\n\n                  126\n\fon the court's pre-trial order, which provides that \"[a] witness list\ncontaining the name of every proposed witness\" should be filed with\nthe court on the first day of trial. J.A. I-150. This provision of the pre-\ntrial order was clearly for the court's convenience and could not rea-\nsonably be interpreted to apply to disclosures to the other parties.\nBesides, even if such an interpretation were reasonable, the court's\ncommand to supplement interrogatories superceded the pre-trial\norder. Accordingly, bad faith is evident.\n\nSecond, the presentation of such a lengthy witness list on the eve\nof trial to the plaintiff-intervenors was prejudicial. Without the action\nof the court, the plaintiff-intervenors would have had no opportunity\nto depose the witnesses, much less properly prepare for trial. Thus,\nCMS's failure to supplement interrogatories was prejudicial.\n\nThird, such non-compliance with the district court's orders cer-\ntainly needed to be deterred. The district court's condonation of\nCMS's bad faith at a time so close to the beginning of trial could have\nencouraged repetition of improper conduct. As found by the district\ncourt, the record indicates that the failure to supplement interrogato-\nries was not the first time CMS \"was lacking in candor in disclosing\nrelevant and important information.\" J.A. I-305. Hence, deterrence\nwas essential to a proper management of this case.\n\nFinally, less drastic sanctions would not have been effective. Per-\nmitting the plaintiff-intervenors to depose witnesses and requiring\nCMS to pay fees and expenses for the depositions was appropriate.\nCMS was fortunate to receive such a light sanction, and it is doubtful\nwhether lesser measures would have had any effect on CMS's con-\nduct.\n\nIn sum, I agree with the majority that the discovery sanctions\nimposed did not amount to an abuse of the district court's discretion.\n\nVI. Attorney Fees\n\nCMS argues that the district court erred in awarding Capacchione\nattorney fees because (1) Capacchione received only nominal dam-\nages, and (2) young Capacchione would not have been admitted to the\n\n                    127\n\fmagnet program even if race was not a factor insofar as her lottery\nnumber was so high.14 14 Under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988(b) (West. Supp.\n2000), \"[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of\n[§ 1983 and other civil rights laws] . . . the court, in its discretion,\nmay allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reason-\nable attorney's fee as part of the costs.\" To be considered a prevailing\nparty, a party must \"succeed on any significant issue in litigation\nwhich achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing\nsuit.\" Farrar v. Hobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (1992) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In Farrar, the Supreme Court specifically addressed\nthe issue of nominal damages and prevailing party status:\n\n       We therefore hold that a plaintiff who wins nominal dam-\n       ages is a prevailing party under § 1988. . . . A plaintiff may\n       demand payment for nominal damages no less than he may\n       demand payment for millions of dollars in compensatory\n       damages. A judgment for damages in any amount, whether\n       compensatory or nominal, modifies the defendant's behav-\n       ior for the plaintiff's benefit by forcing the defendant to pay\n       an amount of money he otherwise would not pay.\n\nId. at 112-13 (internal citations omitted). The award of nominal dam-\nages constitutes relief on the merits and affects CMS's behavior\ntoward Capacchione if only by forcing CMS to pay. Hence, Capacch-\nione is a prevailing party. See also Shaw v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757571\"><a href=\"/opinion/757571/ruth-o-shaw-melvin-g-shimm-robinson-o-everett-james-m-everett-dorothy/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164\n(4th Cir. 1998) (noting that \"persons within the generic category of\nplaintiff-intervenors have often been found by courts to fit within the\nrubric `prevailing party' for fees purposes\"). That young Capacchione\nhad a high lottery number is irrelevant for a determination of prevail-\ning party status.\n\nI would also affirm the attorney fee award to the plaintiff-\nintervenors to the extent that it compensates them for their litigation\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14 CMS concedes that if unitary status is upheld, Grant is entitled to\nattorney fees. However, CMS takes a much different view of Capacch-\nione's actions insofar as Capacchione originally attacked only the mag-\nnet program and did not have sights set on unitary status. Nonetheless,\nthe record is clear that Capacchione actively participated with Grant in\nthe unitary status litigation.\n\n                  128\n\fof the unitary status issue. Monitoring of a school desegregation\ndecree is crucial to the dismantling of the dual system. See Jenkins v.\nMissouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585865\"><a href=\"/opinion/585865/kalima-jenkins-by-her-next-friend-kamau-agyei-carolyn-dawson-by-her-next/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251 (8th Cir. 1992).

The\nmajority correctly notes that \"success in reaching that last stage [in a\ndesegregation case] is often appropriately credited to the original\nplaintiffs who brought the case.\" Ante at 71. However, the unique\nposture of this case, with the school board and the original plaintiffs\nresisting the resumption of local control, dictates looking at the award\nof fees in a different light.\n\nThe plaintiff-intervenors, through their work in litigating unitary\nstatus, have stepped into the shoes of the original plaintiffs and\nbrought this case to what I believe should be its close. Based on their\nmonitoring of CMS's activities and a belief that the decree had\n\"work[ed] to desegregate the school system,\" Northcross, 611 F.2d at\n637, the plaintiff-intervenors petitioned for a declaration of unitary\nstatus. Though most of the vital information was in the hands of\nCMS's officials, who were often uncooperative in the discovery pro-\ncess, see Capacchione, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.
