Decisions too numerous to mention in this Court and in the Supreme Court show unyielding judicial approval of the legal principle that segregated schooling is inherently unequal. The principle extends beyond public schools. It is \"no longer open to question that a State may not constitutionally require segregation of public facilities.\" Johnson v.

They assert that innate differences in the races in their aptitude for educability are a reasonable basis for classifying children by race, demonstrate that separate schools for Negro children are to the advantage of both races, and justify continued school segregation in Mississippi. We rejected this identical contention on an interlocutory appeal in Stell v. Savannah-Chatham County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1963, 318 F.2d 425, less than two weeks after the court below had sustained the contention. Even before Stell, in St. Helena Parish School Board v. Hall, 5 Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 376, we held that a trial judge abused his discretion in permitting an intervention by persons whose sole purpose was to introduce evidence tending to show that the Supreme Court's decision in Brown was wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Stell was before us a second time, we said, 333 F.2d 55 at 61:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he District Court was bound by the decision of the Supreme Court in Brown. We reiterate that no inferior federal court may refrain from acting as required by that decision even if such a court should conclude that the Supreme Court erred either as to its facts or as to the law. * * Thus was the Savannah case ended then, and there it must end now. We do not read the major premise of the decision of the Supreme Court in the first Brown case as being limited to the facts of the cases there presented. We read it as proscribing segregation in the public education process on the stated ground that separate but equal schools for the races were inherently unequal. This being our interpretation of the teaching of that decision, it follows that it would be entirely inappropriate for it to be rejected or obviated by this court. See Brown v.
