League City does not need a finding that TWIA failed to\n                          comply with the policy to recover under the Insurance\n                          Code. .........................................................................................29\n                 2.

League City is not statutorily prohibited from recovering\n                 against TWIA on its Chapter 541 claims. ...........................................37\n\n          E.

CR7. TWIA answered\n                                             the lawsuit and later demanded an\n                                             appraisal. CR31, 43. Following the\n                                             appraisal, TWIA refused to pay the award,\n                                             and a jury trial followed.\n\nTrial Court:                                 Hon.

Whether League City is entitled to a new trial because the jury question on\n\nthe validity of the appraisal award was improperly submitted.\n\n3.        Whether League City is entitled to a new trial in the interest of justice\n\nbecause the jury found the appraisal award failed to comply with policy terms and\n\nconditions.\n\n4.        Whether League City is entitled to a new trial because the jury charge\n\nshifted the burden of proving the amount of loss to League City, contrary to the\n\nterms of the appraisal provision.\n\n5.        Whether the trial court correctly disregarded the jury’s contract and damages\n\nfindings (in response to questions 1 and 3) as immaterial or supported by legally\n\ninsufficient evidence.\n\n6.

Whether League City is entitled to rendition of judgment in its favor or a\n\nnew trial because the jury questions on notice, repair receipts, and prejudice were\n\nimproperly submitted.\n\n12.       Whether League City is entitled to a new trial because the trial court\n\noverruled League City’s objections to the questions on notice and receipts, refused\n\nto submit League City’s requested question on excuse, and/or refused League\n\nCity’s requested instruction on TWIA’s election to treat the insurance policy as\n\ncontinuing.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 xv\n\f13.

Whether TWIA conclusively established its limitations defense to League\n\nCity’s extra-contractual claims.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               xvi\n\f                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n          Hurricane Ike struck on September 13, 2008. RR14:84. Two days later,\n\nLeague City provided written notice on TWIA’s “First Notice of Loss-Claims\n\nReporting Form.” RR27:211. League City described its loss as “Wind Damage to\n\nVarious Locations” and identified the insured, policy number, policy period, and\n\ndate of loss.\n\n          TWIA raised no complaint about notice. RR14:43-44; 11:61-63; 10:188-90;\n\n16:151. Instead, TWIA accepted and acknowledged League City’s notice, opened\n\na claim with a single claim number, assigned an adjuster and supervisor, and set an\n\ninitial loss reserve. RR10:188-90; 11:61-63; 14:43-44; 27:212; 52:174. TWIA’s\n\nClaim Notice Acknowledgment listed all 140 items covered under the policy and\n\ndescribed the City’s loss as “Hurricane Ike Damage.” RR27:212.\n\n          According to the TWIA supervisor assigned to League City’s claim, the\n\nadjuster who received TWIA’s Acknowledgment should have inspected the listed\n\nitems and prepared an estimate on each one. RR11:61-63, 66. The adjuster could\n\nnot just “overlook” an item. RR11:64-65. Unless the insured said there was no\n\ndamage to a particular facility, TWIA’s policies required the adjuster to inspect\n\nand prepare estimates for each property. RR11:66, 104-05; 16:189. According to\n\nthe TWIA claims manual: “The adjuster is expected to personally inspect and\n\nscope the loss.” RR30:297. Likewise, “Adjusters are expected to make their own\n\n\n47367_1                                1\n\festimates. . . . There should be a separate estimate per each item of insurance\n\ninvolved and the estimates should be clearly marked as to which item they\n\nrepresent.” RR30:299.\n\n          Nothing about the League City claim took it outside the requirements of\n\nTWIA’s claims manual. RR11:59. League City’s claim should have been handled\n\nunder the same guidelines and in the same manner as any other claim. RR11:60.\n\n          But it was not. RR11:65-67, 70-72; 13:91-92; 14:162-63; 16:60, 64-65, 68,\n\n73-74, 176, 178, 181-83; 21:195-99, 204-05. The adjuster did not properly inspect,\n\nscope the loss, and write his own estimates. Id. The adjuster instead had the City\n\ncomplete repairs and submit receipts, after which the adjuster purported to\n\ndetermine whether the repair was covered under the policy. RR11:69-71, 93;\n\n13:88, 91-92, 140-41, 142-42; 16:176.\n\n          TWIA’s adjuster did not need to wait on repair receipts to properly adjust\n\nLeague City’s losses. RR11:61, 66; 13:143-44; 16:69-71; 21:203-05. The adjuster\n\ncould have gone to the damaged sites and within days or weeks completed his own\n\nestimates, before the City had undertaken any repairs. RR13:143-44. The adjuster\n\nshould have inspected the damaged properties, determined what was and was not\n\ndamaged, written estimates, applied appropriate depreciation, and made\n\nrecommendations. RR16:68-69. He was capable of writing estimates; that was his\n\njob. RR16:70-71.\n\n\n47367_1                                 2\n\f          The adjuster’s handling of League City’s claim was inappropriate,\n\nunreasonable, and unacceptable. RR11:67, 81, 84, 88, 91-95; 16:55, 58, 60, 64-65,\n\n69-70, 74; 21:195-200, 203-04. It put the City in the position of having to make\n\nrepairs without knowing what and how much TWIA would cover. RR14:98-99;\n\n16:85-86; 12:119. It also resulted in “[t]oo much delay.” RR11:70. As the claim\n\nsupervisor acknowledged, “[I]f you wait until an expense is incurred, obviously\n\nyou didn’t write the estimate and it’s going to take ever how long it takes. And our\n\njob is to be fair and try to put the money based on the [adjuster’s] appraisal in the\n\ninsured’s hand.” RR11:71.\n\n          TWIA’s failure to properly adjust the claim meant that League City received\n\nno payment on any part of its claim for nine months. RR16:129-30; 29:472, 509-\n\n10. Only in June 2009 did League City receive an “[a]dvance against repairs” for\n\nCity Hall, but it was paid nothing on any other structure—even though TWIA had\n\nnotice of damage, received receipts, and determined coverage months earlier.\n\nRR29:509-10; 12:139-40; 13:18, 125-26; 16:78-81, 114-16, 129-30. In August\n\n2009—eleven months after Ike—TWIA finally issued a check for $304,747.40\n\nrepresenting payments on five identified items: Gazebo, City Hall, Community\n\nCenter, Museum Storage Bldg., and Fire Station 2. RR29:498-99, 514-15. TWIA\n\nacknowledged covered losses to four other items—Library, Council Chambers,\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 3\n\fCouncil Chambers CTS, and Civic Center—but made no payment because it\n\ndetermined the damages did not exceed the deductibles. Id.\n\n          Beyond delay, TWIA’s failure to properly adjust the claim meant that\n\nLeague City was not properly compensated for its windstorm losses. RR16:71, 73;\n\n12:136-37; 13:13-15, 135-36, 137-38, 140-44. TWIA’s adjuster admitted the City\n\nwas not paid for all the damages he personally documented and thought were\n\ncovered by the policy, because he waited on repair receipts instead of adjusting the\n\nloss and preparing his own estimates. RR13:135-36, 140-44, 205-07.\n\n          TWIA was critical of its “‘adjuster’” internally, recognizing he had provided\n\n“[v]ery poor service.”        RR29:486; accord RR11:81-83, 86-88, 91 (internal\n\nconversations “about the poor quality of work”). But TWIA did not share its\n\nconcerns and criticisms with League City. Id.; RR11:91; 12:44. Instead, ten\n\nmonths after Ike, TWIA told the adjuster to close the file within two weeks or the\n\nfile would be taken from him. RR29:490; 13:122; 11:87-88. Had the file been\n\ntaken away, the adjuster would have been paid nothing. RR8:41; 11:87-88.\n\n          The adjuster responded that his “efforts to this point were to protect TWIA\n\nfrom any excessive claim,” and he informed his supervisors he would make an\n\noffer to League City “based on the limited amount of data” he had in his file.\n\nRR29:492. Despite knowing the adjuster had provided poor service, had not\n\nproperly adjusted the claim, and had limited information, TWIA paid League City\n\n\n47367_1                                  4\n\fon the adjuster’s submissions, never informed League City of its concerns with and\n\ncriticisms of the adjuster’s work, and never assigned another adjuster. RR16:137,\n\n150, 160, 193-94.\n\n          League City sued TWIA in January 2012. CR7. TWIA answered the\n\nlawsuit and later demanded an appraisal. CR31; RR52:781-82. But once the\n\nappraisal award was issued, TWIA refused to pay it. CR58, 182; RR52:747.\n\n          At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found that TWIA failed to comply\n\nwith the insurance policy, violated the Insurance Code, and breached its duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing, and awarded damages. CR286-325. The jury also\n\nfound that the appraisal award failed to comply with policy terms and conditions.\n\nId. Although the trial court refused to ask whether TWIA’s policy breach was\n\nexcused, the jury found that League City failed to provide notice and repair\n\nreceipts. Id. But the jury did not find that League City’s failures occurred prior to\n\nTWIA’s breach. Id. Without disclosing its reasoning, the trial court disregarded\n\nthe jury’s findings in favor of League City and rendered judgment that League City\n\ntake nothing. CR678-79.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                5\n\f                             SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n          The trial court’s error in submitting the appraisal question requires a new\n\ntrial on all the City’s claims and causes of action. Even if the appraisal award\n\nfailed to comply with the policy terms and conditions, however, a new trial should\n\nbe granted, so that a new appraisal can be conducted or the parties can agree to\n\nforego the policy’s appraisal requirement.\n\n          TWIA’s alleged defenses do not support rendition of judgment in its favor.\n\nTWIA did not obtain a jury finding on excuse; TWIA did not conclusively\n\nestablish that the City’s alleged breach occurred first; and TWIA elected to treat\n\nthe contract as continuing.\n\n          If a new trial is not granted, League City is entitled to rendition of judgment\n\nin its favor. Disregarding the jury findings that are favorable to League City was\n\nerror; they are neither immaterial nor supported by legally insufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   6\n\f                                      ARGUMENT\n\nI.        The Trial Court Erred in Rendering Judgment for TWIA Based\n          on the Jury’s Finding that the Appraisal Award Failed to Comply\n          With Policy Terms and Conditions.\n          In asking the trial court to render judgment in its favor, TWIA argued the\n\njury’s finding that the appraisal award failed to comply with policy terms and\n\nconditions defeated League City’s ability to recover on any of its claims. CR353.\n\nBecause the trial court erred in submitting the appraisal question, however, a new\n\ntrial is required. Moreover, the failure of the appraisal award should result in a\n\nnew trial, not rendition against League City.\n\n          A.    Because the jury question was submitted improperly, a new\n                trial is required.\n          “An insurance policy is a contract, generally governed by the same rules of\n\nconstruction as all other contracts.” RSUI Indem. Co. v. The Lynd Co., 58 TEX.\n\nSUP. CT. J. 854, No. 13-0080, 2015 WL 2194201, at *2 (Tex. May 8, 2015). Thus,\n\nappraisal clauses should be enforced “[l]ike any other contractual provision.” State\n\nFarm Lloyds v. Johnson, 290 S.W.3d 886, 895 (Tex. 2009).\n\n          The appraisal provision in this case provides:\n\n          Appraisal. If you and we fail to agree on the actual cash value,\n          amount of loss, or cost of repair or replacement, either can make a\n          written demand for appraisal. Each will then select a competent and\n          independent appraiser…. The two appraisers will choose a competent\n          and independent umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within\n          15 days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge….\n          The two appraisers will then determine the amount of loss, stating\n          separately the actual cash value and loss to each item.\n\n47367_1                                   7\n\f          If the appraisers fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the\n          umpire. An itemized decision agreed to by any two of these three and\n          filed with us will determine the amount of the loss.\n\nRR27:157.\n\n          The appraisal provision “directs the appraisers to decide the ‘amount of\n\nloss,’ not to construe the policy or decide whether the insurer should pay.” See\n\nJohnson, 290 S.W.3d at 890. The provision does not require that an appraiser or\n\numpire be qualified “to make complex liability determinations under an insurance\n\npolicy. There is no requirement that they be licensed.” Id. at 890 n. 23 (quoting\n\nBr. of TWIA as Amicus Curiae at 8). There is no requirement that the appraisers\n\nor umpire be insurance experts or forensic engineers “qualified to make policy\n\ninterpretations or to determine cause and origin of the damage being claimed.” Id.\n\nThe appraisers are directed to determine the amount of loss, not to apply all policy\n\nterms and conditions or determine coverage. Id. “There is no explicit requirement\n\nthat the appraisers and umpire inspect the property or read the policy, and many do\n\nnot.” Id.\n\n          If the two appraisers fail to agree, they submit their differences to an\n\n“umpire”—who is often a lawyer or mediator “with no particular experience or\n\nexpertise in property insurance coverage or claims.” Id. Unlike the appraisers, the\n\numpire has no obligation to “determine the amount of loss, stating separately the\n\nactual cash value and loss to each item.” RR27:157. An undefined “itemized\n\n\n47367_1                                    8\n\fdecision” agreed to by any two of the appraisers and/or umpire determines “the\n\namount of the loss,” not every question of coverage, causation, and liability. Id.\n\n          All of this makes sense, because “the scope of appraisal is damages, not\n\nliability.” Johnson, 290 S.W.3d at 890. “[A]ppraisers have no power or authority\n\nto determine questions of causation, coverage, or liability.” Wells v. Am. States\n\nPreferred Ins. Co., 919 S.W.2d 679, 684 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1996, writ denied).\n\n“Indeed, the function of the appraisers is to determine the amount of damage\n\nresulting to the property submitted for their consideration. It is certainly not their\n\nfunction to resolve questions of coverage and interpret provisions of the policy.”\n\nId. at 685. “Nothing in the insurance policy authorizes the appraisal panel to\n\ninterpret provisions of the policy or to consider or resolve questions of causation,\n\ncoverage, or liability.” Germania Farm Mut. Ins. Ass’n v. Williams, No. 11-00-\n\n00393-CV, 2002 WL 32341841, at *4 (Tex. App.—Eastland May 23, 2002, no\n\npet.) (not designated for publication); see Wells, 919 S.W.2d at 684, 685.\n\n          Ignoring “this distinction between damage questions for appraisers and\n\nliability questions for the courts,” Johnson, 290 S.W.3d at 889, the jury was asked,\n\n“Does the appraisal award fail to substantially comply with the policy terms and\n\nconditions?” CR321. And the trial court instructed the jury that “‘[s]ubstantial\n\ncompliance’ means a good faith effort by the appraisers and umpire to follow and\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                9\n\fapply the terms and conditions of the policy to the covered loss caused by\n\nHurricane Ike.” Id.\n\n          League City objected because interpretation of the insurance policy is a\n\nquestion of law for the court, and the appraisers and umpire are not required to\n\napply all policy terms and conditions; rather they are required to comply with the\n\nterms of the appraisal provision. RR22:19-20. League City also asked the trial\n\ncourt to instruct the jury on the appraisal language in the policy. CR332. The trial\n\ncourt overruled League City’s objections and refused its proposed instruction. Id.;\n\nRR22:20.\n\n          When there is no ambiguity, it is the court’s duty to construe the agreement\n\nand instruct the jury “as to the rights of the parties thereunder.” Soell v. Haddon,\n\n85 Tex. 182, 187, 19 S.W. 1087, 1089 (1892). “A trial court should not modify the\n\nterms of an unambiguous policy when instructing the jury, therefore, but should\n\nfollow the terminology contained in that policy.” Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y. v.\n\nSteele, 570 S.W.2d 213, 217 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1978, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.) (citing Int’l Travelers Ass’n v. Marshall, 131 Tex. 258, 262, 114\n\nS.W.2d 851, 852 (1938)). In the event of an ambiguity, “‘[the court] must resolve\n\nthe uncertainty by adopting the construction that most favors the insured[.]’”\n\nRSUI, 2015 WL 2194201, at *3 (citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 10\n\f          The trial court’s instruction—that the appraisal award fails to substantially\n\ncomply with policy terms and conditions if the appraisers and umpire failed to\n\nfollow and apply the terms and conditions of the policy to the covered loss caused\n\nby Hurricane Ike—affirmatively misstates the unambiguous terms of the policy\n\nand is legally incorrect. RR27:157. The appraisal award did not have to comply\n\nwith all “policy terms and conditions” and the umpire and appraisers had no\n\nobligation “to follow and apply the terms and conditions of the policy to the\n\ncovered loss caused by Hurricane Ike.” See RR27:157; Johnson, 290 S.W.3d at\n\n889-90; Wells, 919 S.W.2d at 684-85. The appropriate question was “whether\n\nthere was substantial compliance with the appraisal mandates.” Providence Lloyds\n\nIns. Co. v. Crystal City Indep. Sch. Dist., 877 S.W.2d 872, 875-76 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 1994, no writ). The appraisers and umpire must follow and apply\n\n“the appraisal section of the policy,” not every policy term and condition. Wells,\n\n919 S.W.2d at 683.\n\n          An incorrect jury instruction is grounds for reversal if it probably caused the\n\nrendition of an improper judgment. Willis v. Donnelly, 199 S.W.3d 262, 275-76\n\n(Tex. 2006). To determine whether the instruction probably caused an improper\n\njudgment, the court examines the entire record.             Quantum Chem. Corp. v.\n\nToennies, 47 S.W.3d 473, 480 (Tex. 2001). “An improper instruction is especially\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                  11\n\flikely to cause an unfair trial when the trial is contested and the evidence sharply\n\nconflicting, as it was in the present case.” Id.\n\n          This trial turned on the validity, effect, and appropriateness of the appraisal\n\naward. In opening argument, TWIA’s counsel asked: “Why is Texas Windstorm\n\nhere?” RR7:85. He answered: “Two principal reasons. [First,] [t]he appraisal\n\naward is absolutely not, absolutely not in substantial compliance with policy terms\n\nand conditions.” Id.\n\n          After insisting that “[p]rior payments and applicable deductibles are easy to\n\nfigure out by looking at the policy,” TWIA’s counsel criticized the umpire and\n\nLeague City’s appraiser for not reading the policy: “Neither of the two gentlemen\n\nwhose numbers make up the appraisal ever had possession of the TWIA insurance\n\npolicy. Never read the TWIA insurance policy.” RR7:86. He argued that “the\n\nappraisal based on policy language should have involved only the buildings that\n\nwere called to TWIA’s attention during the adjustment period.” RR7:95. He\n\ncontinued: “Policy terms and conditions. To this very day . . . the receipts for the\n\nrepairs that League City did . . . those receipts have never to this day been\n\nproduced or given to TWIA or the appraisers . . . .” RR7:95-96.\n\n          Having highlighted the evidence in opening argument, TWIA introduced the\n\numpire’s testimony that he had never seen the insurance policy and had not read it;\n\nthat he did not know what the policy covered; that he did not “get involved into\n\n\n47367_1                                  12\n\fwhether these numbers are applicable under the policy;” that he did not determine\n\nwhether exclusions applied, for example whether “different items involved\n\nincreased cost of construction;” and that he did not get receipts. RR21:124-28.\n\n          TWIA also elicited testimony from its corporate representative that the\n\nappraisal award did not “rule out other sources for the leaks.” RR9:39. “It doesn’t\n\ngo into any causes at all.” RR9:40. TWIA’s corporate representative criticized the\n\nappraisers for not obtaining receipts and maintenance records, RR9:38, and for not\n\nattaching “documentation as to the cost or reason for replacing the roofs on the\n\nlibrary, civic center or City Hall.” RR9:43-44; accord RR8:217. He criticized the\n\naward because “it’s impossible for us to tell if some of those items are not covered\n\nunder the policy, if some of the damage noted here was from another peril besides\n\nwind and hail, or in this case the actual cash value, did it include sales tax? Did it\n\ninclude over[head and] profit? We can’t tell any of those things that are all policy\n\nterms and conditions from a lump sum number like that.” RR10:44-45.\n\n          In closing argument, TWIA emphasized the erroneous jury instruction and\n\nberated the umpire for not reading the policy and not applying its terms and\n\nconditions: “Now, how in the world can a man say that he is applying the terms\n\nand conditions of the policy or that his appraisal meets those terms and conditions\n\nwhen he doesn’t have the document? . . . He didn’t even have it. It’s not that he\n\nsaid, ‘Well, I looked at it a little bit, scanned it, flipped through it.’ Nothing. Did\n\n\n47367_1                               13\n\fnot have the document on which he has to base his award.”                RR22:142-43.\n\nTWIA’s lawyer continued: “I don’t want to belabor Mr. Burgess’ testimony, but\n\n22, ‘Does the appraisal award fail to substantially comply with the policy terms\n\nand conditions?’ You’ve got a definition for substantial compliance means a good\n\nfaith effort by the appraiser’s umpire to follow and define the terms and conditions\n\nof the policy to the covered loss. And we covered this when we were talking about\n\nNo. 2. But just so we don’t forget it, Mr. Burgess in his testimony never had the\n\npolicy. Doesn’t apply the policy terms and conditions. Didn’t even look at the\n\npolicy when he came up with his appraisal numbers. So, how in the world can the\n\naward meet the policy terms and conditions if you don’t have the policy, if you\n\ndon’t know what it says? It doesn’t.” RR22:156.\n\n          The validity of the appraisal award was a hotly contested, critical issue. “To\n\nask the jury to resolve this dispute without a proper legal definition to the essential\n\nlegal issue was reversible error.” Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. John Carlo Tex., Inc., 843\n\nS.W.2d 470, 472 (Tex. 1992). The trial court’s erroneous instruction wrongly\n\nallowed TWIA’s witnesses to opine and TWIA’s counsel to argue that the\n\nappraisal award was invalid and untrustworthy because the appraisers did not read\n\nor apply the policy’s myriad terms, conditions, and exclusions. The jury reached\n\nan improper verdict premised on an improper submission which led to the\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                  14\n\frendition of an improper judgment. The trial court’s error was not harmless, and it\n\nentitles League City to a new trial. Id.; Willis, 199 S.W.3d at 275-76.\n\n          Alternatively, in submitting question 22 broadly and asking whether the\n\nappraisal award failed to substantially comply with unspecified policy terms and\n\nconditions, the Court commingled potentially valid and invalid legal theories and\n\nhas made it impossible for this Court to determine whether the jury based its\n\nverdict on a properly submitted theory for avoiding the appraisal award or an\n\ninvalid theory that should not have been submitted. See Crown Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nCasteel, 22 S.W.3d 378, 388-89 (Tex. 2000). The appraisers and umpire had no\n\nobligation to read and “construe the policy or decide whether the insurer should\n\npay.” Johnson, 290 S.W.3d at 890. Yet, the charge allowed TWIA to argue\n\nexactly that, and the jury apparently accepted TWIA’s argument in answering yes\n\nto question 22. In this situation, the error is presumed harmful and League City is\n\nentitled to a new trial. Texas Comm’n on Human Rights v. Morrison, 381 S.W.3d\n\n533, 536-38 (Tex. 2012) (“TCHR timely objected to the question at issue, which\n\nallowed the jury to find liability based on an invalid legal theory. Therefore, we\n\npresume harm . . . and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial.”).\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                15\n\f          B.    If the appraisal award failed to comply with the policy\n                terms, a new trial should be granted.\n          Even if given effect, the jury’s rejection of the appraisal award should result\n\nin a new trial. Upon remand, a new appraisal can be conducted or the parties can\n\nagree to forego the insurance policy’s appraisal requirement.\n\n          The appraisal provision binds the parties to have the amount of loss\n\ndetermined in a particular way. See RR27:157; In re Allstate County Mut. Ins. Co.,\n\n85 S.W.3d 193, 195 (Tex. 2002). The appraisal clause does not provide for a\n\nforfeiture of that right, and the policy states that a provision can be waived only by\n\nan endorsement made part of the policy. See RR27:157-58; In re S. Ins. Co., No.\n\n09-11-00022-CV, 2011 WL 846205, at *2 (Tex. App.—Beaumont Mar. 10, 2011,\n\norig. proceeding) (mem. op.). In the absence of a valid waiver, the appraisal clause\n\nis enforceable. E.g., In re Slavonic Mut. Fire Ins. Ass’n, 308 S.W.3d 556, 559\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, orig. proceeding) (“Where an insurance\n\ncontract mandates appraisal to resolve the parties’ dispute regarding the value of a\n\nloss, and the appraisal provision has not been waived, a trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion and misapplies the law by refusing to enforce the appraisal provision.”).\n\n          The jury was not asked to and did not find that League City or TWIA\n\nwaived or was estopped from insisting on compliance with the appraisal provision.\n\nSee TEX. R. CIV. P. 279 (“[A]ll independent grounds of recovery or of defense not\n\nconclusively established under the evidence and no element of which is submitted\n\n47367_1                                  16\n\for requested are waived.”). Furthermore, TWIA never asked the court to declare\n\nthe appraisal provision void or unenforceable, and the trial court could not make\n\nsuch a determination on its own motion. See CR58-59; In re Park Mem’l Condo.\n\nAss’n, Inc., 322 S.W.3d 447, 450-51 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, orig.\n\nproceeding) (“A trial court cannot grant relief to a party in the absence of\n\npleadings[.]”).\n\n          Assuming the jury now has “invalidated the Appraisal Award,” CR363,\n\nLeague City had no obligation to have anticipated that the jury would fix the\n\namount of loss in contravention of the policy’s appraisal provision—especially\n\nwhen neither TWIA nor League City had pleaded the appraisal provision was\n\nunenforceable. See Mitchell v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 579 F.2d 342, 352 (5th Cir.\n\n1978) (concluding that insured “could not have anticipated that the jury would fix\n\nthe amount of loss” and agreeing with insurers that defective appraisal should be\n\nremanded to original appraisers for correction). Numerous courts have held that\n\nthe failure of an attempted appraisal does not abrogate the policy’s appraisal\n\nprovision and allow a jury to determine the amount of loss. See, e.g., id.; St.\n\nCharles Parish Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 1 v. United Fire & Cas. Co., 681 F. Supp. 2d\n\n748, 765 (E.D. La. 2010) (holding “remand to the appraisers is the most reasonable\n\napproach”); Woodward v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., No. 3:09-CV-0228-G, 2010 WL\n\n1186323, at *3-4 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 26, 2010) (granting insurer’s motion to compel\n\n\n47367_1                             17\n\fappraisal after determining that appraisal process had not been completed in\n\ncompliance with policy); Grady v. Home Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 63 A. 173, 174-\n\n76 (R.I. 1906) (failure of appraisal did not allow insured to sue on policy without\n\ncomplying with demand for new appraisal).\n\n          No court has held that an insured must prove the amount of its losses in\n\ncontravention of the appraisal clause merely because the appraisal award has been\n\nchallenged. To the contrary, the Dallas Court of Appeals disregarded an appraisal\n\naward and thereafter remanded the insured’s claims for a new trial on the merits as\n\nto both liability and damages. Wells, 919 S.W.2d at 686-87. The court concluded:\n\n“The Wellses are not required to again participate involuntarily in yet another\n\nappraisal . . . when they have suffered a defective appraisal process through no\n\nfault of their own.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n          Equally in the case, if the appraisal award is disregarded, the result should be\n\na new trial, not rendition of judgment against League City. Id. TWIA should not\n\nbe able to avoid paying League City for covered losses because of a failure by the\n\numpire or the appraisers to deliver the appraisal award contemplated by the policy.\n\nAnd having spent more than $150,000 in appraiser and umpire fees, CR552,\n\nLeague City should not be deprived of its policy benefits because the appraisers\n\nand/or umpire misunderstood their obligations.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   18\n\f          If the appraisal award failed to substantially comply with policy terms and\n\nconditions, the Court should order a new trial on all issues, so that a new appraisal\n\ncan be conducted or the parties can agree to forego the insurance policy’s appraisal\n\nrequirement. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 320 (“[A] separate trial on unliquidated damages\n\nalone shall not be ordered if liability issues are contested.”).\n\nII.       If a New Trial Is Not Granted, League City Is Entitled to\n          Rendition of Judgment on Its Breach of Contract Claim.\n          A new trial should be granted on all issues. If a new trial is not granted\n\nhowever, League City is entitled to rendition of judgment based on the jury’s\n\nfavorable findings on its breach of contract claim.\n\n          A.    The jury’s finding that TWIA failed to comply with the\n                insurance policy is supported by at least some evidence.\n          In response to question 1, the jury found that TWIA failed to comply with\n\nthe insurance policy. CR289. TWIA never challenged the jury’s breach finding as\n\nsupported by no evidence. See CR350-82. The finding is amply supported.\n\n          TWIA’s corporate representative testified that TWIA would breach the\n\ninsurance policy if it did not properly investigate a claim, if it failed to pay what is\n\nowed under the policy, or if it failed to timely pay what is owed. RR10:213. A\n\nreasonable investigation requires that an adjuster obtain enough information to\n\nwrite an accurate estimate. RR8:28. “The adjuster is expected to personally\n\ninspect and scope the loss.” RR30:297. “A scope is what the adjuster compiles\n\n\n47367_1                                 19\n\fduring his inspection. It’s all the information that he gets; dimensions, the type of\n\nbuilding materials, where the damage is, where the damage isn’t…. Without a\n\nscope, you can’t write an estimate.” RR16:64-65.\n\n          TWIA’s adjuster did not properly inspect, scope the loss, and write\n\nestimates. RR11:59-72; 13:91-92; 14:162-63; 16:60, 64-65, 68, 73-74, 176, 178,\n\n181-83; 21:195-99. TWIA could not just wait on repair receipts as an excuse or\n\nsubstitute for properly investigating and adjusting League City’s claim. RR11:70-\n\n72, 93; 16:68-71, 138-40, 144; 21:198-99. The failure of the adjustment process\n\nmeant the City did not get paid what it was owed under the policy and did not get\n\npaid in a timely manner. RR13:14-15, 18-19, 27, 29-30; 16:70-71, 73-74, 129-30,\n\n136, 140, 149; 21:202, 204, 196-97; 10:186-87.\n\n          B.    There is at least some evidence of League City’s damages.\n          Question 3 asked, “What amount of the appraisal damage award is for\n\ndamage caused by windstorm?” CR293. As TWIA recognized, question 3 is a\n\n“damage” question that allowed the jury to find the amount of League City’s\n\nwindstorm damages without regard to the appraisal award. RR22:36-37.\n\n          League City objected to question 3 on the ground that it had no burden to\n\nprove the dollar amount of the damage caused by Hurricane Ike.             RR22:11.\n\nLeague City’s only burden was to prove that TWIA failed to pay for covered losses\n\nunder the policy. Id. Under the terms of the policy, the appraisal award sets the\n\n\n47367_1                                20\n\famount of loss. Id. Because the jury charge improperly shifted the burden of\n\nproving the amount of loss to League City contrary to the terms of the appraisal\n\nprovision, League City should be granted a new trial so that the appraisal provision\n\ncan be enforced or the parties can agree to waive the appraisal provision. See\n\nsection I.B. above; see also Willis, 199 S.W.3d at 275-76 (erroneous charge on\n\nmeasure of damages required remand).\n\n          In any event, TWIA’s adjuster admitted that League City was never paid for\n\na “good amount” of the damages that he personally documented and determined\n\n“were caused by Ike and covered by the policy[.]” RR13:140-44.\n\n          Tony Meyer, League City’s facilities maintenance supervisor, inspected\n\nmany of League City’s facilities immediately after the storm, and he explained the\n\nhurricane damage he saw on a structure-by-structure basis. See, e.g., RR14:102-07\n\n(library), 107-09 (park gazebo), 120-24 (city hall), 128-32 (civic center), 132-35\n\n(community center), 141-43 (fire station 1), 146-47 (vehicle maintenance), 157-59,\n\n161 (fire station 2), 15:52-54 (library), 54-55 (council chambers), 55-57\n\n(community center), 60 (vehicle maintenance), 65 (fire station 1), 71-72 (fire\n\nstation 2), 75-76 (museum storage). The jury also heard from the City’s forensic\n\nengineering expert, who inspected the structures, spoke with witnesses, and offered\n\nhis opinions on the specific damage caused by windstorm. See RR17:6-8, 18-20,\n\n36, 37-77 (library); 78-88 (council chambers); 88-94 (city hall); 94-112 (civic\n\n\n47367_1                                21\n\fcenter); 112-20 (community center); 18:13-15 (library), 15-16, 18 (council\n\nchambers), 18-23 (city hall), 24-34 (civic center), 43-45 (vehicle maintenance), 45-\n\n50 (fire station 1), 50-57 (fire station 2).\n\n          As for the dollar value of the damage, TWIA’s corporate representative\n\nexplained that he had analyzed the appraisers’ estimates, all available photographs,\n\nthe engineering reports and the policy, and created his own “adjusted award” for\n\neach policy item. RR8:109, 114-16; 10:138-39; 27:256-63. His analysis had\n\n“nothing to do with” the appraisal award. RR10:139-40. Instead, his adjusted\n\naward was based on the damage he could document four or five years after the\n\nloss. RR7:166; 8:112-13, 115-16. And his adjusted award applied the insurance\n\npolicy terms and conditions, including exclusions. Id. His spreadsheet supplied\n\nthe jury with his estimate of the City’s Hurricane Ike damage, the estimates of each\n\nappraiser, and the amounts previously paid by TWIA. See RR27:262-63.\n\n          The corporate representative’s testimony and spreadsheet provide some\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s answers to question 3 and preclude rendition of\n\njudgment against League City. But the jury also had the detailed estimates of both\n\nappraisers, multiple repair bids for City Hall, the City’s records documenting\n\nHurricane Ike expenses, and the adjuster’s spreadsheets identifying Hurricane Ike\n\ndamage. See RR21:20; 29:355-430; 31:373-79; 32:52-70; 33:114-24; 34:178-91,\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                  22\n\f237-46, 390-95; 35:105-17, 366-74; 36:52-58, 266-71, 363-81; 37:163-66, 173-98;\n\n38:67-70, 143-54; 44:373-86, 523-29, 561-77; 46:343-496, 695-734; 52:1402-07.\n\n          TWIA’s corporate representative testified that the jury could reach its own\n\nconclusions about the amount of the City’s covered losses, just as he had, by\n\nexamining the two appraisers’ estimates, the policy, the photographs, “and\n\neverything else.” RR8:116. That is what the jury did.\n\n          The jury’s damage awards are supported by the evidence, and the trial court\n\nerred in disregarding them. Even if there were not legally sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the entire amount of damages, the result should be a new trial, not\n\nrendition. See Guevara v. Ferrer, 247 S.W.3d 662, 670 (Tex. 2007) (“[W]hen\n\nthere is evidence to support some damages it is not appropriate to render\n\njudgment.”).\n\n          C.    TWIA’s complaint about disclosure responses does not\n                support rendition.\n          TWIA’s complaints that League City did not adequately disclose its damage\n\nmodel do not support rendition, and the trial court correctly overruled TWIA’s\n\ncomplaints. See RR6:5-7; 22:36-37.\n\n          League City disclosed the following regarding its claims and damages:\n\n          [T]he City has not been properly compensated under the terms of its\n          insurance policy. . . . TWIA wrongfully denied Plaintiff’s claim for\n          repairs of the Properties, even though the Policy provided coverage\n          for losses such as those suffered by Plaintiff. Furthermore, TWIA\n          underpaid some of Plaintiff’s claims by not providing full coverage\n\n47367_1                                 23\n\f          . . . . As such, Plaintiff has not been paid in full for the damages to its\n          Properties . . . .\n\n          An Appraisal Award totaling $3,449,755.37 was entered in this case\n          on October 24, 2013. Plaintiff will rely on this appraisal award to\n          determine the amount of the loss, as both TWIA and League City\n          agreed . . . .\n\n          Plaintiff will seek damages for breach of contract, violations of [the\n          Insurance Code], breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and\n          fraud . . . [A]ll amounts will be ultimately determined by the jury. . . .\n          For breach of contract, Plaintiff is entitled to regain the benefit of its\n          bargain, which is the amount of its claim, together with attorneys’\n          fees.\n\nCR211-14.\n\n          The City appropriately disclosed that it would “rely on” the appraisal award\n\n“to determine the amount of the loss.” CR214. Nonetheless, that disclosure does\n\nnot identify “the Appraisal Award as its [exclusive] method for calculating its\n\ndamages.” Cf. CR366. To the contrary, the City disclosed that it had “not been\n\nproperly compensated under the terms of its insurance policy,” had “not been paid\n\nin full for the damages to its Properties,” and was “entitled to regain the benefit of\n\nits bargain.” CR211-14.\n\n          Moreover, Strickland’s testimony explaining his analysis of the appraisers’\n\nestimates and Strickland’s spreadsheet (identifying the amount of each appraiser’s\n\nestimate and Strickland’s “adjusted award” for each structure) were admitted\n\nwithout objection. RR7:41-42, 46; 8:109-16; 10:139-40; 27:262-63. The City’s\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   24\n\fclaim documents and Gauthier’s spreadsheets were also admitted without\n\nobjection. RR7:41-42; 12:91-92.\n\n          The unobjected-to evidence supports the submission of and answers to\n\nquestion 3. See Stewart & Stevenson LLC v. Foret, No. 01-11-01032-CV, 2013\n\nWL 4337319, at *5 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Aug. 15, 2013, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.) (obligating trial court to submit an issue if there is more than a scintilla of\n\nevidence on issue); Guevara, 247 S.W.3d at 670 (rendition inappropriate “when\n\nthere is evidence to support some damages”).\n\n          In any event, the erroneous admission of evidence in violation of disclosure\n\nrequirements would lead to a new trial, not rendition of judgment in TWIA’s favor.\n\nSee Alvarado v. Farah Mfg. Co., 830 S.W.2d 911, 912, 917 (Tex. 1992).\n\n          Likewise, the submission of an erroneous damages question would result in\n\na new trial, not rendition of a take-nothing judgment against League City. See\n\nSpencer v. Eagle Star Ins. Co. of Am., 876 S.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex. 1994) (defective\n\njury question is not immaterial and authorizes trial court “only to grant a new trial,\n\nnot to render judgment notwithstanding the verdict”); Arthur Andersen & Co. v.\n\nPerry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 817 (Tex. 1997) (remanding for new trial\n\nwhen defective damages question submitted); Guevara, 247 S.W.3d at 670.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 25\n\fIII.      If a New Trial Is Not Granted, League City Is Entitled to\n          Rendition of Judgment on Its Insurance Code Claim.\n          If the Court does not grant a new trial, it should render judgment in favor of\n\nLeague City on its Insurance Code claims. Those claims are independent of the\n\nCity’s contract claim, and the jury’s findings are material and supported by legally\n\nsufficient evidence. See Spencer, 876 S.W.2d at 157 (holding trial court can\n\ndisregard jury finding only if it is immaterial or supported by no evidence).\n\n          A.    The finding that TWIA violated the Insurance Code is\n                supported by some evidence and is material.\n          Chapter 541 of the Texas Insurance Code was enacted to protect insurance\n\nconsumers by prohibiting unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the business of\n\ninsurance. Rocor Int’l, Inc. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 77 S.W.3d 253, 260 (Tex.\n\n2002). The chapter is to be “liberally construed and applied” to promote its\n\npurposes. TEX. INS. CODE § 541.008.\n\n          Chapter 541 states that it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for an\n\ninsurer to fail to affirm or deny coverage of a claim within a reasonable time. Id. §\n\n541.060(a)(4). And the chapter expressly authorizes a private right of action\n\nagainst an insurer by an insured who sustains actual damages caused by the\n\ndeceptive act or practice. Id. § 541.151. The insured is entitled to recover “actual\n\ndamages, plus court costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees.” Id. §\n\n541.152.\n\n\n47367_1                                  26\n\f          The jury’s finding that TWIA failed to affirm or deny coverage within a\n\nreasonable time, is supported by the evidence. TWIA never argued otherwise. See\n\nCR367-68.\n\n          TWIA did not properly determine and communicate the amount of League\n\nCity’s covered losses. RR16:65, 72, 73-74, 115, 146-47, 176, 178, 181-93, 185-\n\n89, 193-94.      TWIA was to determine coverage within 30 days of the claim.\n\nRR16:69, 110. This is a “very important” part of the adjuster’s job, RR16:112, and\n\nthe City needed to know whether the claim would be accepted or denied.\n\nRR16:84. But TWIA’s adjuster was still trying to figure out coverage in April\n\n2009. RR16:78, 81, 112. Nine months after the hurricane, the adjuster still had\n\nnot written any estimates. RR16:129-30. That was too late and unreasonable.\n\nRR11:67, 84, 88; 16:110, 115; 21:196-97.\n\n          TWIA’s own representatives acknowledged that the adjuster did not\n\nproperly and timely determine League City’s covered losses.        Id.   A claims\n\nsupervisor with TWIA testified that the adjuster should have had enough\n\ninformation to determine covered losses before August 4, 2009. RR21:146, 202.\n\nThe adjuster, not League City, was supposed to inspect, identify damages,\n\ndetermine coverage, and write estimates.         RR21:204-06.    Another TWIA\n\nsupervisor agreed. RR11:63-67, 69-72, 93.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               27\n\f          It was not appropriate to wait for the insured to make repairs and then\n\ndetermine whether a repair receipt was covered under the policy. RR11:70-72, 88,\n\n93; 16:69-70. That process resulted in “[t]oo much delay.” RR 11:70. The\n\nadjuster should have been able to determine coverage at the time of his inspection,\n\nRR16:110, and did not need to wait for receipts. RR13:143-44; 16:87-88, 108-10.\n\nThe adjuster’s duty was to adjust the claim and prepare estimates of the City’s\n\ncovered losses without waiting for receipts.       RR13:143-44; 16:87-88, 108-10.\n\nThus, reimbursing the City for receipts did not excuse TWIA’s failure to properly\n\ndetermine coverage for the City’s losses in the first instance. RR16:138. The\n\nadjuster did not need receipts from the City to adjust and estimate the claim.\n\nRR11:68, 70, 74; 16:74, 115, 147.\n\n          All of this evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s finding that TWIA\n\nfailed to affirm or deny coverage in a reasonable time.\n\n          B.    League City’s Insurance Code claims are independent of its\n                breach of contract theory.\n          Instead of challenging the evidence supporting the jury’s findings that it\n\nviolated the Insurance Code, TWIA argued that rejection of League City’s contract\n\nclaim defeats recovery under chapter 541. CR367. That is incorrect, and it is also\n\ninconsistent with TWIA’s claim that the jury’s breach-of-contract finding was\n\nimmaterial. Because a policy claim is independent of a bad-faith claim, League\n\nCity did not need to prove that TWIA breached the insurance policy to recover\n\n47367_1                                28\n\funder the Insurance Code. But League City did obtain a finding that TWIA\n\nbreached the policy. CR289.\n\n               1.    League City does not need a finding that TWIA failed\n                     to comply with the policy to recover under the\n                     Insurance Code.\n          TWIA argued below that “rejection of League City’s breach of contract\n\nclaim defeats recovery under Chapter 541.” CR367. In support, TWIA cited State\n\nFarm Lloyds v. Page, 315 S.W.3d 525, 532 (Tex. 2010). Page does not support\n\nTWIA’s argument. Page provides that if “the issue of coverage is resolved in the\n\ninsurer’s favor, extra-contractual claims do not survive.” Id. Page continues:\n\n“There can be no liability under . . . the Insurance Code if there is no coverage\n\nunder the policy. Similarly, to the extent the policy affords coverage, extra-\n\ncontractual claims remain viable.” Id.; see also Progressive County Mut. Ins. Co.\n\nv. Boyd, 177 S.W.3d 919, 922 (Tex. 2005) (“There can be no liability under article\n\n21.55 if the insurance claim is not covered by the policy.”); Republic Ins. Co. v.\n\nStoker, 903 S.W.2d 338, 340-41 (Tex. 1995) (“As a general rule there can be no\n\nclaim for bad faith when an insurer has promptly denied a claim that is in fact not\n\ncovered.”).\n\n          TWIA’s argument is a classic “misidentifying the cause” logical fallacy.\n\nTWIA misreads the cases above as holding that the inability to recover on a\n\ncontract theory—for any reason—necessarily defeats recovery on extra-contractual\n\n\n47367_1                               29\n\fclaims. But it is the absence of coverage alone that can defeat extra-contractual\n\nclaims. Id.\n\n          Here it is undisputed that League City sustained at least some covered\n\nwindstorm losses, as TWIA determined. RR29:498. The dispute was over the\n\namount of League City’s covered losses, not whether coverage existed at all.\n\nTWIA has never argued—much less has it established—that it did not breach the\n\npolicy because no part of League City’s claim was covered by the policy. Id.\n\n          TWIA’s argument, taken at face value, is that a bad-faith claim is wholly\n\ndependent on the policy claim—that is, an insured cannot recover under the\n\nInsurance Code unless he also recovers under the contract. That argument flies in\n\nthe face of significant authority to the contrary.\n\n          The supreme court has repeatedly held that “a policy claim is independent of\n\na bad faith claim.” Stoker, 903 S.W.2d at 340-41. “[R]ecovery for bad faith does\n\nnot depend on a breach of the insurance contract.”           Id. at 344 (Spector, J.,\n\nconcurring). “A breach of an insurance contract claim is separate and distinct from\n\nbad faith, Insurance Code or DTPA causes of action.” U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v.\n\nMillard, 847 S.W.2d 668, 672 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, orig.\n\nproceeding). “Both the DTPA and the Insurance Code provide that the statutory\n\nremedies are cumulative of other remedies.” Vail v. Tex. Farm Bureau Mut.

Sec. Nat’l Ins.\n\nCo., 788 S.W.2d 566, 567 (Tex. 1990).1\n\n          The issue of coverage has not been conclusively established in TWIA’s\n\nfavor on the entirety of League City’s claim, so there is no basis for disregarding\n\nthe jury’s liability finding on violation of the Insurance Code.\n\n                2.    Moreover, the jury found that League City failed to\n                      comply with the contract.\n          Moreover, if a breach of contract finding were a prerequisite for recovery\n\nunder the Insurance Code, League City obtained it. CR289. TWIA has never\n\nchallenged the jury’s breach finding as supported by no evidence. CR350-82. And\n\nthat finding is supported by legally sufficient evidence.              See Section II.A.\n\nAccordingly, if an insured’s recovery for Insurance Code violations depends upon\n\na breach finding, League City has the requisite jury finding and evidence to\n\nsupport it. See United Nat’l Ins. Co. v. AMJ Invs., LLC, 447 S.W.3d 1, 11-12 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. dism’d) (allowing insured to recover under\n\n\n\n\n1\n Because League City’s Insurance Code claims are separate from, and do not depend on, its\npolicy claim, and for the same reasons discussed in section V, TWIA’s arguments based on the\npolicy defenses do not and cannot prevent League City from recovering under the Insurance\nCode.\n\n47367_1                                  31\n\fthe Insurance Code where insured “pleaded and proved that its claim was covered\n\nand its insurer breached the contract”).2\n\n          Contrary to TWIA’s argument, a jury finding cannot be both “immaterial”\n\nand “necessary.” See CR361, 367. Those words are antonyms; immaterial means\n\n“not material, essential, or necessary.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 749 (6th ed.\n\n1990). If the jury’s finding that TWIA breached its contract is necessary for\n\nrecovery under the Insurance Code, then it is not immaterial and cannot be\n\ndisregarded. See Oilwell Div., U.S. Steel Corp. v. Fryer, 493 S.W.2d 487, 491\n\n(Tex. 1973) (holding that a necessary element of fraud could not be an\n\n“immaterial” finding); Outlet Co. v. Int’l Sec.

The finding of damages caused by TWIA’s deceptive act is\n                 supported by some evidence and is material.\n                 1.      League City         can recover         benefit-of-the-bargain\n                         damages.\n          TWIA argued below that “[t]here can be no recovery under Chapter 541\n\nunless the insured suffers an injury ‘independent of the policy claim.’” CR368.\n\nThat is incorrect. When, as here, a property insurer fails to pay the full amount of\n\n\n2\n    The City also has a sufficient damages finding on its breach claim.

AMJ Invs., 447 S.W.3d at 11.\n\n          The Insurance Code provides that a prevailing plaintiff is entitled to recover\n\n“the amount of actual damages” caused by the insurer’s deceptive act or practice.\n\nTEX. INS. CODE § 541.152(a)(1). The Insurance Code does not define “actual\n\ndamages,” but the supreme court has. State Farm Life Ins. Co. v. Beaston, 907\n\nS.W.2d 430, 435 (Tex. 1995). “Actual damages are those damages recoverable\n\nunder common law.”          Arthur Andersen, 945 S.W.2d at 816.         And under the\n\ncommon law, benefit-of-the-bargain damages are one measure of direct actual\n\ndamages. Id. at 817; see Roustan v. Sanderson, No. 02-09-00377-CV, 2011 WL\n\n4502265, at *8 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Sept. 29, 2011, pet. denied) (mem. op.).\n\nGiven this well-settled understanding of the meaning of “actual damages,” the\n\nTexas Pattern Jury Charges expressly recognize the appropriateness of a benefit-\n\nof-the-bargain measure of damages for Insurance Code violations. See COMM. ON\n\nPATTERN JURY CHARGES, STATE BAR OF TEX., TEXAS PATTERN JURY CHARGES—\n\nBUS., CONSUMER, INS. & EMPLOYMENT PJC 115.10, 115.13 (2012).\n\n          The supreme court has long held that “an insurer’s unfair refusal to pay the\n\ninsured’s claim causes damages as a matter of law in at least the amount of the\n\npolicy benefits wrongfully withheld.” Vail, 754 S.W.2d at 136; see Waite Hill\n\n\n47367_1                                  33\n\fServs., Inc. v.

Because League City proved its\n\nclaim was covered and TWIA breached the policy, “the absence of an independent\n\ninjury does not foreclose liability for [TWIA’s] violation of the Insurance Code.”\n\nId.\n\n               2.    The evidence supports the jury’s finding of damages\n                     caused by TWIA’s failure to affirm or deny coverage.\n          As the Insurance Code permits, League City submitted a benefit-of-the-\n\nbargain measure of damages. CR297. The jury awarded $105,778.00 as the sum\n\nof money that would fairly and reasonably compensate League City for its actual\n\ndamages caused by TWIA’s failure to affirm or deny coverage, considering “[t]he\n\ndifference, if any, between the amount that should have been paid by TWIA to\n\nLeague City under the policy and the amount TWIA paid to League City for its\n\nwindstorm damages ($765,200.04).” Id.\n\n\n\n47367_1                               34\n\f          There is ample evidence that had TWIA affirmed coverage within a\n\nreasonable time, League City should and would have been paid at least the\n\nadditional $105,778.00 found by the jury. See New Process Steel Corp. v. Steel\n\nCorp. of Tex., Inc., 703 S.W.2d 209, 216 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1985,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n          Confirming coverage is a priority. RR10:179. TWIA’s duty to determine\n\ncoverage necessarily includes a determination of the amount of damage that was\n\nsustained and covered by the policy. See TIG Ins. Co. v. Via Net, 178 S.W.3d 10,\n\n20 n.9 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005), rev’d on other grounds, 211 S.W.3d\n\n310 (Tex. 2006) (“The term ‘coverage’ in the insurance context ‘normally refers’\n\nto ‘the amount and extent of risk included in the scope of the policy.”) (citing Aid\n\nAss’n for Lutherans v. U.S. Postal Serv., 321 F.3d 1166, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).\n\n          To that end, the field adjuster was charged with contacting the insured,\n\ninspecting the property, and preparing his own independent estimate of covered\n\nlosses. RR11:61, 65-66; 16:50-52, 65-71, 73, 144; 21:203-05. He should have\n\nprepared his own estimate on each item listed on TWIA’s claim acknowledgment\n\nand documented for League City what was and was not being covered. RR11:62-\n\n65; 16:114-17. He need not have and should not have waited on or required the\n\nCity to complete repairs and submit a receipt before determining the existence and\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               35\n\famount of covered losses. RR11:69-70, 93; 13:143-44; 16:68-70, 74, 139, 144;\n\n21:198-99, 204-05.\n\n          Because the adjuster did not properly adjust the claim and prepare estimates,\n\nthere was “[t]oo much delay,” and he could not and did not determine the correct\n\namount of covered damages. RR11:67, 70-71; 12:134, 136-37; 13:13-15, 135-38,\n\n140-44; 16:51, 70-71, 73.\n\n          There would have been no dispute and no lawsuit had the adjuster taken the\n\ninformation he was provided, properly adjusted the claim, and determined the\n\namount of the City’s covered losses. RR15:191-92. “[I]f the documentation had\n\ntaken place at the time the adjuster was out there and the estimates had been\n\nprepared in accordance with what the policy requires in industry standards, we\n\nlikely would not be here today.” RR16:135, 136.\n\n          The connection between TWIA’s failure to affirm coverage and the damages\n\nfound by the jury was clear even to TWIA itself:\n\n          These are the complaints about Paul Gauthier. He didn’t get on any\n          roofs. You’ll hear that he didn’t, quote, “scope,” close quote, every\n          building. You’ll learn what “scoping” means in the insurance\n          adjusting business.\n\n          He did only cursory inspections. He wanted League City to, quote,\n          “adjust its own claim.” And the claim will be that if Paul Gauthier\n          had only looked in 2008 and 2009, he would have found what Paul\n          Tierce, one of the two appraisers, found in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 36\n\fRR7:105; see also RR15:174 (“It was poorly adjusted. And it if had been properly\n\nadjusted, all of these significant damages would have been discovered.”).\n\n          The jury agreed that because TWIA’s adjuster did not properly and timely\n\ndetermine the amount of the City’s covered losses, TWIA failed to identify\n\n$105,778 in additional damages that should have been, but were not, paid to the\n\nCity. CR297. TWIA itself calculated the proper amount that it believed was owed\n\nto League City to be $344,841.75. See RR7:166-67; 27:256-63, and pp. 22-23\n\nabove. The jury’s much smaller award is supported by TWIA’s own calculations\n\nof what TWIA admitted was owed. Id. The court could not grant a take-nothing\n\njudgment in favor of TWIA.          At a minimum, a new trial must be granted.\n\nGuevara, 247 S.W.3d at 670.\n\n          D.    League City is not statutorily prohibited from recovering\n                against TWIA on its Chapter 541 claims.\n          TWIA also tried to escape extra-contractual liability by claiming that,\n\nnotwithstanding express language permitting the City to recover against TWIA\n\nunder chapter 541, the Legislature really meant to prohibit such recovery. CR369-\n\n72.\n\n          Section 2210.552 of the Insurance Code, in effect during the City’s policy\n\nperiod, is unambiguous in specifically allowing Chapter 541 claims against TWIA:\n\n          (a)   Except as provided by Sections 2210.007 and 2210.106, a\n                person insured under this chapter who is aggrieved by an act,\n                ruling, or decision of the [Texas Windstorm Insurance]\n\n47367_1                                37\n\f                association relating to the payment of, the amount of, or the\n                denial of a claim may:\n\n                (1)   bring an action against the association, including an\n                      action under Chapter 541[.]\n\nAct of May 24, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 727, § 2, 2005 Tex.

Laws 5180, 5204.3\n\n          Nothing in the Legislature’s language suggests an intention to grant TWIA\n\nimmunity from Chapter 541 causes of action, which is why League City’s\n\nwindstorm policy expressly states:\n\n          [Y]ou may . . . bring a legal action against us, in accordance with\n          Section 2210.551 and Section 2210.552 of the Texas Insurance Code.\n          Your options under each section are as follows:\n                                            *****\n\n          A person . . . may: (1) bring an action against the association,\n          including an action under Chapter 541[.]\n\nRR27:158.\n\n          This clear text is determinative of intent. State v. Shumake, 199 S.W.3d 279,\n\n284 (Tex. 2006) (“[W]hen possible, we discern [legislative intent] from the plain\n\nmeaning of the words chosen.”). “If a statute is clear and unambiguous, we apply\n\n\n\n3\n  The 2011 repeal of Section 2210.552 applied only to policies delivered, issued for delivery, or\nrenewed by TWIA on or after November 27, 2011, that is, the 60th day after the effective date of\nthe Act (September 28, 2011). See Act of June 28, 2011, 82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 2, § 62(a),\n2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 5180, 5205.\n\n47367_1                                    38\n\fits words according to their common meaning without resort to rules of\n\nconstruction or extrinsic aids.”       In re Estate of Nash, 220 S.W.3d 914, 917\n\n(Tex. 2007).\n\n          Undaunted by the express language of section 2210.552, TWIA argued that\n\nthe Legislature immunized it from chapter 541 claims by enacting provisions\n\npermitting the payment of a chapter 541 judgment only from an insurer’s capital or\n\nsurplus while prohibiting TWIA from maintaining capital or surplus funds.\n\nCR369-71. TWIA’s argument should be rejected.\n\n          First,   TWIA’s   argument    renders   meaningless     section   2210.552’s\n\nauthorization of a suit against TWIA under chapter 541. Such a construction\n\nviolates canons of statutory construction. See Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins, 47\n\nS.W.3d 486, 493 (Tex. 2001) (“We should not give one provision a meaning out of\n\nharmony or inconsistent with other provisions, although it might be susceptible to\n\nsuch a construction standing alone. We must presume that the Legislature intends\n\nan entire statute to be effective and that a just and reasonable result is intended.”).\n\n          Second, when the Legislature intends to immunize TWIA from liability, the\n\nLegislature does so plainly. See, e.g., TEX. INS. CODE §§ 2210.007 (stating TWIA\n\n“is not liable” for certain actions), 2210.572 (stating—with respect to policies\n\nissued 60 days after its effective date of September 28, 2011—TWIA “may not be\n\nheld liable” for certain damages). The court should not interpret the Legislature’s\n\n\n47367_1                                 39\n\fcommands regarding TWIA’s “use [of] the net gain from operations” as a directive\n\nthat TWIA “is not liable” for chapter 541 claims. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical\n\nCo. v. Combs, 340 S.W.3d 432, 439 (Tex. 2011) (“We presume that the Legislature\n\nchooses a statute’s language with care, including each word chosen for a purpose,\n\nwhile purposefully omitting words not chosen.”).\n\n          Third, TWIA fails to address the necessary question that its argument raises:\n\nif TWIA is already immune from all liability under chapter 541, why did the\n\nLegislature enact sections 2210.572, 2210.575, and 2210.576 (establishing\n\nlimitations on recovery)? The Legislature’s acts are not meaningless, and TWIA\n\ncan be liable for League City’s pre-2011 Chapter 541 damage claims.\n\n          Fourth, there is no proof that TWIA lacks “capital or surplus funds.” Texas\n\nInsurance Code section 541.454(a)(1) provides that “civil penalties, premium\n\nrefunds, judgments, compensatory judgments, individual recoveries, orders, class\n\naction awards, costs, damages, or attorney’s fees assessed or awarded” under\n\nChapter 541 “may be paid only from the capital or surplus funds of the offending\n\ninsurer.” TEX. INS. CODE § 541.454(a)(1). TWIA has not provided any factual\n\nsupport or evidence for its contention that it does not maintain a surplus.\n\n          TWIA turns to Texas Insurance Code section 2210.452(c) for its argument\n\nthat “it does not have a surplus.” But here is what section 2210.452(c) states:\n\n          At the end of each calendar year or policy year, the association shall\n          use the net gain from operations of the association, including all\n\n47367_1                                 40\n\f          premium and other revenue of the association in excess of incurred\n          losses, operating expenses, public security obligations, and public\n          security administrative expenses, to make payments to the trust fund,\n          to procure reinsurance, or to make payments to the trust fund and to\n          procure reinsurance.\nTEX. INS. CODE § 2210.452(c).\n\n          Section 2210.452(c) does not even use the word “surplus.” It only addresses\n\n“net gain from operations” as the amount to be paid into the trust fund or to be paid\n\nfor reinsurance. It does not define or specify that “operations” have to exclude\n\nlosses in the form of liability as a result of poor adjustment of claims under policies\n\nissued prior to September 28, 2011. Moreover, it requires only that TWIA use any\n\nnet gain from operations for payments to the trust fund or for reinsurance at “the\n\nend of each calendar year or policy year.”              Nothing prohibits TWIA from\n\nmaintaining a “surplus” throughout the year from which it would be able to pay a\n\njury award of damages under Chapter 541.\n\n          Accordingly, the trial court could not disregard the jury’s findings that:\n\n               TWIA failed to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable\n                time;\n\n               TWIA’s failure to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable\n                time was an unfair or deceptive act or practice; and\n\n               TWIA’s unfair or deceptive act or practice caused damages to\n                League City in the amount of $105,778.00.\nCR296-98.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   41\n\f          E.    League City’s extra-contractual claims are not barred by\n                limitations.\n          TWIA bore the burden to plead, prove, and secure findings to sustain its\n\nlimitations defense.      Cooke v. Morrison, 404 S.W.3d 100, 113 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.). This burden included establishing when League\n\nCity’s cause of action accrued. Id.\n\n          TWIA did not request a jury question on its limitations defense, even though\n\nthe trial court advised TWIA that a fact issue existed. RR20:26-27. As the trial\n\ncourt ruled, the September 2009 email from TWIA’s adjuster does not\n\nconclusively establish TWIA’s limitations defense. Id.; see RR29:506. The email\n\ndoes not “den[y] League City’s claims beyond the amount it had already agreed to\n\npay on September 21, 2009.”           Compare CR381 and RR29:506.          The email\n\nforwards “the current claim summary” with “the current total claim amount for\n\neach of the locations.” RR29:506 (emphasis added). It advises “that there may be\n\nsome claim issues that have not yet been submitted by your administrators, but\n\nwould be considered for coverage . . . .” Id. And it directs League City to “submit\n\nall future claim documentation through your current agent who will forward to\n\nTWIA.” Id. The adjuster’s email does not establish League City’s claim has been\n\nconcluded. RR13:69. While the email identifies certain locations for which there\n\nis “NO COV,” League City has not sought to recover damages associated with any\n\nof those locations.\n\n47367_1                                 42\n\f          Moreover, TWIA’s corporate representative was adamant that League City’s\n\nclaim remained opened after September 2009. RR7:233-34, 249; 9:62. “[T]he\n\nclaim itself is still open.” RR9:65. TWIA made a supplemental payment on May\n\n13, 2010, and the claim remained open at least through September 2010. RR9:65-\n\n71; 12:175-76; 29:528-29. The claim was perhaps closed at some point after\n\nSeptember 2010, but even then the claim was reopened when the City requested an\n\nextension, and TWIA made another supplemental payment in October 2011.\n\nRR9:75-76, 80-81; see RR29:519, 527 (explaining “final adjustment of your\n\nclaim”). League City filed suit three months later. CR7.\n\n          TWIA did not conclusively establish that League City’s claim was denied or\n\nclosed more than two years before January 17, 2012. See CR7. TWIA waived its\n\nlimitations defense by not obtaining the necessary finding. TEX. R. CIV. P. 279;\n\nPrestige Ford Garland Ltd. P’ship v. Morales, 336 S.W.3d 833, 836 (Tex.

Shelton, 889\n\nS.W.2d 278, 283 (Tex. 1994).\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 43\n\f          TWIA’s assertion that the good faith and fair dealing claim fails once the\n\nbreach of contract claim is rejected, CR372, is wrong. TWIA is not entitled to\n\nrendition on League City’s contract claim. See Section II. This is not a case in\n\nwhich TWIA denied a claim that is not covered; the jury found that TWIA\n\nbreached the policy. See CR289; Section III.B.\n\n          TWIA owes League City a duty of good faith and fair dealing as a matter of\n\nlaw. Chitsey v. Nat’l Lloyds Ins. Co., 738 S.W.2d 641, 643 & n.1 (Tex. 1987);\n\nArnold v. Nat’l County Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 725 S.W.2d 165, 167 (Tex. 1987).\n\nLeague City’s claim does not sound only in contract.           Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v.\n\nDeLanney, 809 S.W.2d 493, 494 & n.1 (Tex. 1991). Furthermore, League City is\n\nentitled to recover all damages proximately caused by TWIA’s breach of its duty,\n\nincluding policy benefits wrongfully withheld. Waite Hill, 959 S.W.2d at 184-85;\n\nChitsey, 738 S.W.2d at 643-44; Vail, 754 S.W.2d at 136.\n\n          There is at least some evidence that TWIA failed to comply with its duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing. See pp. 1-5 above. TWIA has never addressed the\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s finding, but instead argued that the jury’s answers to\n\nother questions in the charge prove it had a reasonable basis for failing to\n\nreasonably investigate the claim and for failing to attempt to effectuate a prompt,\n\nfair, and equitable settlement once its liability had become reasonably clear.\n\nCR372-73. There are several problems with TWIA’s argument.\n\n\n47367_1                                 44\n\f          First, absent a (preserved) complaint that two jury findings conflict, “there is\n\nno basis for reconciling the jury’s responses, and the court must give effect to each\n\nfinding in the ordinary fashion.” Springs Window Fashions Div., Inc. v. Blind\n\nMaker, Inc., 184 S.W.3d 840, 867 (Tex. App.—Austin 2006, pet. granted, judgm’t\n\nvacated w.r.m.). TWIA did not object to any allegedly conflicting jury findings\n\nbefore the jury was discharged, so there is no basis for TWIA’s speculation about\n\nwhat the jury intended by its other answers. Id.\n\n          Second, the duty of good faith and fair dealing “emanates not from the terms\n\nof the insurance contract, but from the obligation imposed in law[.]” Viles, 788\n\nS.W.2d at 567. Consequently, League City’s purported failure to comply with the\n\ninsurance policy does not conclusively defeat its ability to recover. Id. (holding\n\nthat the insureds “were not required to submit to the jury questions as to\n\ncompliance with the proof of loss condition contained in their homeowner’s\n\npolicies, or alternatively a waiver thereof, as a prerequisite to maintaining a\n\nsuccessful suit for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing”).\n\n          Third, the jury findings on TWIA’s defenses are immaterial and unsupported\n\nfor the reasons discussed in section V. Thus, those jury findings cannot be a basis\n\nfor disregarding the jury’s unrelated findings that TWIA breached its duty of good\n\nfaith and fair dealing.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   45\n\f          There is also at least some evidence that had TWIA conducted a reasonable\n\ninvestigation and attempted in good faith to effectuate a prompt, fair, and equitable\n\nsettlement of League City’s claim, TWIA should and would have paid League City\n\nan additional $105,778 for its windstorm damages. CR304. TWIA’s corporate\n\nrepresentative analyzed the appraisers’ estimates, the adjuster’s file, all the\n\nphotographs, and the engineering reports; applied all the policy terms and\n\nconditions; deducted prior payments and deductibles; and determined TWIA owed\n\nan additional $344,841.75 for League City’s Hurricane Ike damage. RR7:166-67;\n\n8:109-16; 10:138-40; 27:256-63. The jury “absolutely” was capable of conducting\n\nthe same analysis and arriving at its own (smaller) number. RR8:116.\n\n          Finally, League City’s claim is not barred by limitations. See Section III.E.\n\nV.        The Jury Findings on TWIA’s Alleged Defenses Do Not Support\n          Rendition of a Take Nothing Judgment.\n          In seeking a take-nothing judgment, TWIA argued that the jury findings on\n\nits alleged defenses entirely or partially excused TWIA’s performance under the\n\ninsurance policy and defeated League City’s extra-contractual claims. CR374-77.\n\nBut TWIA did not obtain a jury finding on excuse; TWIA did not conclusively\n\nestablish that the City’s alleged breach occurred first; and TWIA elected to treat\n\nthe contract as continuing. The jury findings on TWIA’s defenses do not support\n\nrendition of judgment against League City.\n\n\n\n47367_1                                  46\n\f          A.    TWIA elected to treat the contract as continuing.\n          It is certainly true that a prior material breach by one party can excuse\n\nanother party from performing under a contract.           Long Trusts v. Griffin, 222\n\nS.W.3d 412, 415 (Tex. 2006). It is equally true, however, that “[a] party who\n\nelects to treat a contract as continuing deprives himself of any excuse for ceasing\n\nperformance on his own part.” Id. (citation omitted); see Henry v. Masson, 333\n\nS.W.3d 825, 842 n.3 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n          “If after a party breaches a contract, the other party continues to insist on\n\nperformance on the part of the party in default, the previous breach constitutes no\n\nexcuse for nonperformance on the part of the party not in default and the contract\n\ncontinues in force for the benefit of both parties.” Houston Belt & Terminal Ry.\n\nCo. v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 421 S.W.2d 431, 435 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1967, writ ref’d n.r.e.). “The non-breaching party must thus elect between\n\ntwo courses of action—continuing performance under the contract or ceasing to\n\nperform.” Henry, 333 S.W.3d at 840; see Man Indus. (India) Ltd. v. Midcontinent\n\nExpress Pipeline, LLC, 407 S.W.3d 342, 368 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2013, pet. denied). “Seeking to benefit from the contract after the breach operates\n\nas a conclusive choice depriving the non-breaching party of an excuse for his own\n\nnon-performance.” Henry, 333 S.W.3d at 841.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 47\n\f          Assuming, for the moment, that League City materially breached the\n\ninsurance policy by failing to provide TWIA notice and/or repair receipts, TWIA\n\nindisputably treated the contract as continuing long after any purported breach.\n\n          League City submitted its First Notice of Loss—which reported “wind\n\ndamage to various locations”—on September 15, 2008, two days after Ike.\n\nRR27:211. After receiving League City’s notice, TWIA did not advise League\n\nCity that its notice was insufficient, did not deny the claim, and did not terminate\n\nthe policy. RR14:40, 43-44; 16:151. Instead, TWIA acknowledged “the claim” in\n\nwriting, assigned a single claim number, identified 140 “Insured Propert[ies]”\n\nunder the policy, and described the loss as “Hurricane Ike Damage.” RR8:168;\n\n27:212-14. TWIA then hired an adjuster “to go out and adjust the loss.” RR8:166,\n\n176.\n\n          Thereafter, TWIA continued to demand performance: requesting and\n\nobtaining inspections, meetings, receipts, and documentation from League City—\n\nall without any complaint about notice or any reservation of rights. RR8:167, 176,\n\n178-79, 222; 12:24-27, 30, 35-37, 55, 81, 97-99, 117-18; 13:90-92, 108, 125-26,\n\n133,156-58, 207-08, 210-11, 216; 14:51-53, 83, 96-97; 27:161-84. TWIA waived\n\nproof of loss, in accordance with the policy. RR8:148-49; 10:206-07. And TWIA\n\nmade payments to League City—taking advantage of the policy’s terms and\n\nconditions—in 2009, 2010, and 2011. RR8:57-58; 9:46-47; 52:772-74.\n\n\n47367_1                              48\n\f          Later, despite TWIA’s contention that League City had failed to comply\n\n“with policy conditions 4.a [League City’s duties after loss], 10 [the appraisal\n\nprovision] and 12 [dispute resolution],” TWIA demanded League City’s\n\nparticipation in an appraisal.     RR52:779-82; 9:94-97.    An appraisal was not\n\nmandatory under the policy, and TWIA did not have to seek appraisal; but it did.\n\nRR27:157; 52:781-82.        At the same time, TWIA “continue[d] to request that\n\n[League City] provide us with prompt written notice, include a description of the\n\nproperty involved, and all pertinent records and documents we have requested\n\n. . . .” RR52:781-82. And TWIA insisted: “[W]e do not intend to waive any\n\nterms, exclusions or conditions contained in the policy[.]” RR52:782.\n\n          TWIA treated the contract as continuing even after League City filed suit\n\nand even after TWIA believed League City was in breach, and by doing so, TWIA\n\nrequired that League City continue to perform under the contract. Id. League City\n\nwas required to spend over $150,000 in appraisal fees and expenses. CR552.\n\n          Assuming League City’s alleged breaches—of failing to provide notice and\n\nreceipts—were prior and material, TWIA was “entitled to terminate the agreement\n\nand sue for breach.” Long Trusts, 222 S.W.3d at 415. “But ‘[a] party who elects\n\nto treat a contract as continuing deprives himself of any excuse for ceasing\n\nperformance on his own part.’” Id. By continually demanding performance from\n\nLeague City—including League City’s participation in an appraisal under the\n\n\n47367_1                                49\n\fpolicy—TWIA deprived itself of any excuse for its own non-performance. Henry,\n\n333 S.W.3d at 841; Man Indus., 407 S.W.3d at 368; Gupta v. E. Idaho Tumor Inst.,\n\nInc., 140 S.W.3d 747, 757-58 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n          There is no special rule for insurance policies that allows TWIA to continue\n\nto demand performance from League City while avoiding its own contractual\n\nobligations. “Insurance policies are contracts, and as such are subject to rules\n\napplicable to contracts generally.” Hernandez v. Gulf Group Lloyds, 875 S.W.2d\n\n691, 692 (Tex. 1994). TWIA seeks to enforce a “fundamental principle of contract\n\nlaw”—not just insurance law. Id.; see also Greene v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 446\n\nS.W.3d 761, 768 (Tex. 2014) (“In Hernandez we applied the contract principle that\n\nonly when one party commits a material breach is the other party’s performance\n\nexcused. That principle was the basis for our decisions in PAJ, Prodigy, and\n\nLennar.”) (citation omitted).\n\n          A corollary to that fundamental principle of contract law is “another equally\n\nfundamental principle”—“when one party materially breaches a contract, the\n\nnonbreaching party must choose whether to treat the contract as terminated or as\n\ncontinuing.” Man Indus., 407 S.W.3d at 368.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 50\n\f          The supreme court had no reason to reach the fundamental principle at issue\n\nin this case when it decided Hernandez or PAJ, Inc. v. Hanover Insurance Co., 243\n\nS.W.3d 630 (Tex. 2008). The insurers in PAJ and Hernandez each elected to stand\n\non the alleged breach and denied the insured’s claim. See PAJ, 243 S.W.3d at 631;\n\nHernandez, 875 S.W.2d at 692. The insurers did not accept the claim, investigate,\n\nmake payments, and demand appraisal under the policy. Id. So the supreme court\n\nwas not faced with an insurer who elected to treat the contract as continuing after\n\nthe insured’s alleged breach had occurred. Id.\n\n          Nothing in the supreme court’s opinion in PAJ (or in any other case)\n\nsuggests a willingness to enforce the rule that a prior material breach by one\n\ncontracting party excuses performance by the opposite party, while eschewing the\n\nequivalent rule that one who elects to treat the contract as continuing deprives\n\nhimself of any excuse for ceasing his own performance. See Long Trusts, 222\n\nS.W.3d at 415.\n\n          In this case, because TWIA elected to treat the contract as continuing, any\n\nprevious breach by League City constitutes “no excuse for nonperformance” on the\n\npart of TWIA as a matter of law. Henry, 333 S.W.3d at 840; see Gupta, 140\n\nS.W.3d at 756. Consequently, the jury’s answers to questions 18 through 21\n\nshould be disregarded as immaterial. Judgment should be rendered in favor of\n\nLeague City or a new trial should be granted on all issues.\n\n\n47367_1                                 51\n\f          B.    The questions on notice and receipts were improperly\n                submitted.\n          If TWIA’s excuse defense is not defeated as a matter of law by TWIA’s\n\ncontinuing performance, League City is entitled to rendition of judgment or a new\n\ntrial because TWIA failed to obtain the findings necessary to establish its defense,\n\nand League City objected to TWIA’s failure to obtain the requisite findings. See\n\nRR22:12-14, 16-18.\n\n          “[T]he contention that a party to a contract is excused from performance\n\nbecause of a prior material breach by the other party is an affirmative defense.”\n\nTriton 88, L.P. v. Star Elec., L.L.C., 411 S.W.3d 42, 58 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2013, no pet.) (citation omitted). In order to rely upon the defense, TWIA\n\nwas required to secure all necessary findings. See AMS Constr. Co. v. K.H.K.\n\nScaffolding Houston, Inc., 357 S.W.3d 30, 43 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n2011, pet. dism’d). TWIA failed to do so.\n\n          In response to question 1, the jury found that TWIA failed to comply with\n\nthe insurance policy. CR289. As the record reflects, TWIA failed to request a jury\n\nquestion asking whether TWIA’s failure to comply with the insurance policy was\n\nexcused. CR289-322; cf. TEXAS PATTERN JURY CHARGES—BUS., CONSUMER, INS.\n\n& EMPLOYMENT PJC 101.21, 101.59 (2014) (identifying the “controlling question”\n\nwhen insurer raises excuse defense). League City therefore objected to the charge\n\nbecause it failed to ask the jury the controlling excuse question. RR22:13, 17.\n\n47367_1                                52\n\fLeague City also objected to questions 18 and 20 on the ground that they did not\n\ndetermine whether League City’s alleged failure to give notice or provide receipts\n\nwas a prior breach. Id. Although not its burden, League City also requested a\n\nquestion on excuse. CR333; RR22:23. The trial court overruled League City’s\n\nobjections and refused its tendered question. CR333, RR22:14, 18.\n\n          Despite TWIA’s assertion that the jury’s findings in response to questions 18\n\nthrough 21 excuse TWIA’s failure to comply with the insurance policy in whole or\n\nin part, nothing in question 18 or in question 20 (which asked whether League City\n\nfailed to provide notice and failed to provide receipts) was tied in any way to\n\nquestion 1 (which asked whether TWIA failed to comply with the insurance\n\npolicy). RR22:13, 17. Neither question 18 nor 20 identified the breach by TWIA\n\nthat League City’s failures were supposed to excuse. CR311, 316. And neither\n\nquestion required the jury to determine whether League City’s failure to provide\n\nnotice or receipts occurred prior to TWIA’s own failure to comply with the policy.\n\nId.\n\n          It is not undisputed that League City’s failure to provide notice or receipts\n\noccurred before TWIA’s failure to timely and properly investigate, adjust, estimate\n\nand pay for League City’s losses. Post-trial, TWIA argued that League City’s\n\nfailure to give notice occurred on September 15, 2008, when League City\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 53\n\fsubmitted its First Notice of Loss.              CR806-07.     But that was not the notice\n\nargument TWIA made at trial.4\n\n          At trial, TWIA’s corporate representative swore that he was not criticizing\n\nLeague City for failing to identify every potential loss location on its First Notice\n\nof Loss. RR10:189. A TWIA claims supervisor testified that League City’s First\n\nNotice of Claim was typical of the notices TWIA received, and that it was\n\nsufficient to put TWIA on notice. RR14:43-44.\n\n          TWIA’s corporate representative opined that “the duty to provide notice of a\n\nclaim” included the obligation to provide on-going information on additional\n\ndamage, hidden damage, and additional costs.                  RR8:231; 9:28-30.          And he\n\ncriticized League City because “[t]here was no contact from the City at all\n\nregarding any kind of damage, additional damage that wasn’t addressed.” RR9:37-\n\n38; see also RR9:67-68, 70. TWIA “had no indication that there were ongoing\n\nproblems with the roof [on City Hall, the municipal court, or the library]. We had\n\nno indication that they required replacement. No contact whatsoever.” RR8:216.\n\n          In questioning City employees, TWIA similarly emphasized its theory that\n\nthe City failed to provide written notice and repair receipts as the City repaired\n\nleaks in 2009. E.g., RR15:123-26, 131-33.\n\n4\n  If the City’s failure to provide notice occurred on September 15, 2008 when it provided its First\nNotice of Loss, then TWIA indisputably elected to treat the policy as continuing and cannot use\nthe City’s alleged breach as an excuse for its own non-performance. See section V.A.\n\n47367_1                                     54\n\f          TWIA also repeatedly complained that League City did not provide notice\n\nbefore filing suit in 2012. E.g., RR9:86-87, 94-97; 10:88, 90-91, 117, 136-37.\n\nAccording to TWIA, failing to give pre-suit notice “goes back to the very\n\nconditions that we talked about yesterday about providing notice of the claim,\n\ndocumenting loss, et cetera[.]” RR9:95.\n\n          TWIA emphasized its contention that League City had an ongoing duty to\n\nprovide notice and receipts in closing argument:\n\n              “Not one witness has stood up here and said, ‘Here’s a covered\n               cost that we submitted, we identified, that we brought it to\n               somebody’s attention hasn’t been paid. Not one receipt that we\n               submitted that wasn’t paid.’” RR22:94.\n\n              “Not once did they pick up the phone and say, ‘We’ve got a\n               problem.’” RR22:95.\n\n              “We don’t have a single new receipt, a single maintenance\n               record for all those repairs you saw have been made.”\n               RR22:95.\n\n              “[T]hey sued without making any notice.” RR22:95.\n\n              “The lawsuit that was filed, instead of picking up the phone or\n               sending an email or writing a letter…which is what all of you\n               guys would have done if this had been your home, your office,\n               your facility….” RR22:97.\n\n              “What we’re saying is Texas Windstorm didn’t have a chance\n               to address those damages because either, A, when they said\n               they were giving us receipts they didn’t give them or, B, when\n               the damages were found, nobody told us. And all we ask for,\n               all the policy requires is notice. And then we’ll react.\n               RR22:101.\n\n\n\n47367_1                                55\n\f               “[T]hat’s not fair to ask Texas Windstorm to pay for those.\n                They weren’t even told about them. Make them go make a\n                proper claim and then we’ll see.” RR22:103.\n\n               “If they didn’t say anything then, how fair is it to come in and\n                say it now after you filed a lawsuit, you waited over three and a\n                half years to raise your issues? And more importantly, when\n                we talk about that, is it timely? I mean, is it timely? Is that\n                prompt notice, written notice of a claim as required by an\n                insurance policy that you’ve heard about?” RR22:113.\n          While TWIA emphasized League City’s on-going failures to provide notice\n\nand receipts in the years following Ike and before suit was filed, the jury heard a\n\ngreat deal of evidence regarding TWIA’s failure to investigate and adjust the\n\nCity’s claim immediately after Ike.\n\n          A TWIA claims supervisor testified that “the purpose of sending an adjuster\n\nto the property is that they’re qualified to inspect, note the damages, figure out\n\nwhat’s covered and not covered, and generate an estimate for the cost of repairs or\n\nreplacement.”       RR21:203-04.     TWIA acknowledged that it was obligated to\n\ninvestigate anything the insured reports.         RR10:91.    Nonetheless, while the\n\nspreadsheets provided to TWIA document “obvious roof leak[s]” to various\n\nstructures, the adjuster never got on the roofs, inspected the damage, or estimated\n\nthe losses. RR12:188-90; 13:12-15, 29-30, 67; 14:157, 162-63. By August 4,\n\n2009, there was no excuse and no lack of information that kept the adjuster from\n\ncompleting the field portion of League City’s claim. RR21:202.\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 56\n\f          While it is fine for the adjuster to request information and have the City fill\n\nout spreadsheets, that does not replace the adjuster’s obligation to personally\n\ninspect and scope the loss and estimate the cost of repair. RR16:70-71, 74;\n\n21:198-99. Paying on receipts did not “excuse[] all of what had transpired over the\n\ncourse of the claim handling in the first year before [the adjuster] wrote any\n\nestimates.” RR16:138. If the adjuster had prepared estimates when he initially\n\nwent out to the League City structures, the lawsuit likely would never have\n\noccurred. RR16:136; 15:191-92; 14:162-63.\n\n          There is conflicting testimony about the timing of TWIA’s and League\n\nCity’s alleged failures to comply with the policy. Yet TWIA refused to ask the\n\njury whether TWIA’s failure to comply was excused, or whether League City’s\n\nalleged failures to comply occurred prior to TWIA’s failure to comply. CR286-\n\n324, 333; RR22:12-14, 16-18. In light of the evidence, the trial court could not\n\ndeem a finding on these contested issues in TWIA’s favor. TEX. R. CIV. P. 279.\n\n          A question or an element omitted from the charge by the party with the\n\nburden of proof cannot be deemed in that party’s favor when the other party\n\nobjected. State Dep’t of Highways & Pub. Transp. v. Payne, 838 S.W.2d 235, 241\n\n(Tex. 1992); Winfield v. Renfro, 821 S.W.2d 640, 657 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1991, writ denied). “[W]hen an issue is submitted with a missing element,\n\nand the party who did not have the burden of proof objects, the appellate court\n\n\n47367_1                                  57\n\fmust reverse and render, not reverse and remand for a new trial.” Winfield, 821\n\nS.W.2d at 657; see Payne, 838 S.W.2d at 241.\n\n          Only a prior material breach could excuse TWIA’s failure to comply with\n\nthe insurance policy.     See Mustang Pipeline Co. v. Driver Pipeline Co., 134\n\nS.W.3d 195, 200 (Tex. 2004); Mead v. Johnson Group, Inc., 615 S.W.2d 685, 689\n\n(Tex. 1981). Because League City objected to TWIA’s failure to obtain a finding\n\non excuse or even a finding that the failures inquired about in questions 18 and 20\n\noccurred prior to TWIA’s own failure to comply with the insurance policy,\n\nRR22:13, 17, League City is entitled to rendition of judgment in its favor. Payne,\n\n838 S.W.2d at 241; Winfield, 821 S.W.2d at 657. At a minimum the defective\n\nsubmission requires a new trial.\n\n          C.   League City complied with the policy’s notice requirement\n               as a matter of law, or TWIA waived the notice requirement\n               as a matter of law.\n          Following Ike, League City provided written notice on TWIA’s “First\n\nNotice of Loss-Claims Reporting Form” on September 15, 2008, two days after the\n\nstorm. See RR27:211. The City’s written notice identifies the insured, policy\n\nnumber, policy period, and date of loss, and it describes the losses as “Wind\n\nDamage to Various Locations.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               58\n\f          League City’s notice satisfied the policy requirement as a matter of law—as\n\nTWIA determined at the time League City’s performance under the policy was\n\nrequired. RR14:43-44; 11:61-63; 16:151; 10:188-90. TWIA voiced no complaint\n\nor criticism about the notice. RR16:151; 14:43-44; 10:188-89. TWIA accepted\n\nand acknowledged League City’s notice with its “Claim Notice Acknowledgment\n\nand Assignment,” in which it described the City’s loss as “Hurricane Ike Damage”\n\nand listed all 140 items covered under the policy. RR10:185, 189-90; 27:212.\n\nTWIA opened a claim with a single claim number, assigned an adjuster, assigned a\n\nsupervisor, and set an initial loss reserve. RR10:189-90; 11:61-63; 14:43-44;\n\n27:212; 52:174. Ultimately, TWIA “received and accepted” the adjuster’s reports\n\nand acknowledged covered damage to the Library, Gazebo, City Hall, Council\n\nChambers, Council Chambers CTS, Civic Center, Community Center, Museum\n\nStorage Bldg., and Fire Station 2. RR29:498.\n\n          In closing, TWIA did not dispute that it received proper notice regarding\n\nthese items:\n\n          I think the evidence shows there are eight items on the appraisal\n          award where they did give proper notice. And there’s a couple of\n          pages and you will see it when you go through. But it’s a library, the\n          park gazebo, it’s the ones that you see in Exhibit 16. It’s the ones that\n          we’ve been looking at. It’s the ones we paid money on. It’s the ones\n          that we received claim information on. The one we received receipts\n          and work orders on. . . . You compare Exhibit 16 with Question 18\n          and you will know how to answer it. It’s the covered items that were\n          reported.\n\n\n47367_1                                  59\n\fRR22:151-52.\n\n          League City satisfied the policy’s notice requirement as a matter of law and\n\nthe jury’s contrary findings in answer to question 18 are supported by no evidence.\n\nAlternatively, TWIA waived compliance with the policy’s notice requirement as a\n\nmatter of law. See Jernigan v. Langley, 111 S.W.3d 153, 156-57 (Tex. 2003)\n\n(holding waiver is “an intentional relinquishment of a known right or intentional\n\nconduct inconsistent with claiming that right” and presents a question of law\n\n“when the surrounding facts and circumstances are undisputed”). At a minimum,\n\nthe jury’s findings are against the great weight and overwhelming preponderance\n\nof the evidence and require a new trial.\n\n          D.    The jury’s answers to question 20 support rendition of\n                judgment in League City’s favor.\n          In response to question 20, the jury determined that League City did not fail\n\nto provide TWIA with an accurate record of repair expenses for the Library, Pool\n\npump building, Park gazebo, City Hall, Council Chambers, Civic Center,\n\nCommunity Center, Museum Storage Bldg., and Fire Station 2. CR316-17. TWIA\n\ndid not ask the trial court to disregard these findings, CR377, and the trial court did\n\nnot disregard them. CR678-79.\n\n          The jury findings as to these nine items—coupled with the evidence proving\n\nTWIA’s receipt or waiver of notice concerning these items—requires rendition of\n\njudgment in favor of League City. The jury’s liability and damage awards are\n\n47367_1                                 60\n\fsupported by the evidence even if the Court considers only TWIA’s actions with\n\nrespect to these policy items.\n\nVI.       If a New Trial Is Not Granted, League City Is Entitled to Recover\n          Attorney’s Fees.\n          Because League City is entitled to recover on its breach of contract and\n\nInsurance Code claims, the City is entitled to recover its attorney’s fees. TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE § 38.001; TEX. INS. CODE § 541.152.\n\n          The jury’s award of $770,561 in fees for representation in the trial court is\n\namply supported by the testimony of Randal Cashiola.             RR19:160-210.      He\n\ndiscussed the Arthur Anderson factors, the necessary work done in the case, the\n\nqualifications and rates of the attorneys and paralegals, and required segregation.\n\nId.       He suggested a reasonable award through trial would be $1,464,065.90.\n\nRR19:210. The jury awarded only a little over half that amount. CR309.\n\n          The jury’s answers to subparts (b) through (e) of Question No. 17 finding\n\nthat $0 is a reasonable fee for the necessary services of League City’s attorneys for\n\nan appeal to the court of appeals and for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas\n\nshould be disregarded. Mr. Cashiola established that the reasonable and necessary\n\nfee for an appeal to the court of appeals was $50,000. RR19:211-12. Mr. Cashiola\n\nfurther established that the reasonable and necessary fee for an appeal to the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas was $35,000. RR19:215. Mr. Cashiola’s testimony was\n\nuncontroverted.\n\n47367_1                                 61\n\f          The Court may disregard a jury’s zero award of attorney’s fees and\n\nsubstitute an affirmative finding if the evidence conclusively establishes the\n\naffirmative finding. See Brown v. Bank of Galveston, 963 S.W.2d 511, 515 (Tex.\n\n1998), abrogated on other grounds by Ford Motor Co. v. Ledesma, 242 S.W.3d 32\n\n(Tex. 2007) (“We also hold that the court of appeals properly awarded attorney’s\n\nfees because the [plaintiff] established the amount.           The [plaintiff] offered\n\nuncontradicted testimony on the amount of its attorney’s fees. [Defendant] had the\n\nmeans and opportunity of disproving the testimony and failed to do so.”); Ragsdale\n\nv. Progressive Voters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 882 (Tex. 1990) (holding that a\n\ncourt may award attorneys’ fees as a matter of law when the testimony on fees “is\n\nnot contradicted by any other witness, or attendant circumstances, and the same is\n\nclear, direct and positive, and free from contradiction, inaccuracies, and\n\ncircumstances tending to cast suspicion thereon”). That is the situation here.\n\n          Alternatively, if the amount of reasonable and necessary appellate attorney’s\n\nfees is not established as a matter of law, the Court should disregard the zero\n\nfindings and grant a new trial on the appellate attorney’s fee issues. Smith v.\n\nPatrick W.Y. Tam Trust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 548-49 (Tex. 2009). The jury’s $0\n\nanswers are supported by legally or factually insufficient evidence. The Court\n\nshould therefore grant a new trial. Id. When, as here, “attorney’s fees are proper\n\nunder section 38.001(8), the trial court has no discretion to deny them.” Id. at 547.\n\n\n47367_1                                 62\n\f                                        PRAYER\n          The trial court’s judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted on all\n\nissues. Alternatively, judgment should be rendered in favor of League City. If\n\nappellate attorney’s fees are not established as a matter of law, a new trial should\n\nbe granted on that issue. Appellant, League City, also respectfully prays for all\n\nrelief to which it is entitled.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 63\n\f                          Respectfully Submitted,\n\nTHE MOSTYN LAW FIRM                   HOGAN & HOGAN\n\nGregory F.

You may discuss the case with other jurors only\nwhen you are all together in the jury room.\n       Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss-the-case-with anyone else,-either in —\nperson or by any other means. Do not do any independent investigation about the case or conduct\nany research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post\ninformation about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences\nwith the other jurors. Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your\ndeliberations for any reason. I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of\nan emergency.\n        Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your notes back\ninto the jury room and consult them during deliberations; but do not show or read your notes to\nyour fellow jurors during your deliberations. Your notes are not evidence. Each of you should\nrely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that\nanother juror has or has not taken notes.\n\n        You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating. The bailiff will\ngive your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you. I will make sure your notes are\nkept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone. After you complete your\ndeliberations, the bailiff will collect your notes. When you are released from jury duty, the bailiff\nwill promptly destroy your notes so that nobody can read what you wrote.\n\fHere are the instructions for answering the questions.\n          Do not let-bias T-prejudiee, or-sympathy play any part in your decision.\n\n   2.     Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that is in\n          these instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was\n          not admitted in the courtroom.\n    3.    You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of the\n          credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters\n          of law, you must follow all of my instructions.\n\n   4.     If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary meaning,\n          use the meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n    57- All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question\n         or answer is not important.\n\n    6.    Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"yes\"\n          answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told\n          otherwise. Whenever a question requires an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your\n          answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence- unless-you are told\n          otherwise\n    7.    The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of credible\n          evidence presented in this case. If you do not find that a preponderance of the\n          evidence supports a \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" A preponderance of the\n          evidence is not measured by tbe number_ofitnesses__or by the number of\n          documents admitted in evidence. For ...a fact to be proved by a preponderance of the\n          evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely true than not true.\n\n    8.    A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both.\n          A fact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or\n          by witnesses who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established\n             eircumstantig-evidence When it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from\n          other facts proved.\n    9.    Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then\n          just answer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question carefully\n          without considering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your\n          answers will have.\n\n    10.    Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance.\n    11.    Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount.

Following the\n                                             appraisal, TWIA refused to pay the award,\n                                             and a jury trial followed.\n\nTrial Court:                                 Hon.

Whether League City is entitled to a new trial because the jury question on\n\nthe validity of the appraisal award was improperly submitted.\n\n3.        Whether League City is entitled to a new trial in the interest of justice\n\nbecause the jury found the appraisal award failed to comply with policy terms and\n\nconditions.\n\n4.        Whether League City is entitled to a new trial because the jury charge\n\nshifted the burden of proving the amount of loss to League City, contrary to the\n\nterms of the appraisal provision.\n\n5.        Whether the trial court correctly disregarded the jury’s contract and damages\n\nfindings (in response to questions 1 and 3) as immaterial or supported by legally\n\ninsufficient evidence.\n\n6.

Whether the trial court should have disregarded the jury’s answers to the\n\nquestions on notice, repair receipts, and prejudice because TWIA elected to treat\n\nthe policy as continuing.\n\n11.       Whether League City is entitled to rendition of judgment in its favor or a\n\nnew trial because the jury questions on notice, repair receipts, and prejudice were\n\nimproperly submitted.\n\n12.       Whether League City is entitled to a new trial because the trial court\n\noverruled League City’s objections to the questions on notice and receipts, refused\n\nto submit League City’s requested question on excuse, and/or refused League\n\nCity’s requested instruction on TWIA’s election to treat the insurance policy as\n\ncontinuing.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 xv\n\f13.

Whether TWIA conclusively established its limitations defense to League\n\nCity’s extra-contractual claims.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               xvi\n\f                             STATEMENT OF FACTS\n          Hurricane Ike struck on September 13, 2008. RR14:84. Two days later,\n\nLeague City provided written notice on TWIA’s “First Notice of Loss-Claims\n\nReporting Form.” RR27:211. League City described its loss as “Wind Damage to\n\nVarious Locations” and identified the insured, policy number, policy period, and\n\ndate of loss.\n\n          TWIA raised no complaint about notice. RR14:43-44; 11:61-63; 10:188-90;\n\n16:151. Instead, TWIA accepted and acknowledged League City’s notice, opened\n\na claim with a single claim number, assigned an adjuster and supervisor, and set an\n\ninitial loss reserve. RR10:188-90; 11:61-63; 14:43-44; 27:212; 52:174. TWIA’s\n\nClaim Notice Acknowledgment listed all 140 items covered under the policy and\n\ndescribed the City’s loss as “Hurricane Ike Damage.” RR27:212.\n\n          According to the TWIA supervisor assigned to League City’s claim, the\n\nadjuster who received TWIA’s Acknowledgment should have inspected the listed\n\nitems and prepared an estimate on each one. RR11:61-63, 66. The adjuster could\n\nnot just “overlook” an item. RR11:64-65. Unless the insured said there was no\n\ndamage to a particular facility, TWIA’s policies required the adjuster to inspect\n\nand prepare estimates for each property. RR11:66, 104-05; 16:189. According to\n\nthe TWIA claims manual: “The adjuster is expected to personally inspect and\n\nscope the loss.” RR30:297. Likewise, “Adjusters are expected to make their own\n\n\n47367_1                                1\n\festimates. . . . There should be a separate estimate per each item of insurance\n\ninvolved and the estimates should be clearly marked as to which item they\n\nrepresent.” RR30:299.\n\n          Nothing about the League City claim took it outside the requirements of\n\nTWIA’s claims manual. RR11:59. League City’s claim should have been handled\n\nunder the same guidelines and in the same manner as any other claim. RR11:60.\n\n          But it was not. RR11:65-67, 70-72; 13:91-92; 14:162-63; 16:60, 64-65, 68,\n\n73-74, 176, 178, 181-83; 21:195-99, 204-05. The adjuster did not properly inspect,\n\nscope the loss, and write his own estimates. Id. The adjuster instead had the City\n\ncomplete repairs and submit receipts, after which the adjuster purported to\n\ndetermine whether the repair was covered under the policy. RR11:69-71, 93;\n\n13:88, 91-92, 140-41, 142-42; 16:176.\n\n          TWIA’s adjuster did not need to wait on repair receipts to properly adjust\n\nLeague City’s losses. RR11:61, 66; 13:143-44; 16:69-71; 21:203-05. The adjuster\n\ncould have gone to the damaged sites and within days or weeks completed his own\n\nestimates, before the City had undertaken any repairs. RR13:143-44. The adjuster\n\nshould have inspected the damaged properties, determined what was and was not\n\ndamaged, written estimates, applied appropriate depreciation, and made\n\nrecommendations. RR16:68-69. He was capable of writing estimates; that was his\n\njob. RR16:70-71.\n\n\n47367_1                                 2\n\f          The adjuster’s handling of League City’s claim was inappropriate,\n\nunreasonable, and unacceptable. RR11:67, 81, 84, 88, 91-95; 16:55, 58, 60, 64-65,\n\n69-70, 74; 21:195-200, 203-04. It put the City in the position of having to make\n\nrepairs without knowing what and how much TWIA would cover. RR14:98-99;\n\n16:85-86; 12:119. It also resulted in “[t]oo much delay.” RR11:70. As the claim\n\nsupervisor acknowledged, “[I]f you wait until an expense is incurred, obviously\n\nyou didn’t write the estimate and it’s going to take ever how long it takes. And our\n\njob is to be fair and try to put the money based on the [adjuster’s] appraisal in the\n\ninsured’s hand.” RR11:71.\n\n          TWIA’s failure to properly adjust the claim meant that League City received\n\nno payment on any part of its claim for nine months. RR16:129-30; 29:472, 509-\n\n10. Only in June 2009 did League City receive an “[a]dvance against repairs” for\n\nCity Hall, but it was paid nothing on any other structure—even though TWIA had\n\nnotice of damage, received receipts, and determined coverage months earlier.\n\nRR29:509-10; 12:139-40; 13:18, 125-26; 16:78-81, 114-16, 129-30. In August\n\n2009—eleven months after Ike—TWIA finally issued a check for $304,747.40\n\nrepresenting payments on five identified items: Gazebo, City Hall, Community\n\nCenter, Museum Storage Bldg., and Fire Station 2. RR29:498-99, 514-15. TWIA\n\nacknowledged covered losses to four other items—Library, Council Chambers,\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 3\n\fCouncil Chambers CTS, and Civic Center—but made no payment because it\n\ndetermined the damages did not exceed the deductibles. Id.\n\n          Beyond delay, TWIA’s failure to properly adjust the claim meant that\n\nLeague City was not properly compensated for its windstorm losses. RR16:71, 73;\n\n12:136-37; 13:13-15, 135-36, 137-38, 140-44. TWIA’s adjuster admitted the City\n\nwas not paid for all the damages he personally documented and thought were\n\ncovered by the policy, because he waited on repair receipts instead of adjusting the\n\nloss and preparing his own estimates. RR13:135-36, 140-44, 205-07.\n\n          TWIA was critical of its “‘adjuster’” internally, recognizing he had provided\n\n“[v]ery poor service.”        RR29:486; accord RR11:81-83, 86-88, 91 (internal\n\nconversations “about the poor quality of work”). But TWIA did not share its\n\nconcerns and criticisms with League City. Id.; RR11:91; 12:44. Instead, ten\n\nmonths after Ike, TWIA told the adjuster to close the file within two weeks or the\n\nfile would be taken from him. RR29:490; 13:122; 11:87-88. Had the file been\n\ntaken away, the adjuster would have been paid nothing. RR8:41; 11:87-88.\n\n          The adjuster responded that his “efforts to this point were to protect TWIA\n\nfrom any excessive claim,” and he informed his supervisors he would make an\n\noffer to League City “based on the limited amount of data” he had in his file.\n\nRR29:492. Despite knowing the adjuster had provided poor service, had not\n\nproperly adjusted the claim, and had limited information, TWIA paid League City\n\n\n47367_1                                  4\n\fon the adjuster’s submissions, never informed League City of its concerns with and\n\ncriticisms of the adjuster’s work, and never assigned another adjuster. RR16:137,\n\n150, 160, 193-94.\n\n          League City sued TWIA in January 2012. CR7. TWIA answered the\n\nlawsuit and later demanded an appraisal. CR31; RR52:781-82. But once the\n\nappraisal award was issued, TWIA refused to pay it. CR58, 182; RR52:747.\n\n          At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found that TWIA failed to comply\n\nwith the insurance policy, violated the Insurance Code, and breached its duty of\n\ngood faith and fair dealing, and awarded damages. CR286-325. The jury also\n\nfound that the appraisal award failed to comply with policy terms and conditions.\n\nId. Although the trial court refused to ask whether TWIA’s policy breach was\n\nexcused, the jury found that League City failed to provide notice and repair\n\nreceipts. Id. But the jury did not find that League City’s failures occurred prior to\n\nTWIA’s breach. Id. Without disclosing its reasoning, the trial court disregarded\n\nthe jury’s findings in favor of League City and rendered judgment that League City\n\ntake nothing.

Even if the appraisal award\n\nfailed to comply with the policy terms and conditions, however, a new trial should\n\nbe granted, so that a new appraisal can be conducted or the parties can agree to\n\nforego the policy’s appraisal requirement.\n\n          TWIA’s alleged defenses do not support rendition of judgment in its favor.\n\nTWIA did not obtain a jury finding on excuse; TWIA did not conclusively\n\nestablish that the City’s alleged breach occurred first; and TWIA elected to treat\n\nthe contract as continuing.\n\n          If a new trial is not granted, League City is entitled to rendition of judgment\n\nin its favor. Disregarding the jury findings that are favorable to League City was\n\nerror; they are neither immaterial nor supported by legally insufficient evidence.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   6\n\f                                      ARGUMENT\n\nI.        The Trial Court Erred in Rendering Judgment for TWIA Based\n          on the Jury’s Finding that the Appraisal Award Failed to Comply\n          With Policy Terms and Conditions.\n          In asking the trial court to render judgment in its favor, TWIA argued the\n\njury’s finding that the appraisal award failed to comply with policy terms and\n\nconditions defeated League City’s ability to recover on any of its claims. CR353.\n\nBecause the trial court erred in submitting the appraisal question, however, a new\n\ntrial is required. Moreover, the failure of the appraisal award should result in a\n\nnew trial, not rendition against League City.\n\n          A.

The provision does not require that an appraiser or\n\numpire be qualified “to make complex liability determinations under an insurance\n\npolicy. There is no requirement that they be licensed.” Id. at 890 n. 23 (quoting\n\nBr. of TWIA as Amicus Curiae at 8). There is no requirement that the appraisers\n\nor umpire be insurance experts or forensic engineers “qualified to make policy\n\ninterpretations or to determine cause and origin of the damage being claimed.” Id.\n\nThe appraisers are directed to determine the amount of loss, not to apply all policy\n\nterms and conditions or determine coverage. Id. “There is no explicit requirement\n\nthat the appraisers and umpire inspect the property or read the policy, and many do\n\nnot.” Id.\n\n          If the two appraisers fail to agree, they submit their differences to an\n\n“umpire”—who is often a lawyer or mediator “with no particular experience or\n\nexpertise in property insurance coverage or claims.” Id.

In opening argument, TWIA’s counsel asked: “Why is Texas Windstorm\n\nhere?” RR7:85. He answered: “Two principal reasons. [First,] [t]he appraisal\n\naward is absolutely not, absolutely not in substantial compliance with policy terms\n\nand conditions.” Id.\n\n          After insisting that “[p]rior payments and applicable deductibles are easy to\n\nfigure out by looking at the policy,” TWIA’s counsel criticized the umpire and\n\nLeague City’s appraiser for not reading the policy: “Neither of the two gentlemen\n\nwhose numbers make up the appraisal ever had possession of the TWIA insurance\n\npolicy. Never read the TWIA insurance policy.” RR7:86. He argued that “the\n\nappraisal based on policy language should have involved only the buildings that\n\nwere called to TWIA’s attention during the adjustment period.” RR7:95. He\n\ncontinued: “Policy terms and conditions. To this very day . . . the receipts for the\n\nrepairs that League City did . . . those receipts have never to this day been\n\nproduced or given to TWIA or the appraisers . . . .” RR7:95-96.\n\n          Having highlighted the evidence in opening argument, TWIA introduced the\n\numpire’s testimony that he had never seen the insurance policy and had not read it;\n\nthat he did not know what the policy covered; that he did not “get involved into\n\n\n47367_1                                  12\n\fwhether these numbers are applicable under the policy;” that he did not determine\n\nwhether exclusions applied, for example whether “different items involved\n\nincreased cost of construction;” and that he did not get receipts. RR21:124-28.\n\n          TWIA also elicited testimony from its corporate representative that the\n\nappraisal award did not “rule out other sources for the leaks.” RR9:39. “It doesn’t\n\ngo into any causes at all.” RR9:40. TWIA’s corporate representative criticized the\n\nappraisers for not obtaining receipts and maintenance records, RR9:38, and for not\n\nattaching “documentation as to the cost or reason for replacing the roofs on the\n\nlibrary, civic center or City Hall.” RR9:43-44; accord RR8:217. He criticized the\n\naward because “it’s impossible for us to tell if some of those items are not covered\n\nunder the policy, if some of the damage noted here was from another peril besides\n\nwind and hail, or in this case the actual cash value, did it include sales tax? Did it\n\ninclude over[head and] profit? We can’t tell any of those things that are all policy\n\nterms and conditions from a lump sum number like that.” RR10:44-45.\n\n          In closing argument, TWIA emphasized the erroneous jury instruction and\n\nberated the umpire for not reading the policy and not applying its terms and\n\nconditions: “Now, how in the world can a man say that he is applying the terms\n\nand conditions of the policy or that his appraisal meets those terms and conditions\n\nwhen he doesn’t have the document? . . . He didn’t even have it. It’s not that he\n\nsaid, ‘Well, I looked at it a little bit, scanned it, flipped through it.’ Nothing. Did\n\n\n47367_1                               13\n\fnot have the document on which he has to base his award.”                RR22:142-43.\n\nTWIA’s lawyer continued: “I don’t want to belabor Mr. Burgess’ testimony, but\n\n22, ‘Does the appraisal award fail to substantially comply with the policy terms\n\nand conditions?’ You’ve got a definition for substantial compliance means a good\n\nfaith effort by the appraiser’s umpire to follow and define the terms and conditions\n\nof the policy to the covered loss. And we covered this when we were talking about\n\nNo. 2. But just so we don’t forget it, Mr. Burgess in his testimony never had the\n\npolicy. Doesn’t apply the policy terms and conditions. Didn’t even look at the\n\npolicy when he came up with his appraisal numbers. So, how in the world can the\n\naward meet the policy terms and conditions if you don’t have the policy, if you\n\ndon’t know what it says? It doesn’t.” RR22:156.\n\n          The validity of the appraisal award was a hotly contested, critical issue. “To\n\nask the jury to resolve this dispute without a proper legal definition to the essential\n\nlegal issue was reversible error.” Sw.

The jury reached\n\nan improper verdict premised on an improper submission which led to the\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                  14\n\frendition of an improper judgment.

Wells, 919 S.W.2d at 686-87. The court concluded:\n\n“The Wellses are not required to again participate involuntarily in yet another\n\nappraisal . . . when they have suffered a defective appraisal process through no\n\nfault of their own.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n          Equally in the case, if the appraisal award is disregarded, the result should be\n\na new trial, not rendition of judgment against League City. Id.

See TEX. R. CIV. P. 320 (“[A] separate trial on unliquidated damages\n\nalone shall not be ordered if liability issues are contested.”).\n\nII.       If a New Trial Is Not Granted, League City Is Entitled to\n          Rendition of Judgment on Its Breach of Contract Claim.\n          A new trial should be granted on all issues. If a new trial is not granted\n\nhowever, League City is entitled to rendition of judgment based on the jury’s\n\nfavorable findings on its breach of contract claim.\n\n          A.    The jury’s finding that TWIA failed to comply with the\n                insurance policy is supported by at least some evidence.\n          In response to question 1, the jury found that TWIA failed to comply with\n\nthe insurance policy. CR289. TWIA never challenged the jury’s breach finding as\n\nsupported by no evidence. See CR350-82. The finding is amply supported.\n\n          TWIA’s corporate representative testified that TWIA would breach the\n\ninsurance policy if it did not properly investigate a claim, if it failed to pay what is\n\nowed under the policy, or if it failed to timely pay what is owed. RR10:213. A\n\nreasonable investigation requires that an adjuster obtain enough information to\n\nwrite an accurate estimate. RR8:28. “The adjuster is expected to personally\n\ninspect and scope the loss.” RR30:297. “A scope is what the adjuster compiles\n\n\n47367_1                                 19\n\fduring his inspection. It’s all the information that he gets; dimensions, the type of\n\nbuilding materials, where the damage is, where the damage isn’t…. Without a\n\nscope, you can’t write an estimate.” RR16:64-65.\n\n          TWIA’s adjuster did not properly inspect, scope the loss, and write\n\nestimates. RR11:59-72; 13:91-92; 14:162-63; 16:60, 64-65, 68, 73-74, 176, 178,\n\n181-83; 21:195-99. TWIA could not just wait on repair receipts as an excuse or\n\nsubstitute for properly investigating and adjusting League City’s claim. RR11:70-\n\n72, 93; 16:68-71, 138-40, 144; 21:198-99. The failure of the adjustment process\n\nmeant the City did not get paid what it was owed under the policy and did not get\n\npaid in a timely manner. RR13:14-15, 18-19, 27, 29-30; 16:70-71, 73-74, 129-30,\n\n136, 140, 149; 21:202, 204, 196-97; 10:186-87.\n\n          B.    There is at least some evidence of League City’s damages.\n          Question 3 asked, “What amount of the appraisal damage award is for\n\ndamage caused by windstorm?” CR293. As TWIA recognized, question 3 is a\n\n“damage” question that allowed the jury to find the amount of League City’s\n\nwindstorm damages without regard to the appraisal award. RR22:36-37.\n\n          League City objected to question 3 on the ground that it had no burden to\n\nprove the dollar amount of the damage caused by Hurricane Ike.             RR22:11.\n\nLeague City’s only burden was to prove that TWIA failed to pay for covered losses\n\nunder the policy. Id. Under the terms of the policy, the appraisal award sets the\n\n\n47367_1                                20\n\famount of loss. Id. Because the jury charge improperly shifted the burden of\n\nproving the amount of loss to League City contrary to the terms of the appraisal\n\nprovision, League City should be granted a new trial so that the appraisal provision\n\ncan be enforced or the parties can agree to waive the appraisal provision. See\n\nsection I.B. above; see also Willis, 199 S.W.3d at 275-76 (erroneous charge on\n\nmeasure of damages required remand).\n\n          In any event, TWIA’s adjuster admitted that League City was never paid for\n\na “good amount” of the damages that he personally documented and determined\n\n“were caused by Ike and covered by the policy[.]” RR13:140-44.\n\n          Tony Meyer, League City’s facilities maintenance supervisor, inspected\n\nmany of League City’s facilities immediately after the storm, and he explained the\n\nhurricane damage he saw on a structure-by-structure basis. See, e.g., RR14:102-07\n\n(library), 107-09 (park gazebo), 120-24 (city hall), 128-32 (civic center), 132-35\n\n(community center), 141-43 (fire station 1), 146-47 (vehicle maintenance), 157-59,\n\n161 (fire station 2), 15:52-54 (library), 54-55 (council chambers), 55-57\n\n(community center), 60 (vehicle maintenance), 65 (fire station 1), 71-72 (fire\n\nstation 2), 75-76 (museum storage). The jury also heard from the City’s forensic\n\nengineering expert, who inspected the structures, spoke with witnesses, and offered\n\nhis opinions on the specific damage caused by windstorm. See RR17:6-8, 18-20,\n\n36, 37-77 (library); 78-88 (council chambers); 88-94 (city hall); 94-112 (civic\n\n\n47367_1                                21\n\fcenter); 112-20 (community center); 18:13-15 (library), 15-16, 18 (council\n\nchambers), 18-23 (city hall), 24-34 (civic center), 43-45 (vehicle maintenance), 45-\n\n50 (fire station 1), 50-57 (fire station 2).\n\n          As for the dollar value of the damage, TWIA’s corporate representative\n\nexplained that he had analyzed the appraisers’ estimates, all available photographs,\n\nthe engineering reports and the policy, and created his own “adjusted award” for\n\neach policy item. RR8:109, 114-16; 10:138-39; 27:256-63. His analysis had\n\n“nothing to do with” the appraisal award. RR10:139-40. Instead, his adjusted\n\naward was based on the damage he could document four or five years after the\n\nloss. RR7:166; 8:112-13, 115-16. And his adjusted award applied the insurance\n\npolicy terms and conditions, including exclusions. Id. His spreadsheet supplied\n\nthe jury with his estimate of the City’s Hurricane Ike damage, the estimates of each\n\nappraiser, and the amounts previously paid by TWIA. See RR27:262-63.\n\n          The corporate representative’s testimony and spreadsheet provide some\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s answers to question 3 and preclude rendition of\n\njudgment against League City. But the jury also had the detailed estimates of both\n\nappraisers, multiple repair bids for City Hall, the City’s records documenting\n\nHurricane Ike expenses, and the adjuster’s spreadsheets identifying Hurricane Ike\n\ndamage. See RR21:20; 29:355-430; 31:373-79; 32:52-70; 33:114-24; 34:178-91,\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                  22\n\f237-46, 390-95; 35:105-17, 366-74; 36:52-58, 266-71, 363-81; 37:163-66, 173-98;\n\n38:67-70, 143-54; 44:373-86, 523-29, 561-77; 46:343-496, 695-734; 52:1402-07.\n\n          TWIA’s corporate representative testified that the jury could reach its own\n\nconclusions about the amount of the City’s covered losses, just as he had, by\n\nexamining the two appraisers’ estimates, the policy, the photographs, “and\n\neverything else.” RR8:116. That is what the jury did.\n\n          The jury’s damage awards are supported by the evidence, and the trial court\n\nerred in disregarding them. Even if there were not legally sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the entire amount of damages, the result should be a new trial, not\n\nrendition. See Guevara v. Ferrer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894899\"><a href=\"/opinion/894899/guevara-v-ferrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670 (Tex. 2007) (“[W]hen\n\nthere is evidence to support some damages it is not appropriate to render\n\njudgment.”).\n\n          C.

Nonetheless, that disclosure does\n\nnot identify “the Appraisal Award as its [exclusive] method for calculating its\n\ndamages.” Cf. CR366. To the contrary, the City disclosed that it had “not been\n\nproperly compensated under the terms of its insurance policy,” had “not been paid\n\nin full for the damages to its Properties,” and was “entitled to regain the benefit of\n\nits bargain.” CR211-14.\n\n          Moreover, Strickland’s testimony explaining his analysis of the appraisers’\n\nestimates and Strickland’s spreadsheet (identifying the amount of each appraiser’s\n\nestimate and Strickland’s “adjusted award” for each structure) were admitted\n\nwithout objection.

The chapter is to be “liberally construed and applied” to promote its\n\npurposes. TEX. INS.

This is a “very important” part of the adjuster’s job, RR16:112, and\n\nthe City needed to know whether the claim would be accepted or denied.\n\nRR16:84.

RR21:146, 202.\n\nThe adjuster, not League City, was supposed to inspect, identify damages,\n\ndetermine coverage, and write estimates.         RR21:204-06.    Another TWIA\n\nsupervisor agreed. RR11:63-67, 69-72, 93.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               27\n\f          It was not appropriate to wait for the insured to make repairs and then\n\ndetermine whether a repair receipt was covered under the policy. RR11:70-72, 88,\n\n93; 16:69-70. That process resulted in “[t]oo much delay.” RR 11:70. The\n\nadjuster should have been able to determine coverage at the time of his inspection,\n\nRR16:110, and did not need to wait for receipts. RR13:143-44; 16:87-88, 108-10.\n\nThe adjuster’s duty was to adjust the claim and prepare estimates of the City’s\n\ncovered losses without waiting for receipts.       RR13:143-44; 16:87-88, 108-10.\n\nThus, reimbursing the City for receipts did not excuse TWIA’s failure to properly\n\ndetermine coverage for the City’s losses in the first instance. RR16:138. The\n\nadjuster did not need receipts from the City to adjust and estimate the claim.\n\nRR11:68, 70, 74; 16:74, 115, 147.\n\n          All of this evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s finding that TWIA\n\nfailed to affirm or deny coverage in a reasonable time.\n\n          B.    League City’s Insurance Code claims are independent of its\n                breach of contract theory.\n          Instead of challenging the evidence supporting the jury’s findings that it\n\nviolated the Insurance Code, TWIA argued that rejection of League City’s contract\n\nclaim defeats recovery under chapter 541. CR367. That is incorrect, and it is also\n\ninconsistent with TWIA’s claim that the jury’s breach-of-contract finding was\n\nimmaterial. Because a policy claim is independent of a bad-faith claim, League\n\nCity did not need to prove that TWIA breached the insurance policy to recover\n\n47367_1                                28\n\funder the Insurance Code. But League City did obtain a finding that TWIA\n\nbreached the policy. CR289.\n\n               1.    League City does not need a finding that TWIA failed\n                     to comply with the policy to recover under the\n                     Insurance Code.\n          TWIA argued below that “rejection of League City’s breach of contract\n\nclaim defeats recovery under Chapter 541.” CR367.

TWIA’s argument should be rejected.\n\n          First,   TWIA’s   argument    renders   meaningless     section   2210.552’s\n\nauthorization of a suit against TWIA under chapter 541. Such a construction\n\nviolates canons of statutory construction. See Helena Chem. Co. v. Wilkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749669\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749669/helena-chemical-co-v-wilkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">486</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 493 (Tex. 2001) (“We should not give one provision a meaning out of\n\nharmony or inconsistent with other provisions, although it might be susceptible to\n\nsuch a construction standing alone. We must presume that the Legislature intends\n\nan entire statute to be effective and that a just and reasonable result is intended.”).\n\n          Second, when the Legislature intends to immunize TWIA from liability, the\n\nLegislature does so plainly. See, e.g., TEX. INS. CODE §§ 2210.007 (stating TWIA\n\n“is not liable” for certain actions), 2210.572 (stating—with respect to policies\n\nissued 60 days after its effective date of September 28, 2011—TWIA “may not be\n\nheld liable” for certain damages). The court should not interpret the Legislature’s\n\n\n47367_1                                 39\n\fcommands regarding TWIA’s “use [of] the net gain from operations” as a directive\n\nthat TWIA “is not liable” for chapter 541 claims. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical\n\nCo. v.

The Legislature’s acts are not meaningless, and TWIA\n\ncan be liable for League City’s pre-2011 Chapter 541 damage claims.\n\n          Fourth, there is no proof that TWIA lacks “capital or surplus funds.” Texas\n\nInsurance Code section 541.454(a)(1) provides that “civil penalties, premium\n\nrefunds, judgments, compensatory judgments, individual recoveries, orders, class\n\naction awards, costs, damages, or attorney’s fees assessed or awarded” under\n\nChapter 541 “may be paid only from the capital or surplus funds of the offending\n\ninsurer.” TEX. INS. CODE § 541.454(a)(1). TWIA has not provided any factual\n\nsupport or evidence for its contention that it does not maintain a surplus.\n\n          TWIA turns to Texas Insurance Code section 2210.452(c) for its argument\n\nthat “it does not have a surplus.” But here is what section 2210.452(c) states:\n\n          At the end of each calendar year or policy year, the association shall\n          use the net gain from operations of the association, including all\n\n47367_1                                 40\n\f          premium and other revenue of the association in excess of incurred\n          losses, operating expenses, public security obligations, and public\n          security administrative expenses, to make payments to the trust fund,\n          to procure reinsurance, or to make payments to the trust fund and to\n          procure reinsurance.\nTEX. INS. CODE § 2210.452(c).\n\n          Section 2210.452(c) does not even use the word “surplus.” It only addresses\n\n“net gain from operations” as the amount to be paid into the trust fund or to be paid\n\nfor reinsurance. It does not define or specify that “operations” have to exclude\n\nlosses in the form of liability as a result of poor adjustment of claims under policies\n\nissued prior to September 28, 2011. Moreover, it requires only that TWIA use any\n\nnet gain from operations for payments to the trust fund or for reinsurance at “the\n\nend of each calendar year or policy year.”              Nothing prohibits TWIA from\n\nmaintaining a “surplus” throughout the year from which it would be able to pay a\n\njury award of damages under Chapter 541.\n\n          Accordingly, the trial court could not disregard the jury’s findings that:\n\n               TWIA failed to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable\n                time;\n\n               TWIA’s failure to affirm or deny coverage within a reasonable\n                time was an unfair or deceptive act or practice; and\n\n               TWIA’s unfair or deceptive act or practice caused damages to\n                League City in the amount of $105,778.00.\nCR296-98.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                   41\n\f          E.    League City’s extra-contractual claims are not barred by\n                limitations.\n          TWIA bore the burden to plead, prove, and secure findings to sustain its\n\nlimitations defense.

As the trial\n\ncourt ruled, the September 2009 email from TWIA’s adjuster does not\n\nconclusively establish TWIA’s limitations defense. Id.; see RR29:506. The email\n\ndoes not “den[y] League City’s claims beyond the amount it had already agreed to\n\npay on September 21, 2009.”           Compare CR381 and RR29:506.          The email\n\nforwards “the current claim summary” with “the current total claim amount for\n\neach of the locations.” RR29:506 (emphasis added). It advises “that there may be\n\nsome claim issues that have not yet been submitted by your administrators, but\n\nwould be considered for coverage . . . .” Id. And it directs League City to “submit\n\nall future claim documentation through your current agent who will forward to\n\nTWIA.” Id. The adjuster’s email does not establish League City’s claim has been\n\nconcluded. RR13:69. While the email identifies certain locations for which there\n\nis “NO COV,” League City has not sought to recover damages associated with any\n\nof those locations.\n\n47367_1                                 42\n\f          Moreover, TWIA’s corporate representative was adamant that League City’s\n\nclaim remained opened after September 2009. RR7:233-34, 249; 9:62. “[T]he\n\nclaim itself is still open.” RR9:65. TWIA made a supplemental payment on May\n\n13, 2010, and the claim remained open at least through September 2010. RR9:65-\n\n71; 12:175-76; 29:528-29. The claim was perhaps closed at some point after\n\nSeptember 2010, but even then the claim was reopened when the City requested an\n\nextension, and TWIA made another supplemental payment in October 2011.\n\nRR9:75-76, 80-81; see RR29:519, 527 (explaining “final adjustment of your\n\nclaim”). League City filed suit three months later. CR7.\n\n          TWIA did not conclusively establish that League City’s claim was denied or\n\nclosed more than two years before January 17, 2012. See CR7.

See pp. 1-5 above. TWIA has never addressed the\n\nevidence supporting the jury’s finding, but instead argued that the jury’s answers to\n\nother questions in the charge prove it had a reasonable basis for failing to\n\nreasonably investigate the claim and for failing to attempt to effectuate a prompt,\n\nfair, and equitable settlement once its liability had become reasonably clear.\n\nCR372-73.

TWIA did not object to any allegedly conflicting jury findings\n\nbefore the jury was discharged, so there is no basis for TWIA’s speculation about\n\nwhat the jury intended by its other answers.

Consequently, League City’s purported failure to comply with the\n\ninsurance policy does not conclusively defeat its ability to recover. Id.

The Jury Findings on TWIA’s Alleged Defenses Do Not Support\n          Rendition of a Take Nothing Judgment.\n          In seeking a take-nothing judgment, TWIA argued that the jury findings on\n\nits alleged defenses entirely or partially excused TWIA’s performance under the\n\ninsurance policy and defeated League City’s extra-contractual claims.

The insurers did not accept the claim, investigate,\n\nmake payments, and demand appraisal under the policy. Id.

Id.\n\n          Nothing in the supreme court’s opinion in PAJ (or in any other case)\n\nsuggests a willingness to enforce the rule that a prior material breach by one\n\ncontracting party excuses performance by the opposite party, while eschewing the\n\nequivalent rule that one who elects to treat the contract as continuing deprives\n\nhimself of any excuse for ceasing his own performance.

As the record reflects, TWIA failed to request a jury\n\nquestion asking whether TWIA’s failure to comply with the insurance policy was\n\nexcused. CR289-322; cf. TEXAS PATTERN JURY CHARGES—BUS., CONSUMER, INS.\n\n& EMPLOYMENT PJC 101.21, 101.59 (2014) (identifying the “controlling question”\n\nwhen insurer raises excuse defense). League City therefore objected to the charge\n\nbecause it failed to ask the jury the controlling excuse question. RR22:13, 17.\n\n47367_1                                52\n\fLeague City also objected to questions 18 and 20 on the ground that they did not\n\ndetermine whether League City’s alleged failure to give notice or provide receipts\n\nwas a prior breach. Id. Although not its burden, League City also requested a\n\nquestion on excuse. CR333; RR22:23. The trial court overruled League City’s\n\nobjections and refused its tendered question. CR333, RR22:14, 18.\n\n          Despite TWIA’s assertion that the jury’s findings in response to questions 18\n\nthrough 21 excuse TWIA’s failure to comply with the insurance policy in whole or\n\nin part, nothing in question 18 or in question 20 (which asked whether League City\n\nfailed to provide notice and failed to provide receipts) was tied in any way to\n\nquestion 1 (which asked whether TWIA failed to comply with the insurance\n\npolicy). RR22:13, 17. Neither question 18 nor 20 identified the breach by TWIA\n\nthat League City’s failures were supposed to excuse. CR311, 316. And neither\n\nquestion required the jury to determine whether League City’s failure to provide\n\nnotice or receipts occurred prior to TWIA’s own failure to comply with the policy.\n\nId.\n\n          It is not undisputed that League City’s failure to provide notice or receipts\n\noccurred before TWIA’s failure to timely and properly investigate, adjust, estimate\n\nand pay for League City’s losses. Post-trial, TWIA argued that League City’s\n\nfailure to give notice occurred on September 15, 2008, when League City\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 53\n\fsubmitted its First Notice of Loss.              CR806-07.     But that was not the notice\n\nargument TWIA made at trial.4\n\n          At trial, TWIA’s corporate representative swore that he was not criticizing\n\nLeague City for failing to identify every potential loss location on its First Notice\n\nof Loss. RR10:189. A TWIA claims supervisor testified that League City’s First\n\nNotice of Claim was typical of the notices TWIA received, and that it was\n\nsufficient to put TWIA on notice. RR14:43-44.\n\n          TWIA’s corporate representative opined that “the duty to provide notice of a\n\nclaim” included the obligation to provide on-going information on additional\n\ndamage, hidden damage, and additional costs.                  RR8:231; 9:28-30.          And he\n\ncriticized League City because “[t]here was no contact from the City at all\n\nregarding any kind of damage, additional damage that wasn’t addressed.” RR9:37-\n\n38; see also RR9:67-68, 70. TWIA “had no indication that there were ongoing\n\nproblems with the roof [on City Hall, the municipal court, or the library]. We had\n\nno indication that they required replacement. No contact whatsoever.” RR8:216.\n\n          In questioning City employees, TWIA similarly emphasized its theory that\n\nthe City failed to provide written notice and repair receipts as the City repaired\n\nleaks in 2009. E.g., RR15:123-26, 131-33.\n\n4\n  If the City’s failure to provide notice occurred on September 15, 2008 when it provided its First\nNotice of Loss, then TWIA indisputably elected to treat the policy as continuing and cannot use\nthe City’s alleged breach as an excuse for its own non-performance. See section V.A.\n\n47367_1                                     54\n\f          TWIA also repeatedly complained that League City did not provide notice\n\nbefore filing suit in 2012. E.g., RR9:86-87, 94-97; 10:88, 90-91, 117, 136-37.\n\nAccording to TWIA, failing to give pre-suit notice “goes back to the very\n\nconditions that we talked about yesterday about providing notice of the claim,\n\ndocumenting loss, et cetera[.]” RR9:95.\n\n          TWIA emphasized its contention that League City had an ongoing duty to\n\nprovide notice and receipts in closing argument:\n\n              “Not one witness has stood up here and said, ‘Here’s a covered\n               cost that we submitted, we identified, that we brought it to\n               somebody’s attention hasn’t been paid. Not one receipt that we\n               submitted that wasn’t paid.’” RR22:94.\n\n              “Not once did they pick up the phone and say, ‘We’ve got a\n               problem.’” RR22:95.\n\n              “We don’t have a single new receipt, a single maintenance\n               record for all those repairs you saw have been made.”\n               RR22:95.\n\n              “[T]hey sued without making any notice.” RR22:95.\n\n              “The lawsuit that was filed, instead of picking up the phone or\n               sending an email or writing a letter…which is what all of you\n               guys would have done if this had been your home, your office,\n               your facility….” RR22:97.\n\n              “What we’re saying is Texas Windstorm didn’t have a chance\n               to address those damages because either, A, when they said\n               they were giving us receipts they didn’t give them or, B, when\n               the damages were found, nobody told us. And all we ask for,\n               all the policy requires is notice. And then we’ll react.\n               RR22:101.\n\n\n\n47367_1                                55\n\f               “[T]hat’s not fair to ask Texas Windstorm to pay for those.\n                They weren’t even told about them. Make them go make a\n                proper claim and then we’ll see.” RR22:103.\n\n               “If they didn’t say anything then, how fair is it to come in and\n                say it now after you filed a lawsuit, you waited over three and a\n                half years to raise your issues? And more importantly, when\n                we talk about that, is it timely? I mean, is it timely? Is that\n                prompt notice, written notice of a claim as required by an\n                insurance policy that you’ve heard about?” RR22:113.\n          While TWIA emphasized League City’s on-going failures to provide notice\n\nand receipts in the years following Ike and before suit was filed, the jury heard a\n\ngreat deal of evidence regarding TWIA’s failure to investigate and adjust the\n\nCity’s claim immediately after Ike.\n\n          A TWIA claims supervisor testified that “the purpose of sending an adjuster\n\nto the property is that they’re qualified to inspect, note the damages, figure out\n\nwhat’s covered and not covered, and generate an estimate for the cost of repairs or\n\nreplacement.”       RR21:203-04.     TWIA acknowledged that it was obligated to\n\ninvestigate anything the insured reports.         RR10:91.    Nonetheless, while the\n\nspreadsheets provided to TWIA document “obvious roof leak[s]” to various\n\nstructures, the adjuster never got on the roofs, inspected the damage, or estimated\n\nthe losses. RR12:188-90; 13:12-15, 29-30, 67; 14:157, 162-63. By August 4,\n\n2009, there was no excuse and no lack of information that kept the adjuster from\n\ncompleting the field portion of League City’s claim. RR21:202.\n\n\n\n47367_1                                 56\n\f          While it is fine for the adjuster to request information and have the City fill\n\nout spreadsheets, that does not replace the adjuster’s obligation to personally\n\ninspect and scope the loss and estimate the cost of repair. RR16:70-71, 74;\n\n21:198-99. Paying on receipts did not “excuse[] all of what had transpired over the\n\ncourse of the claim handling in the first year before [the adjuster] wrote any\n\nestimates.” RR16:138. If the adjuster had prepared estimates when he initially\n\nwent out to the League City structures, the lawsuit likely would never have\n\noccurred. RR16:136; 15:191-92; 14:162-63.\n\n          There is conflicting testimony about the timing of TWIA’s and League\n\nCity’s alleged failures to comply with the policy. Yet TWIA refused to ask the\n\njury whether TWIA’s failure to comply was excused, or whether League City’s\n\nalleged failures to comply occurred prior to TWIA’s failure to comply. CR286-\n\n324, 333; RR22:12-14, 16-18. In light of the evidence, the trial court could not\n\ndeem a finding on these contested issues in TWIA’s favor. TEX. R. CIV.

League City complied with the policy’s notice requirement\n               as a matter of law, or TWIA waived the notice requirement\n               as a matter of law.\n          Following Ike, League City provided written notice on TWIA’s “First\n\nNotice of Loss-Claims Reporting Form” on September 15, 2008, two days after the\n\nstorm. See RR27:211. The City’s written notice identifies the insured, policy\n\nnumber, policy period, and date of loss, and it describes the losses as “Wind\n\nDamage to Various Locations.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n47367_1                               58\n\f          League City’s notice satisfied the policy requirement as a matter of law—as\n\nTWIA determined at the time League City’s performance under the policy was\n\nrequired. RR14:43-44; 11:61-63; 16:151; 10:188-90. TWIA voiced no complaint\n\nor criticism about the notice. RR16:151; 14:43-44; 10:188-89. TWIA accepted\n\nand acknowledged League City’s notice with its “Claim Notice Acknowledgment\n\nand Assignment,” in which it described the City’s loss as “Hurricane Ike Damage”\n\nand listed all 140 items covered under the policy. RR10:185, 189-90; 27:212.\n\nTWIA opened a claim with a single claim number, assigned an adjuster, assigned a\n\nsupervisor, and set an initial loss reserve. RR10:189-90; 11:61-63; 14:43-44;\n\n27:212; 52:174. Ultimately, TWIA “received and accepted” the adjuster’s reports\n\nand acknowledged covered damage to the Library, Gazebo, City Hall, Council\n\nChambers, Council Chambers CTS, Civic Center, Community Center, Museum\n\nStorage Bldg., and Fire Station 2. RR29:498.\n\n          In closing, TWIA did not dispute that it received proper notice regarding\n\nthese items:\n\n          I think the evidence shows there are eight items on the appraisal\n          award where they did give proper notice. And there’s a couple of\n          pages and you will see it when you go through. But it’s a library, the\n          park gazebo, it’s the ones that you see in Exhibit 16.

Mr. Cashiola established that the reasonable and necessary\n\nfee for an appeal to the court of appeals was $50,000. RR19:211-12. Mr. Cashiola\n\nfurther established that the reasonable and necessary fee for an appeal to the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas was $35,000. RR19:215.

You may discuss the case with other jurors only\nwhen you are all together in the jury room.\n       Remember my previous instructions: Do not discuss-the-case-with anyone else,-either in —\nperson or by any other means. Do not do any independent investigation about the case or conduct\nany research. Do not look up any words in dictionaries or on the Internet. Do not post\ninformation about the case on the Internet. Do not share any special knowledge or experiences\nwith the other jurors. Do not use your phone or any other electronic device during your\ndeliberations for any reason. I will give you a number where others may contact you in case of\nan emergency.\n        Any notes you have taken are for your own personal use. You may take your notes back\ninto the jury room and consult them during deliberations; but do not show or read your notes to\nyour fellow jurors during your deliberations. Your notes are not evidence. Each of you should\nrely on your independent recollection of the evidence and not be influenced by the fact that\nanother juror has or has not taken notes.\n\n        You must leave your notes with the bailiff when you are not deliberating. The bailiff will\ngive your notes to me promptly after collecting them from you. I will make sure your notes are\nkept in a safe, secure location and not disclosed to anyone. After you complete your\ndeliberations, the bailiff will collect your notes. When you are released from jury duty, the bailiff\nwill promptly destroy your notes so that nobody can read what you wrote.\n\fHere are the instructions for answering the questions.\n          Do not let-bias T-prejudiee, or-sympathy play any part in your decision.\n\n   2.     Base your answers only on the evidence admitted in court and on the law that is in\n          these instructions and questions. Do not consider or discuss any evidence that was\n          not admitted in the courtroom.\n    3.    You are to make up your own minds about the facts. You are the sole judges of the\n          credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. But on matters\n          of law, you must follow all of my instructions.\n\n   4.     If my instructions use a word in a way that is different from its ordinary meaning,\n          use the meaning I give you, which will be a proper legal definition.\n\n    57- All the questions and answers are important. No one should say that any question\n         or answer is not important.\n\n    6.    Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all questions unless you are told otherwise. A \"yes\"\n          answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are told\n          otherwise. Whenever a question requires an answer other than \"yes\" or \"no,\" your\n          answer must be based on a preponderance of the evidence- unless-you are told\n          otherwise\n    7.    The term \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of credible\n          evidence presented in this case. If you do not find that a preponderance of the\n          evidence supports a \"yes\" answer, then answer \"no.\" A preponderance of the\n          evidence is not measured by tbe number_ofitnesses__or by the number of\n          documents admitted in evidence. For ...a fact to be proved by a preponderance of the\n          evidence, you must find that the fact is more likely true than not true.\n\n    8.    A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both.\n          A fact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or\n          by witnesses who saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established\n             eircumstantig-evidence When it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from\n          other facts proved.\n    9.    Do not decide who you think should win before you answer the questions and then\n          just answer the questions to match your decision. Answer each question carefully\n          without considering who will win. Do not discuss or consider the effect your\n          answers will have.\n\n    10.    Do not answer questions by drawing straws or by any method of chance.\n    11.    Some questions might ask you for a dollar amount. Do not agree in advance to\n           decide on a dollar amount by adding up each juror's amount and then figuring the\n           average.\n\n\n                                                                                                 287\n\f       12.    Do not trade your answers. For example, do not say, \"I will answer this question\n              your way if you answer another question my way.\"\n\n       13.    Unless otherwise instructed, the answers to the questions must be based on the\n              decision of at least 10 of the 12 jurors. The same 10 jurors must agree on every\n              answer. Do not agree to be bound by a vote of anything less than 10 jurors, even if\n              it would be a majority.\n     As_Lhave said before,_if yo_u do_nat_follow theseinstructions, you will be guilty_o_fjuror\nmisconduct, and I might have to order a new trial and start this process over again. This would\nwaste your time and the parties' money, and would require the taxpayers of this county to pay for\nanother trial.
