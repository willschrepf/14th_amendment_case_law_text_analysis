EIG & ASSOCIATES, PC, Chevy\nChase, Maryland, for Appellants.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n      In January 2006, following the refusal of the Montgomery\n\nCounty Board of Education to authorize the placement of their\n\nthen minor child, E.S., into a residential school based on her\n\ndisabilities,       appellants       Richard      Shaw       and     Carol         Shoemaker\n\n(together with E.S., the “Shaws”), unilaterally enrolled E.S. in\n\na residential treatment facility in Massachusetts.                                 They then\n\nfiled   an     action      under     the       Individuals         with    Disabilities\n\nEducation Act (the “IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., against\n\nJerry   Weast,      Superintendent     of       the    Montgomery         County      Public\n\nSchools,      and    the     Montgomery         County       Board        of       Education\n\n(collectively referred to as “MCPS”), seeking reimbursement for\n\nthe cost of that facility, claiming that MCPS violated the IDEA\n\nby denying E.S. a free appropriate public education.                               The Shaws\n\nappeal the district court’s order granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of MCPS.       For the reasons below, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                           I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n     Pursuant to the IDEA, a child with disabilities is entitled\n\nto a “free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) designed by\n\nthe child’s school district to meet his or her particular needs.\n\n20   U.S.C.    §    1400(d)(1)(A).          The       FAPE   must     be       “reasonably\n\ncalculated     to   confer    some    educational        benefit      on       a    disabled\n\n                                           2\n\fchild.”       MM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 303 F.3d 523,\n\n526 (4th Cir. 2002) (citing Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, 458 U.S.\n\n176,    207    (1982)).        The    FAPE       must    also    provide        the    least\n\nrestrictive environment that is appropriate for the child.                                  20\n\nU.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A).               The IDEA does not require a school\n\ndistrict to provide a child with the best possible education.\n\nRowley,    458   U.S.     at   192.     In       other    words,     though      a    school\n\ndistrict      must   offer     each   student      a     FAPE,   the     IDEA    does      not\n\nrequire the “furnishing of every special service necessary to\n\nmaximize      each   handicapped       child’s         potential.”         Hartmann        v.\n\nLoudoun County Bd. of Educ., 118 F.3d 996, 1001 (4th Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 199-200).\n\n       The IDEA requires that an “IEP Team,” consisting of the\n\nstudent’s      parents,      the   student’s       teacher,      a     school     district\n\nrepresentative, and, where appropriate, the student, develop an\n\nIndividualized       Educational       Program         (“IEP”)     for    the    student,\n\nsetting forth details on the implementation of the student’s\n\nFAPE.     20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B).                The IEP contains statements\n\nabout   the    child’s     functioning       levels,       goals,      services       to    be\n\nprovided, and criteria for future evaluations of the child’s\n\nprogress.      Id. at § 1414(d)(1)(A).              It is against this backdrop\n\nthat the Shaws claim that the IEP that MCPS developed failed to\n\nprovide E.S. with a FAPE.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                          B.\n\n     E.S. was born in the Philippines in 1985, and was severely\n\nmalnourished as a young child.             She came to live in an orphanage\n\nthere and, at the age of four, was adopted by Richard Shaw and\n\nCarol Shoemaker who brought E.S. to live in Maryland.\n\n     E.S. has struggled with severe disabilities throughout her\n\nacademic      life,      including       emotional         disturbance,        hearing\n\nimpairment,        speech     and     language     impairment,       and      learning\n\ndisabilities.          E.S.    has     also     been   diagnosed     with      bipolar\n\ndisorder,     clinical        depression,        and     post    traumatic      stress\n\ndisorder, stemming from an alleged unwanted sexual encounter.\n\n     In the middle of seventh grade, E.S. experienced increased\n\nsocial and emotional issues, including suicidal tendencies and\n\nclinical depression.          E.S.’s IEP Team determined that the least\n\nrestrictive environment for E.S. was a full-time, non-public,\n\nspecial education day school.             Accordingly, at the start of her\n\neighth     grade     year,     E.S.     began     at     the    Foundation      School\n\n(“Foundation”), a private special education day school.\n\n     During her first few years at Foundation, E.S. was able to\n\ncomplete over twenty credits.             During the 2003-2004 school year,\n\nhowever,    E.S.      began    to    struggle     with    a     number   of    issues,\n\nincluding depression and loss, and was hospitalized for a period\n\nof time during the school year for suicidal ideations.                        On April\n\n30, 2004, E.S.’s IEP Team met to develop an IEP for the 2004-\n\n                                          4\n\f2005 academic year, taking into account E.S.’s recent problems.\n\nThe    IEP      Team   identified       a    number     of     objectives          for    E.S.     to\n\naddress her audiological, emotional, academic, and other needs,\n\nand the IEP Team agreed that the least restrictive environment\n\nwhere      E.S.’s      IEP   could     be    implemented        remained       at    a        private\n\nseparate day school.                 Accordingly, they determined that E.S.\n\nwould continue at Foundation for the 2004-2005 academic year.\n\n       E.S.’s condition deteriorated during the 2004-2005 school\n\nyear.        During an especially troubling incident in mid-October,\n\nE.S. became agitated and began to engage in self-mutilating acts\n\nwhile at school and had to be physically restrained.                                            As a\n\nresult       of   that       incident,       a   functional           behavior       assessment\n\n(“FBA”) was conducted.                 The FBA results showed that E.S. had\n\nbecome        “increasingly          oppositional             with        staff”     and        more\n\ndisrespectful,          and    that     she      continued           to    engage        in     self-\n\nmutilation at school.                JA 1099.          The FBA also indicated that\n\nE.S. “had difficulty remaining physically safe in situations at\n\nschool and at home.”             Id.        On November 5, 2004, E.S.’s IEP Team\n\nmet to address the issues identified in the FBA and developed a\n\nplan       to     address       some        of       E.S.’s     behavioral           problems. 1\n\nNotwithstanding the implementation of the plan, by December of\n\n       1\n       The plan also addressed E.S.’s hearing issues, but E.S.\ndid not consistently use the resources provided to her, nor did\nshe consistently wear hearing aids or replace the batteries in\nher hearing aids while at Foundation.\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fthat year, E.S.’s interim progress report showed that she was in\n\ndanger of failing four classes, two of which were graduation\n\nrequirements.\n\n         In April 2005, E.S. was hospitalized.                     She was released\n\nfrom the hospital on April 30, 2005, but did not return to\n\nFoundation for the remainder of the school year.                                After her\n\nApril hospitalization, E.S.’s IEP Team met a number of times to\n\ndetermine     the    proper         placement     for    E.S.    for     the    2005-2006\n\nacademic year.         During one of those meetings, E.S. expressed a\n\ndesire not to return to Foundation.                     By September 2005, E.S.’s\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. Michal Potash, recommended that E.S. be placed\n\nin   a    twenty-four        hour    care     facility.         E.S.’s       parents    also\n\nsubmitted     a     recommendation           by   Dr.   William        Stixrud,    Ph.D.,\n\nanother psychologist, stating that E.S. might be able to benefit\n\nfrom placement in a residential facility.\n\n         On September 13, 2005, E.S.’s IEP Team again convened to\n\ndiscuss      whether        E.S.    required      placement       at     a     residential\n\nfacility or whether a private separate day school would satisfy\n\nthe IDEA.      The MCPS staff contended at that meeting that E.S.\n\ncould     continue     at    a     private    separate    day     school,       since    her\n\nissues      were     mainly         mental-health       related,         improvable      by\n\nmedication.        The IEP Team agreed at that meeting that Foundation\n\nwould continue as E.S.’s interim placement.                       Shortly after this\n\nmeeting, an MCPS School Psychologist, Marcia Gustafson, M.Ed.,\n\n                                              6\n\fconducted a review of Dr. Stixrud’s assessment of E.S.                              Based on\n\nher review, Dr. Gustafson concluded that E.S. should be placed\n\nin    a   therapeutic        school       setting       for    students      with    serious\n\nemotional issues.            Dr. Gustafson also concluded, however, that a\n\nresidential      placement          was    not        necessary      to   further      E.S.’s\n\neducation, though it might be necessary to address E.S.’s mental\n\nhealth issues.\n\n      On October 17, 2005, E.S.’s IEP Team met once again to\n\nreview E.S.’s IEP and placement.                      The Team revised E.S.’s IEP to\n\ninclude a number of new accommodations and objectives.                              None of\n\nthese goals and objectives required implementation beyond the\n\nschool    day   and    the     MCPS       IEP    team    members     determined        that   a\n\nprivate     separate     day    school          was    still   the    least     restrictive\n\nenvironment      where       E.S.     could      receive       a   FAPE.        During    the\n\nmeeting, the IEP Team also discussed the Shaws’ request for a\n\nresidential placement for E.S.                   While the MCPS team members did\n\nnot    agree    that     a    residential            placement     was     necessary,     all\n\nparties agreed that there would be a change in E.S.’s school\n\nplacement, to address E.S.’s request that she no longer attend\n\nFoundation.      MCPS identified three alternative private separate\n\nday   schools    for    E.S.:       the    Lodge       School,     Oakmont      School,   and\n\nPathways School.\n\n      On October 19, 2005, MCPS personnel corresponded with the\n\nthree     potential    schools        regarding         whether      or   not   they     could\n\n                                                 7\n\fimplement E.S.’s IEP.              On October 20, 2005, E.S. returned to\n\nFoundation.       Approximately a week later, the Pathways School and\n\nLodge School informed the Shaws that they could not implement\n\nE.S.’s IEP.          During the first week of November, Oakmont School\n\ninformed the Shaws that it could implement E.S.’s IEP. 2\n\n       On   November      4,    2005,    the       Shaws   notified    MCPS    that   E.S.\n\nwould not attend a day school and requested that MCPS provide a\n\nresidential placement.            Around the same time, E.S. again began\n\nto    engage    in    self-mutilation           and    tried    to    kill    herself   by\n\nwalking in front of traffic.                   Shortly thereafter, E.S. stopped\n\nattending Foundation.             E.S.’s parents requested that the IEP\n\nTeam re-convene, but MCPS would not comply, citing a lack of any\n\nnew   information       from     the    Shaws        since   the     October   IEP    Team\n\nmeeting a month earlier.               In December, E.S. again tried to kill\n\nherself, this time by cutting herself, and was hospitalized for\n\npsychiatric treatment.\n\n       On   December      29,    2005,     at       E.S.’s   parents’     request,      Dr.\n\nVincent        Cullotta        conducted        a     private        neuropsychological\n\nconsultation, and recommended, based on his consultation, that\n\nE.S. be placed in a therapeutic residential environment, which\n\nwould lessen the risk for E.S. to harm herself or others and\n\n\n       2\n       The Shaws learned some time in the beginning of 2006 that\nOakmont School would close in March of that year.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\falso allow E.S.’s medication usage to be monitored 24 hours a\n\nday.\n\n       On January 3, 2006, E.S.’s parents enrolled E.S. at F.L.\n\nChamberlain       School    (“Chamberlain”),         a     residential         treatment\n\nfacility in Massachusetts.               At Chamberlain, E.S. continued to\n\nattend classes and received clinical therapy during the school\n\nday, as well as additional support outside of the school day.\n\nThe additional support included waking E.S. up and getting her\n\nto class, ensuring that E.S. ate proper meals, and ensuring that\n\nE.S. maintained proper hygiene.\n\n       On March 13, 2006, exercising their right under 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1415(f),    the     Shaws    requested         mediation    and    a     due     process\n\nhearing, seeking reimbursement for the cost of sending E.S. to\n\nChamberlain.       After an unsuccessful session on March 24, 2006,\n\nMCPS transmitted the request for a mediation and hearing to the\n\nOffice     of     Administrative         Hearings.          On    May     18,     2006,\n\nAdministrative Law Judge Jerome Woods, II (the “ALJ”), presided\n\nover a hearing between the parties in Rockville, Maryland.                          The\n\nhearing took place over five days, ending on June 20, 2006.\n\n       On July 18, 2006, the ALJ concluded that the Shaws failed\n\nto establish that E.S.’s placement at Foundation did not provide\n\na FAPE in the least restrictive environment and that they failed\n\nto   establish     that    E.S.    did   not     receive    educational         benefits\n\nduring   her     placement    at    Foundation.          The     Shaws    filed    this\n\n                                           9\n\flawsuit, appealing the ALJ’s decision. 3                         On March 31, 2008, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for MCPS.\n\n\n\n                                                II.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       This Court’s standard of review in an IDEA case such as\n\nthis       varies    somewhat           from    the       de    novo    review        generally\n\napplicable to an award of summary judgment.                                  The standard of\n\nreview in an IDEA case is a “modified” de novo review, where\n\n“due       weight”        is    given      to       the      underlying       administrative\n\nproceedings.         MM, 303 F.3d at 530-531; Doyle v. Arlington County\n\nSch. Bd., 953 F.2d 100, 103 (4th Cir. 1991).                           In connection with\n\nthat       review,    the       findings       of     fact     from    the    administrative\n\nhearing are considered to be prima facie correct; and if the\n\nreviewing court does not adhere to those findings of fact, “it\n\nis obliged to explain why.”                    MM, 303 F.3d at 531.            Nevertheless,\n\nthe    reviewing      court       should       not    substitute       its     own    knowledge\n\nabout       education          policy     for       the    school      district’s.          Id.\n\nAccordingly,         in    our     review,       we       examine     the    entire    record,\n\naffording “due weight” to the administrative findings.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       A party aggrieved by the decision and findings of a due\nprocess hearing may bring a civil action in federal court.  20\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                                       B.\n\n     This case presents two issues on appeal: (1) whether E.S.’s\n\nIEP was legally deficient on its face because of its apparent\n\nfailure to name a specific permanent placement for E.S. and (2)\n\nwhether the ALJ and district court properly concluded that a\n\nprivate day school provided E.S. with a FAPE and that E.S. did\n\nnot require a residential placement under the IDEA.\n\n                                       1.\n\n     The Shaws argue that the IEP developed in October 2005 was\n\ndeficient    as   a   matter   of    law    because    it     failed    to   name    a\n\nspecific    placement    for   E.S.        This   argument     fails.        The   IEP\n\nunambiguously     states     that    Foundation       would    serve    as    E.S.’s\n\ninterim placement while the Shaws explored the three other day\n\nschools    proposed     by   MCPS.      MCPS      provided     these    additional\n\nprivate day placement options, not because Foundation could not\n\nimplement E.S.’s IEP, but as an attempt to accommodate E.S.’s\n\nrequest to change schools.             At no time during the 2005-2006\n\nacademic year was E.S. without an assigned school, such that the\n\nShaws were required to “fend for themselves.”                    Foundation, the\n\nschool indicated in the IEP, provided all the necessary services\n\nlisted in E.S.’s IEP.\n\n     For all of these reasons, this case present a situation far\n\ndifferent than that addressed in A.K. v. Alexandria City Sch.\n\nBd., 484 F.3d 672 (4th Cir. 2007).                In A.K., the student, who\n\n                                       11\n\fsuffered         from       a    nonverbal      learning      disability,             as   well       as\n\nAspergers         Syndrome         and       obsessive       compulsive         disorder,         was\n\nattending         a     residential          program,       pursuant       to     a    settlement\n\nbetween the student’s parents and the school system.                                          Id. at\n\n675-676.          At       the   close    of    the    school      year,    at    an       IEP   team\n\nmeeting about the following academic year, the school system\n\ndeclared that the student should be removed from his residential\n\nplacement and placed in a private day school for the upcoming\n\nschool year.               Id. at 676.        No specific school was listed on the\n\nIEP or discussed in detail at the meeting.                                During the summer,\n\nthe    school         system     sent    out    applications         to    five       private     day\n\nschools on behalf of the student.                        Two of the schools indicated\n\nthat they could not implement the student’s IEP.                                A third school\n\ndid not have room for the student.                          Id.     The parents toured and\n\nresearched the remaining two schools and concluded that neither\n\ncould adequately provide the student with a FAPE.                                Id. at 677.\n\n       We concluded in that case that the student’s IEP failed to\n\nidentify a particular school and was therefore not reasonably\n\ncalculated            to     enable      the     student      to      receive         educational\n\nbenefits.         While the parents agreed that an appropriate private\n\nday school could have provided their child with a FAPE, the IEP\n\nfailed      to    present        such    a     placement.         “[T]he    IEP        development\n\nprocess concluded without any significant discussion of whether\n\nsuch    a    school          existed,     or     if    it    did,    how    it        would      be    a\n\n                                                  12\n\fsatisfactory match for A.K.”               Id. at 681.      Because of this, “the\n\nparents were left to fend for themselves to determine whether\n\nany     private    day    school    in     their    area    .     .   .     would    be    a\n\nsatisfactory fit.”         Id.\n\n       Here, MCPS made a referral to three therapeutic day school\n\nprograms and while these alternatives were being explored, as\n\nthe IEP clearly states, E.S. would continue at Foundation, a\n\nschool that MCPS believed could implement E.S.’s IEP, that was\n\nclearly listed in the IEP, and that had been E.S.’s school for\n\nyears     and     the    subject      of     multiple       IEP       Team     meetings.\n\nAccordingly,       E.S.’s      parents     were    never    left       to    “fend        for\n\nthemselves,”       as    the     parents    in     A.K.    were,      and    the     IEP’s\n\ndesignation of “Foundation” as E.S.’s placement, even though it\n\nwas    listed     as   “interim,”    was    sufficient      to     satisfy     the    IDEA\n\nunder the facts of this case.\n\n                                            2.\n\n       We next turn to the merits of the Shaws’ argument that\n\nplacement at a private day school could not have provided E.S.\n\nwith a FAPE and that a residential placement was necessary for\n\nE.S.     MCPS argues that Foundation provided E.S. with a FAPE and\n\nthat a residential school was required only to address E.S.’s\n\nmental and emotional health issues.                 Based on the record before\n\nus, we agree with MCPS.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       The   state    may   be   required      in   certain       cases   to   fund\n\nresidential placements.          “If the educational benefits which can\n\nbe provided through residential care are essential for the child\n\nto make any educational progress at all, then residential care\n\nis required under the EHA [the precursor to the IDEA].”                        Burke\n\nCounty Bd. of Educ. v. Denton, 895 F.2d 973, 980 (4th Cir. 1990)\n\n(emphasis in original).          However, the IDEA “does not authorize\n\nresidential care merely to enhance an otherwise sufficient day\n\nprogram.”      Id. (quoting Abrahamson v. Hershman, 701 F.2d 223,\n\n227 (1st Cir. 1983) (emphasis in original)).                  “If residential\n\nplacement      is   necessitated    by    medical,    social,       or    emotional\n\nproblems that are segregable from the learning process, then the\n\nlocal education agency need not fund the residential placement.”\n\nId. at 980.         See also Clovis Unified Sch. Dist. v. California\n\nOffice of Admin. Hearings, 903 F.2d 635 (9th Cir. 1990) (finding\n\nstudent’s      hospitalization      was       primarily     for     medical     and\n\npsychiatric reasons and the state was therefore not required to\n\nfund it).\n\n       Kruelle v. New Castle County Sch. Dist., 642 F.2d 687 (3d\n\nCir.   1981)    presents    appropriate       circumstances       under    which   a\n\nresidential placement may be necessary.                   Burke County Bd. of\n\nEduc., 895 F.2d at 980 (adopting the standard articulated in\n\nKruelle).      In Kruelle, a mentally retarded child who was unable\n\nto speak and not toilet trained was found to need extensive\n\n                                         14\n\faround the clock care as part of his FAPE.                       “[T]he concept of\n\neducation is necessarily broad with respect to persons such as\n\nPaul.     ‘Where basic self-help and social skills such as toilet\n\ntraining,      dressing,       feeding    and    communication       are       lacking,\n\nformal education begins at that point.’”                    Id. at 693 (quoting\n\nBattle v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 629 F.2d 269, 275 (3d\n\nCir. 1980)).      See also Abrahamson, 701 F.2d at 228 (holding that\n\nonly    residential     treatment        could   provide     a    FAPE       where   the\n\nstudent could not eat, dress, go to the bathroom, or care for\n\nhimself in any way).\n\n       While Kruelle presents a compelling set of circumstances,\n\nand    residential     placement    may     be   required    where       a    student’s\n\nmedical needs and educational needs are less clearly unitary,\n\nthis case presents facts near the other end of the spectrum.\n\nThe Shaws’ decision to place E.S. in a residential treatment\n\nfacility was based on their desire to ensure E.S. did not hurt\n\nherself, that she took her medicine, and that she was in a safe\n\nenvironment.         The ALJ found based on all of the evidence that\n\nE.S.’s parents’ “demand for residential placement in this case,\n\nis primarily to address the safety needs of the Student as a\n\nresult    of   her    mental    health    issues   and     not    her    educational\n\nneeds.”     JA 1396.     Based on an independent review of the record,\n\nwe agree that the treatment of E.S.’s mental health and safety\n\nissues was distinct and segregable from her educational needs.\n\n                                          15\n\f       We also find that Foundation provided E.S. with a FAPE.\n\nE.S. earned over twenty credits during her time there and, as of\n\nDecember 2004, was passing Art, Physical Education, and Consumer\n\nMath.    Further, Foundation offered E.S. resources to address her\n\naudiological issues, although E.S. did not always elect to use\n\nthose resources.            While E.S.’s educational progress was slowed\n\nduring her psychiatric episodes, the record is clear that during\n\nperiods when E.S.’s mental health issues were stabilized, her\n\neducation progressed.\n\n       Though E.S.’s story is tragic, we must conclude that she\n\npossesses the basic self-help and social skills that the student\n\nin Kruelle lacked and sufficient abilities to proceed in her\n\nstudies in the less restrictive environment of a private day\n\nschool such as Foundation.            It is undisputed that E.S. did not\n\nwant to continue at Foundation and that MCPS hoped to comply\n\nwith her wish to attend another school, but the record also\n\nsupports the ALJ and district court’s conclusion that Foundation\n\ncontinued      to    offer    the   services   and   resources   necessary   to\n\nimplement E.S.’s IEP and that E.S. received some educational\n\nbenefit there.        That E.S.’s emotional and mental needs required\n\na certain level of care beyond that provided at Foundation does\n\nnot necessitate a finding that the state should fund that extra\n\ncare    when    it    can    adequately    address   her   educational   needs\n\nseparately.\n\n                                          16\n\f                                 III.\n\n     Because   the   IDEA   requires   the   provision     of   “the       least\n\nrestrictive    environment”   where    a   student   can   access      a    free\n\nappropriate public education, and because the Court finds that\n\nFoundation offered such an environment, the Court affirms the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment for MCPS.\n\n                                                                    AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\f",

EIG & ASSOCIATES, PC, Chevy\nChase, Maryland, for Appellants.\n\n\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.\n\fPER CURIAM:\n\n      In January 2006, following the refusal of the Montgomery\n\nCounty Board of Education to authorize the placement of their\n\nthen minor child, E.S., into a residential school based on her\n\ndisabilities,       appellants       Richard      Shaw       and     Carol         Shoemaker\n\n(together with E.S., the “Shaws”), unilaterally enrolled E.S. in\n\na residential treatment facility in Massachusetts.                                 They then\n\nfiled   an     action      under     the       Individuals         with    Disabilities\n\nEducation Act (the “IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., against\n\nJerry   Weast,      Superintendent     of       the    Montgomery         County      Public\n\nSchools,      and    the     Montgomery         County       Board        of       Education\n\n(collectively referred to as “MCPS”), seeking reimbursement for\n\nthe cost of that facility, claiming that MCPS violated the IDEA\n\nby denying E.S. a free appropriate public education.                               The Shaws\n\nappeal the district court’s order granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of MCPS.       For the reasons below, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                           I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n     Pursuant to the IDEA, a child with disabilities is entitled\n\nto a “free appropriate public education” (“FAPE”) designed by\n\nthe child’s school district to meet his or her particular needs.\n\n20   U.S.C.    §    1400(d)(1)(A).

In       other    words,     though      a    school\n\ndistrict      must   offer     each   student      a     FAPE,   the     IDEA    does      not\n\nrequire the “furnishing of every special service necessary to\n\nmaximize      each   handicapped       child’s         potential.”         Hartmann        v.\n\nLoudoun County Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743593\"><a href=\"/opinion/743593/mark-hartmann-a-minor-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-roxanna-hartmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001 (4th Cir. 1997)\n\n(quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 199-200).\n\n       The IDEA requires that an “IEP Team,” consisting of the\n\nstudent’s      parents,      the   student’s       teacher,      a     school     district\n\nrepresentative, and, where appropriate, the student, develop an\n\nIndividualized       Educational       Program         (“IEP”)     for    the    student,\n\nsetting forth details on the implementation of the student’s\n\nFAPE.     20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(B).                The IEP contains statements\n\nabout   the    child’s     functioning       levels,       goals,      services       to    be\n\nprovided, and criteria for future evaluations of the child’s\n\nprogress.      Id. at § 1414(d)(1)(A).              It is against this backdrop\n\nthat the Shaws claim that the IEP that MCPS developed failed to\n\nprovide E.S. with a FAPE.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                          B.\n\n     E.S. was born in the Philippines in 1985, and was severely\n\nmalnourished as a young child.             She came to live in an orphanage\n\nthere and, at the age of four, was adopted by Richard Shaw and\n\nCarol Shoemaker who brought E.S. to live in Maryland.\n\n     E.S. has struggled with severe disabilities throughout her\n\nacademic      life,      including       emotional         disturbance,        hearing\n\nimpairment,        speech     and     language     impairment,       and      learning\n\ndisabilities.          E.S.    has     also     been   diagnosed     with      bipolar\n\ndisorder,     clinical        depression,        and     post    traumatic      stress\n\ndisorder, stemming from an alleged unwanted sexual encounter.\n\n     In the middle of seventh grade, E.S. experienced increased\n\nsocial and emotional issues, including suicidal tendencies and\n\nclinical depression.          E.S.’s IEP Team determined that the least\n\nrestrictive environment for E.S. was a full-time, non-public,\n\nspecial education day school.             Accordingly, at the start of her\n\neighth     grade     year,     E.S.     began     at     the    Foundation      School\n\n(“Foundation”), a private special education day school.\n\n     During her first few years at Foundation, E.S. was able to\n\ncomplete over twenty credits.             During the 2003-2004 school year,\n\nhowever,    E.S.      began    to    struggle     with    a     number   of    issues,\n\nincluding depression and loss, and was hospitalized for a period\n\nof time during the school year for suicidal ideations.                        On April\n\n30, 2004, E.S.’s IEP Team met to develop an IEP for the 2004-\n\n                                          4\n\f2005 academic year, taking into account E.S.’s recent problems.\n\nThe    IEP      Team   identified       a    number     of     objectives          for    E.S.     to\n\naddress her audiological, emotional, academic, and other needs,\n\nand the IEP Team agreed that the least restrictive environment\n\nwhere      E.S.’s      IEP   could     be    implemented        remained       at    a        private\n\nseparate day school.                 Accordingly, they determined that E.S.\n\nwould continue at Foundation for the 2004-2005 academic year.\n\n       E.S.’s condition deteriorated during the 2004-2005 school\n\nyear.        During an especially troubling incident in mid-October,\n\nE.S. became agitated and began to engage in self-mutilating acts\n\nwhile at school and had to be physically restrained.                                            As a\n\nresult       of   that       incident,       a   functional           behavior       assessment\n\n(“FBA”) was conducted.                 The FBA results showed that E.S. had\n\nbecome        “increasingly          oppositional             with        staff”     and        more\n\ndisrespectful,          and    that     she      continued           to    engage        in     self-\n\nmutilation at school.                JA 1099.          The FBA also indicated that\n\nE.S. “had difficulty remaining physically safe in situations at\n\nschool and at home.”             Id.        On November 5, 2004, E.S.’s IEP Team\n\nmet to address the issues identified in the FBA and developed a\n\nplan       to     address       some        of       E.S.’s     behavioral           problems. 1\n\nNotwithstanding the implementation of the plan, by December of\n\n       1\n       The plan also addressed E.S.’s hearing issues, but E.S.\ndid not consistently use the resources provided to her, nor did\nshe consistently wear hearing aids or replace the batteries in\nher hearing aids while at Foundation.\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fthat year, E.S.’s interim progress report showed that she was in\n\ndanger of failing four classes, two of which were graduation\n\nrequirements.\n\n         In April 2005, E.S. was hospitalized.                     She was released\n\nfrom the hospital on April 30, 2005, but did not return to\n\nFoundation for the remainder of the school year.                                After her\n\nApril hospitalization, E.S.’s IEP Team met a number of times to\n\ndetermine     the    proper         placement     for    E.S.    for     the    2005-2006\n\nacademic year.         During one of those meetings, E.S. expressed a\n\ndesire not to return to Foundation.                     By September 2005, E.S.’s\n\npsychiatrist, Dr. Michal Potash, recommended that E.S. be placed\n\nin   a    twenty-four        hour    care     facility.         E.S.’s       parents    also\n\nsubmitted     a     recommendation           by   Dr.   William        Stixrud,    Ph.D.,\n\nanother psychologist, stating that E.S. might be able to benefit\n\nfrom placement in a residential facility.\n\n         On September 13, 2005, E.S.’s IEP Team again convened to\n\ndiscuss      whether        E.S.    required      placement       at     a     residential\n\nfacility or whether a private separate day school would satisfy\n\nthe IDEA.      The MCPS staff contended at that meeting that E.S.\n\ncould     continue     at    a     private    separate    day     school,       since    her\n\nissues      were     mainly         mental-health       related,         improvable      by\n\nmedication.        The IEP Team agreed at that meeting that Foundation\n\nwould continue as E.S.’s interim placement.                       Shortly after this\n\nmeeting, an MCPS School Psychologist, Marcia Gustafson, M.Ed.,\n\n                                              6\n\fconducted a review of Dr. Stixrud’s assessment of E.S.                              Based on\n\nher review, Dr. Gustafson concluded that E.S. should be placed\n\nin    a   therapeutic        school       setting       for    students      with    serious\n\nemotional issues.            Dr. Gustafson also concluded, however, that a\n\nresidential      placement          was    not        necessary      to   further      E.S.’s\n\neducation, though it might be necessary to address E.S.’s mental\n\nhealth issues.\n\n      On October 17, 2005, E.S.’s IEP Team met once again to\n\nreview E.S.’s IEP and placement.                      The Team revised E.S.’s IEP to\n\ninclude a number of new accommodations and objectives.                              None of\n\nthese goals and objectives required implementation beyond the\n\nschool    day   and    the     MCPS       IEP    team    members     determined        that   a\n\nprivate     separate     day    school          was    still   the    least     restrictive\n\nenvironment      where       E.S.     could      receive       a   FAPE.        During    the\n\nmeeting, the IEP Team also discussed the Shaws’ request for a\n\nresidential placement for E.S.                   While the MCPS team members did\n\nnot    agree    that     a    residential            placement     was     necessary,     all\n\nparties agreed that there would be a change in E.S.’s school\n\nplacement, to address E.S.’s request that she no longer attend\n\nFoundation.      MCPS identified three alternative private separate\n\nday   schools    for    E.S.:       the    Lodge       School,     Oakmont      School,   and\n\nPathways School.\n\n      On October 19, 2005, MCPS personnel corresponded with the\n\nthree     potential    schools        regarding         whether      or   not   they     could\n\n                                                 7\n\fimplement E.S.’s IEP.              On October 20, 2005, E.S. returned to\n\nFoundation.       Approximately a week later, the Pathways School and\n\nLodge School informed the Shaws that they could not implement\n\nE.S.’s IEP.          During the first week of November, Oakmont School\n\ninformed the Shaws that it could implement E.S.’s IEP. 2\n\n       On   November      4,    2005,    the       Shaws   notified    MCPS    that   E.S.\n\nwould not attend a day school and requested that MCPS provide a\n\nresidential placement.            Around the same time, E.S. again began\n\nto    engage    in    self-mutilation           and    tried    to    kill    herself   by\n\nwalking in front of traffic.                   Shortly thereafter, E.S. stopped\n\nattending Foundation.             E.S.’s parents requested that the IEP\n\nTeam re-convene, but MCPS would not comply, citing a lack of any\n\nnew   information       from     the    Shaws        since   the     October   IEP    Team\n\nmeeting a month earlier.               In December, E.S. again tried to kill\n\nherself, this time by cutting herself, and was hospitalized for\n\npsychiatric treatment.\n\n       On   December      29,    2005,     at       E.S.’s   parents’     request,      Dr.\n\nVincent        Cullotta        conducted        a     private        neuropsychological\n\nconsultation, and recommended, based on his consultation, that\n\nE.S. be placed in a therapeutic residential environment, which\n\nwould lessen the risk for E.S. to harm herself or others and\n\n\n       2\n       The Shaws learned some time in the beginning of 2006 that\nOakmont School would close in March of that year.\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\falso allow E.S.’s medication usage to be monitored 24 hours a\n\nday.\n\n       On January 3, 2006, E.S.’s parents enrolled E.S. at F.L.\n\nChamberlain       School    (“Chamberlain”),         a     residential         treatment\n\nfacility in Massachusetts.               At Chamberlain, E.S. continued to\n\nattend classes and received clinical therapy during the school\n\nday, as well as additional support outside of the school day.\n\nThe additional support included waking E.S. up and getting her\n\nto class, ensuring that E.S. ate proper meals, and ensuring that\n\nE.S. maintained proper hygiene.\n\n       On March 13, 2006, exercising their right under 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1415(f),    the     Shaws    requested         mediation    and    a     due     process\n\nhearing, seeking reimbursement for the cost of sending E.S. to\n\nChamberlain.       After an unsuccessful session on March 24, 2006,\n\nMCPS transmitted the request for a mediation and hearing to the\n\nOffice     of     Administrative         Hearings.          On    May     18,     2006,\n\nAdministrative Law Judge Jerome Woods, II (the “ALJ”), presided\n\nover a hearing between the parties in Rockville, Maryland.                          The\n\nhearing took place over five days, ending on June 20, 2006.\n\n       On July 18, 2006, the ALJ concluded that the Shaws failed\n\nto establish that E.S.’s placement at Foundation did not provide\n\na FAPE in the least restrictive environment and that they failed\n\nto   establish     that    E.S.    did   not     receive    educational         benefits\n\nduring   her     placement    at    Foundation.          The     Shaws    filed    this\n\n                                           9\n\flawsuit, appealing the ALJ’s decision. 3                         On March 31, 2008, the\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for MCPS.\n\n\n\n                                                II.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       This Court’s standard of review in an IDEA case such as\n\nthis       varies    somewhat           from    the       de    novo    review        generally\n\napplicable to an award of summary judgment.                                  The standard of\n\nreview in an IDEA case is a “modified” de novo review, where\n\n“due       weight”        is    given      to       the      underlying       administrative\n\nproceedings.

In connection with\n\nthat       review,    the       findings       of     fact     from    the    administrative\n\nhearing are considered to be prima facie correct; and if the\n\nreviewing court does not adhere to those findings of fact, “it\n\nis obliged to explain why.”                    MM, 303 F.3d at 531.            Nevertheless,\n\nthe    reviewing      court       should       not    substitute       its     own    knowledge\n\nabout       education          policy     for       the    school      district’s.          Id.\n\nAccordingly,         in    our     review,       we       examine     the    entire    record,\n\naffording “due weight” to the administrative findings.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n       A party aggrieved by the decision and findings of a due\nprocess hearing may bring a civil action in federal court.  20\nU.S.C. § 1415(i)(2).\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                                       B.\n\n     This case presents two issues on appeal: (1) whether E.S.’s\n\nIEP was legally deficient on its face because of its apparent\n\nfailure to name a specific permanent placement for E.S. and (2)\n\nwhether the ALJ and district court properly concluded that a\n\nprivate day school provided E.S. with a FAPE and that E.S. did\n\nnot require a residential placement under the IDEA.\n\n                                       1.\n\n     The Shaws argue that the IEP developed in October 2005 was\n\ndeficient    as   a   matter   of    law    because    it     failed    to   name    a\n\nspecific    placement    for   E.S.        This   argument     fails.        The   IEP\n\nunambiguously     states     that    Foundation       would    serve    as    E.S.’s\n\ninterim placement while the Shaws explored the three other day\n\nschools    proposed     by   MCPS.      MCPS      provided     these    additional\n\nprivate day placement options, not because Foundation could not\n\nimplement E.S.’s IEP, but as an attempt to accommodate E.S.’s\n\nrequest to change schools.             At no time during the 2005-2006\n\nacademic year was E.S. without an assigned school, such that the\n\nShaws were required to “fend for themselves.”                    Foundation, the\n\nschool indicated in the IEP, provided all the necessary services\n\nlisted in E.S.’s IEP.\n\n     For all of these reasons, this case present a situation far\n\ndifferent than that addressed in A.K. v. Alexandria City Sch.\n\nBd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797569\"><a href=\"/opinion/797569/ak-a-minor-by-his-parents-and-next-friends-jk-and-es-v-alexandria/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2007).

During the summer,\n\nthe    school         system     sent    out    applications         to    five       private     day\n\nschools on behalf of the student.                        Two of the schools indicated\n\nthat they could not implement the student’s IEP.                                A third school\n\ndid not have room for the student.                          Id.     The parents toured and\n\nresearched the remaining two schools and concluded that neither\n\ncould adequately provide the student with a FAPE.                                Id. at 677.\n\n       We concluded in that case that the student’s IEP failed to\n\nidentify a particular school and was therefore not reasonably\n\ncalculated            to     enable      the     student      to      receive         educational\n\nbenefits.         While the parents agreed that an appropriate private\n\nday school could have provided their child with a FAPE, the IEP\n\nfailed      to    present        such    a     placement.         “[T]he    IEP        development\n\nprocess concluded without any significant discussion of whether\n\nsuch    a    school          existed,     or     if    it    did,    how    it        would      be    a\n\n                                                  12\n\fsatisfactory match for A.K.”               Id. at 681.      Because of this, “the\n\nparents were left to fend for themselves to determine whether\n\nany     private    day    school    in     their    area    .     .   .     would    be    a\n\nsatisfactory fit.”         Id.\n\n       Here, MCPS made a referral to three therapeutic day school\n\nprograms and while these alternatives were being explored, as\n\nthe IEP clearly states, E.S. would continue at Foundation, a\n\nschool that MCPS believed could implement E.S.’s IEP, that was\n\nclearly listed in the IEP, and that had been E.S.’s school for\n\nyears     and     the    subject      of     multiple       IEP       Team     meetings.\n\nAccordingly,       E.S.’s      parents     were    never    left       to    “fend        for\n\nthemselves,”       as    the     parents    in     A.K.    were,      and    the     IEP’s\n\ndesignation of “Foundation” as E.S.’s placement, even though it\n\nwas    listed     as   “interim,”    was    sufficient      to     satisfy     the    IDEA\n\nunder the facts of this case.\n\n                                            2.\n\n       We next turn to the merits of the Shaws’ argument that\n\nplacement at a private day school could not have provided E.S.\n\nwith a FAPE and that a residential placement was necessary for\n\nE.S.     MCPS argues that Foundation provided E.S. with a FAPE and\n\nthat a residential school was required only to address E.S.’s\n\nmental and emotional health issues.                 Based on the record before\n\nus, we agree with MCPS.\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f       The   state    may   be   required      in   certain       cases   to   fund\n\nresidential placements.          “If the educational benefits which can\n\nbe provided through residential care are essential for the child\n\nto make any educational progress at all, then residential care\n\nis required under the EHA [the precursor to the IDEA].”                        Burke\n\nCounty Bd. of Educ. v.

See also Abrahamson, 701 F.2d at 228 (holding that\n\nonly    residential     treatment        could   provide     a    FAPE       where   the\n\nstudent could not eat, dress, go to the bathroom, or care for\n\nhimself in any way).\n\n       While Kruelle presents a compelling set of circumstances,\n\nand    residential     placement    may     be   required    where       a    student’s\n\nmedical needs and educational needs are less clearly unitary,\n\nthis case presents facts near the other end of the spectrum.\n\nThe Shaws’ decision to place E.S. in a residential treatment\n\nfacility was based on their desire to ensure E.S. did not hurt\n\nherself, that she took her medicine, and that she was in a safe\n\nenvironment.         The ALJ found based on all of the evidence that\n\nE.S.’s parents’ “demand for residential placement in this case,\n\nis primarily to address the safety needs of the Student as a\n\nresult    of   her    mental    health    issues   and     not    her    educational\n\nneeds.”     JA 1396.     Based on an independent review of the record,\n\nwe agree that the treatment of E.S.’s mental health and safety\n\nissues was distinct and segregable from her educational needs.\n\n                                          15\n\f       We also find that Foundation provided E.S. with a FAPE.\n\nE.S. earned over twenty credits during her time there and, as of\n\nDecember 2004, was passing Art, Physical Education, and Consumer\n\nMath.    Further, Foundation offered E.S. resources to address her\n\naudiological issues, although E.S. did not always elect to use\n\nthose resources.            While E.S.’s educational progress was slowed\n\nduring her psychiatric episodes, the record is clear that during\n\nperiods when E.S.’s mental health issues were stabilized, her\n\neducation progressed.\n\n       Though E.S.’s story is tragic, we must conclude that she\n\npossesses the basic self-help and social skills that the student\n\nin Kruelle lacked and sufficient abilities to proceed in her\n\nstudies in the less restrictive environment of a private day\n\nschool such as Foundation.            It is undisputed that E.S. did not\n\nwant to continue at Foundation and that MCPS hoped to comply\n\nwith her wish to attend another school, but the record also\n\nsupports the ALJ and district court’s conclusion that Foundation\n\ncontinued      to    offer    the   services   and   resources   necessary   to\n\nimplement E.S.’s IEP and that E.S. received some educational\n\nbenefit there.        That E.S.’s emotional and mental needs required\n\na certain level of care beyond that provided at Foundation does\n\nnot necessitate a finding that the state should fund that extra\n\ncare    when    it    can    adequately    address   her   educational   needs\n\nseparately.\n\n                                          16\n\f                                 III.\n\n     Because   the   IDEA   requires   the   provision     of   “the       least\n\nrestrictive    environment”   where    a   student   can   access      a    free\n\nappropriate public education, and because the Court finds that\n\nFoundation offered such an environment, the Court affirms the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment for MCPS.\n\n                                                                    AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                  17\n\f</pre>",
