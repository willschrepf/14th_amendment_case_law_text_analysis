INTRODUCTION\n\n       This matter comes before the court on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by\n\nKhairulla Said WaH Khairkhwa (ISN 579) (\"the petitioner\"), an Afghan national detained at the\n\nUnited States Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (\"GTMO\"). The government contends\n\nthat the petitioner, a former senior Taliban official, is lawfully detained because he was part of\n\nTaliban forces and purposefully and materially supported such forces in hostilities against the\n\nUnited States. The petitioner maintains that his detention is unlawful because he was merely a\n\ncivilian administrator in the Taliban government with no involvement in the Taliban's military\n\noperations, and because he had disassociated himself from the Taliban by the time ofhis capture.\n\n       In March 2011, the court held a merits hearing to assess the lawfulness of the petitioner's\n\ndetention. During the eourse of that hearing, the parties introduced dozens of exhibits from a\n\n\n\n\n                                             SECREl\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                               SECItE'f\n\nvariety of classified and public sources, including media reports, scholarly works, interrogation\n\nreports and declarations from intelligence analysts. The court also received live testimony and\n\ndeclarations from subject matter experts offered by the petitioner. At the conclusion of the\n\nhearing, both parties submitted detailed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nencapsulating and amplifying the evidence and argument presented during the merits hearing,)\n\n       Having carefully considered the parties' extensive presentations, the court reaches the\n\nfollowing findings. The petitioner was, without question, a senior member of the Taliban both\n\nbefore and after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. The petitioner served as\n\na Taliban spokesperson, the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister, the Taliban Governor of Kabul\n\nand a member of the Taliban's highest governing body, the Supreme Shura. The petitioner was a\n\nclose associate ofTaliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who appointed him Governor of the\n\nprovince of Herat in 1999. The petitioner held this office at the time the Taliban government feU\n\nto U.S. coalition forces in late 2001.\n\n       Although the petitioner contends that he had no military responsibilities in any of his\n\nposts within the Taliban, the record belies that contention. The petitioner has repeatedly\n\nadmitted that after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he served as a member of a\n\nTaliban envoy that met clandestinely with senior Iranian officials to discuss Iran's offer to\n\nprovide the Taliban with weapons and other military support in anticipation of imminent\n\nhostilities with U.S. coalition forces. The petitioner has also exhibited a detailed knowledge\n\nabout sensitive military-related matters, such as the ]ocations, personnel and resources ofTaliban\n\nmilitary installations, the relative capabilities of different weapons systems and the locations of\n\n\n       The government has objected to the petitioner's reliance on eleven documents that were not made\n       a part of the record, but are nevertheless cited in the petitioner's proposed findings of facts and\n       conclusions of law. See generally Govt.'s Opp. To Petr's Reliance on Materials Outside the\n       Record. The government's objection is overruled.\n\n\n                                           SECRET \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nweapons caches. Furthermore, the petitioner operated within the Taliban's fonnal command\n\nstructure, providing material support to Taliban fighters both before and after the outset of\n\nhostilities with U.s. coalition forces. These facts are consistent with the TaHban's governance\n\nmodel, in which nearly all senior Taliban officials were tasked with both civilian and miHtary\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n        Despite the petitioner's efforts to portray himself as a reluctant, marginal figure within\n\nthe Taliban, the record indicates that the petitioner rose to the highest level of the Taliban and\n\nhad close ties to Mullah Omar, who repeatedly appointed the petitioner to sensitive, high-profile\n\npositions. Indeed, even after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, the petitioner remained\n\nwithin Mullah Omar's inner circle, despite the fact that Mullah Omar had Hmited his contacts to\n\nonly his most trusted commanders.\n\n        The petitioner remained part of Taliban forces at the time of his capture in early 2002.\n\nAlthough the petitioner contacted individuals allied with the United States to discuss the\n\npossibility of surrendering himself to U.S. coalition forces, he never turned himself in and was\n\nultimately captured at the home of a senior Taliban military commander.\n\n        In sum, based on a totality of the evidence, the court concludes that the government has\n\nproven by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner was part of Taliban forces at the\n\ntime of his capture. The petitioner is therefore lawfully detained and his petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus must be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8EyRET \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n                                          II.

The petitioner has been detained at GTMO since approximately March 2002.\n\n                                          B. Procedural History\n\n           In June 2008, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Boumediene v. Bush, 12& S. Ct. 2229\n\n(2008), in which the Court held that individuals detained at GTMO are \"entitled to the privilege\n\n\n           The merits hearing occurred on March 28-31, 2011.

See\n           infra Part IV.B.2.\n                                                SECRET\n                                                        5\n\n                             UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                             SECRtyf'\n\n\nof habeas corpus to challenge the legality of their detention,\" id. at 2262, and that the federal\n\ndistrict courts have jurisdiction over such challenges, id. at 2274. Shortly thereafter, the\n\npetitioner fi1ed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the legality ofhis detention at\n\nGTMO. See generally Pet.\n\n       Although the Supreme Court did not specify what procedures the district courts were to\n\nemploy in resolving habeas petitions fi1ed by GTMO detainees, it did emphasize that the\n\n\"detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing.\" Boumediene, 128 S.\n\nCt. at 2275. Toward that end, this court and other judges in this district agreed to consolidate\n\ntheir cases before Judge Hogan for the purpose of adopting common procedures for the GTMO\n\ndetainee litigation. See Minute Order (Oct. 29,2008). On November 6, 2008, Judge Hogan\n\nissued a Case Management Order (\"CMO\") to govern these proceedings, which he amended on\n\nDecember 16, 2008. See generally Am. CMO (Dec. 16, 2008). This court adopted the\n\nprovisions of the amended CMO, subject to modifications set forth in an Omnibus Order issued\n\non April 23, 2009. See generally Omnibus Order (Apr. 23, 2009).\n\n       The government filed its factual return for the petitioner in December 2008. See\n\ngenerally Factual Return. Following an extensive period ofdiscovery, the petitioner filed\n\nhis traverse in December 2009. 6 See generally Traverse. In April 2010, the parties filed cross-\n\nmotions for judgment on the record. See generally Govt's Mot. for J. on the R.; Petr's Cross-\n\nMot. for J. on the R. The court denied the parties' cross-motions after concluding that there were\n\ngenuine issues of material fact in dispute, and scheduled a merits hearing to begin in November\n\n\n\n        The court granted the government's motion for leave to amend the factual return in September\n        2010, Mem. Op. (Sept. 16,2010) at 3-6, and in early March 2011, granted both the government's\n        unopposed second motion for leave to amend the factual return and the petitioner's unopposed\n        motion for leave to amend the traverse, Order (Mar. 7,2011). The court granted the\n        government's unopposed third motion for leave to amend the factual return on March 25, 2011.\n        Minute Order (Mar. 25, 2011).

During the course\n\nof the hearing, the parties introduced dozens of exhibits and offered extensive argument\n\nconcerning the lawfulness of the petitioner's detention. The court also received live testimony\n\nfrom a subject matter expert called by the petitioner. See infra Part III.D. At the conclusion of\n\nthe merits hearing, the parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. With\n\nthe record now complete, the court turns to the applicable legaI standards and the evidence and\n\nargument presented by the parties.\n\n\n\n                                III. EVIDENTIARY MATTERS\n\n                           A. Framework for Assessing the Evidence\n\n       In assessing whether the government has shown that the petitioner is lawfully detained,\n\nthe court \"must evaluate the raw evidence, finding it to be sufficiently reliable and sufficiently\n\nprobative to demonstrate the truth of the asserted proposition with the requisite degree of\n\ncertainty.\" Bensayah v. Obama, 610 F.3d 725, 725 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Parhat v. Gates,\n\n532 F.3d 834, 847 (D.C. Cir. 2008)). Thus, when relying on any piece of evidence in these\n\nGTMO habeas proceedings, the court must examine that evidence to \"detennine whether the\n\nevidence is in fact sufficiently reliable to be used as a justification for detention.\" Khan v.\n\nObama, 646 F. Supp. 2d 6, 12 (D.D.C. 2009); see also Naji al Warafi v. Obama, 704 F. Supp. 2d\n\n32,38 (D.D.C. 2010) (observing that \"[iJn Guantanamo habeas proceedings, the Court must\n\nassess the accuracy, reliability, and credibility of each piece of evidence presented by the parties\n\nin the context of the evidence as a whole\" (internal quotation marks omitted»).\n\n                                          SECRET \n\n                                                  7\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       The reliability of any piece of evidence may be established by the intrinsic characteristics\n\nof that evidence, such as the nature and consistency of the details contained in an account,\n\nBarhoumi v. Obama, 609 F.3d 416,      428~29   (D.C. Cir. 2010), as well as through corroboration by\n\nother evidence in the record, id. at 429 (noting that \"an intelligence report's reliability can be\n\nassessed by comparison to 'exogenous information\"'); Bensayah, 610 F.3d at 725-26 (citing\n\nParhat, 532 F.3d at 849). Two pieces of evidence, \"each unreliable when viewed alone,\" can\n\ncorroborate each other and mutually establish their reliability. Bensayah, 610 F.3d at 726 (citing\n\nUnited States v. Laws, 808 F.2d 92, 100-03 (D.C. Cir. 1986».\n\n       In this case, the government has based its case on a variety of classi1ied and public\n\nmaterials, including scholarly works, media reports, expert declarations, intelligence reports,\n\ninterrogation reports reflecting statements made by the petitioner and other detainees and\n\ntranscripts ofthe petitioner's testimony to the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (\"CSRT\") and\n\nthe Administrative Review Board (\"ARB\"). A number of these documents contain multiple\n\nlevels of hearsay. See FED. R. EVID. 801(c). As dictated by this Circuit, the court shall\n\nindividually assess the reliability of each exhibit that it relies on in the course of its analysis. See\n\ninfra Part IV.\n\n                       B. Admissibility and Reliability of Hearsay Evidence\n\n        Prior to the merits hearing, the government submitted a motion in which it argued that the\n\ncourt should afford a presumption of accuracy and authenticity to its hearsay evidence. See\n\ngenerally Govt's Hearsay Mot. Noting that the motion was substantively identical to motions\n\nresolved by this court in other GTMO cases, the court granted in part and denied in part the\n\ngovernment's motion in an order issued prior to the merits hearing.

Supp.2d 1, 7-10 (D. D.C. 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 632 F. 3d 720 (D.C. Cir. 2011». The\n\nreasoning underlying the court's ruling is set forth in greater detail below.\n\n          The Circuit has made clear that although \"hearsay evidence is always admissible in\n\nGuantanamo habeas proceedings, such evidence must be accorded weight only in proportion to\n\nits reliability.\" Barhoumi, 609 F.3d at 428 (D.C. Cir. 2010). As the Circuit has stated, \"the\n\nquestion a habeas court must ask when presented with hearsay is not whether it is admissible - it\n\nis always admissible - but what probative weight to ascribe to whatever indicia of reliability it\n\nexhibits.\" Al Bihani v. Obama, 590 F.3d 866,879 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\n         Nothing in these Circuit decisions suggests that the court should presume the accuracy or\n\nreliability ofthe government's exhibits; to the contrary, as previously noted, the Circuit has\n\nstated that before relying on any piece of evidence, the court must determine that it is sufficiently\n\nreliable and probative. Bensayah, 610 F.3d at 725 (citing Parhat, 532 F.3d at 847); cf Al Odah\n\nV.   Obama, 611 F.3d 8, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (holding that the district court did not err in relying on\n\nhearsay evidence where \"[t]he government offered reasons why its hearsay evidence had indicia\n\nof reliability, and the court considered the reliability of the evidence in deciding the weight to\n\ngive the hearsay evidence\").\n\n          Drawing on these principles, this court has held that although hearsay evidence is always\n\nadmissible in these habeas proceedings, the court cannot presume the accuracy of such evidence,\n\nbut must instead make individualized determinations about the reliability and accuracy of that\n\nevidence and the weight it is to be afforded. A/sabri, 2011 WL 576064, at *5 (citing Hatim, 677\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 10)). The court has also held that based on the principles underlying Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 803(6), which sets forth the hearsay exception for reports of regularly conducted\n\nactivity, the government's interrogation reports and intelligence reports are entitled to a\n\n                                          SECRE1· \n\n                                                   9\n\n\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npresumption of authenticity. Id; see also Almerfedi v. Obama, 2010 WL 691944, at \"'1 (D.D.C.\n\nMar. 1,2010) (concluding that all of the government's hearsay evidence was admissible and that\n\nany evidence created and maintained by the government in the ordinary course of business was\n\nentitled to a rebuttable presumption of authenticity, but rejecting the government's argument that\n\nits evidence should be afforded a presumption of accuracy). As described below, the court has\n\napplied the same framework in assessing the hearsay evidence introduced by the government in\n\nthis case. See infra Part IV.\n\n                                C. Reliance on Ex Parte Information\n\n       During the course of this litigation, the government has filed a number of motions for\n\nleave to provide the petitioner with redacted versions of certain documents that are subject to the\n\nautomatic disclosure provisions of the CMO. The motions were brought pursuant to § LF of the\n\nCMO, which provides that \"[i]fthe government objects to providing the petitioner's counsel with\n\nclassified information [otherwise subject to disclosure], the government shall move for an\n\nexception to disclosure.\" CMO § I.F. Relying on the Circuit's ruling inAI Odah, the court\n\nissued a series of rulings on these motions, ultimately granting the government leave to redact\n\nportions of certain documents disclosed to the petitioner. See, e.g., Mem. Order (May 25, 2010);\n\nMem. Order (Oct. 5, 201 0) (granting in part and holding in abeyance in part the government's\n\nrenewed fourth ex parte motion for exception from disclosure and directing the government to\n\nprovide further explanation for its redaction to one document); see also Al Odah v. United States,\n\n559 F.3d 539,545-47 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (concluding that the court may order the disclosure of\n\nclassified information to the petitioner only if the evidence is material, access by petitioner's\n\ncounsel is necessary to facilitate meaningful habeas review and there are no adequate alternatives\n\nto disclosure).\n                                           SECRET\n                                                 10 \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       In June 2010, the petitioner filed a motion seeking access to the government's ex parte\n\nfilings. See generally Petr's Mot. for Access to Ex Parte Filings. The court denied the motion,\n\nconcluding that § I.F of the CMO contemplates ex parte applications for exceptions from\n\ndisclosure. Mem. Op. (Sept. 16,2010) at 6-9. In so ruling, however, the court noted that it had\n\nno intention of relying on any redacted, ex parte information in determining the legality of the\n\npetitioner's detention.' Id at 8-9.\n\n       On March 27, 20 II, the government filed a motion, in which it argued that the court\n\nshould, in assessing the lawfulness ofthe petitioner's detention, consider ex parte certain\n\ninformation redacted from the documents disclosed to the petitioner. s See generally Govt's Mot.\n\nthat the Court Consider on the Merits Infonnation Contained in Its 3d & 5th CMO § LF. Motions\n\n(\"Govt's Mot. for Ex Parte Consideration\"). According to the government, the Circuit's ruling\n\nin Al Odah implicitly acknowledges the court's authority to rely on ex parle materials when the\n\npetitioner's access to that infonnation is not necessary to facilitate the court's meaningful review.\n\nSee generally id The petitioner disagrees, citing the well-established presumption against the\n\ncourt's reliance on materials to which both parties do not enjoy access. See generally Petr's\n\nOpp'n to Govt's Mot. for Ex Parte Consideration.\n\n       The court is aware that at least one judge in this district has relied on ex parte infonnation\n\nto assess the reliability of materials submitted by the government during a merits hearing. See\n\nKhan v. Ohama, 741 F. Supp. 2d 1, 17 (D.D.C. 2010) (noting that the court conducted an ex\n\nparte review ofunredacted copies of certain intelligence reports to assess their reliability). In\n\nthis immediate case, however, the court finds it unnecessary to rule on the issue because, as\n\n7\n        The court reiterated this position in its ruling on the government's fifth ex parte motion for\n        exception from disclosure. Mem. Order (Mar. 11,2011) at 3 n.ll.\n\n        The government submitted unredacted versions                   ts at issue with its ex parte\n        motions for exception from djsclosure.a.\"\"l<~-+~\"\"\"!'-f\"\"\"'''''\n                                                \"I.'\"\n                                                        11\n\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ndiscussed below, the evidence to which both parties had access amply establishes the lawfulness\n\nofthe petitioner's detention. See infra Part IV. Accordingly, the court denies the government's\n\nmotion as moot.\n\n                            D. Qualification of the Petitioner's Experts\n\n        During the merits hearing, the petitioner sought to introduce testimony from two\n\nindividuals proffered as expert witnesses: Hekmat Karzai and Brian Williams. Karzai submitted\n\na declaration on the petitioner's behalf, see generally PE 110 (Decl. of Hekmat Karzai), and\n\ntestified at the merits hearing, see Mar. 31 Tr. at 45-152. Williams also offered a declaration on\n\nthe petitioner's behalf, see generally PE lIlA (Decl. of Brian Williams), though he did not\n\ntestify at the merits hearing. 9\n\n        Following extensive voir dire by the government, the court concluded that Karzai was\n\nqualified to offer expert testimony on each of the matters addressed in his declaration. Mar. 31\n\nTr. at 92. The court also heard extensive argument from the parties regarding Williams's\n\nqualifications to offer expert testimony in this case, though it declined to rule on the matter\n\nduring the hearing.\n\n        In the following sections, the court explains in greater detail the basis for its ruling on\n\nKarzai's qualifications and assesses the expert qualifications of Williams. The court begins by\n\nbriefly recounting the general principles governing the qualification of expert witnesses.\n\n                  1. Legal Standard for the Qualification of Expert Witnesses\n\n        Federal Rule of Evidence 702 provides that a witness must qualify as an expert to testify\n\non matters that are scientific, technical or specialized in nature. See FED. R. EVID. 702. The\n\ncourt must act as a \"gatekeeper\" and determine the admissibility of expert testimony and the\n\n\n        Neither Karzai nor Williams obtained access to or testified on the basis of classified materials in\n        this case.\n\n\n                                                    12\n\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nqualifications of expert witnesses. Meister v. Med Eng'g Corp., 267 F.3d 1123, 1127 n.9 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2001) (quoting Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579,592 n.10 (1993»). The\n\ntrial court's gatekeeping obligation applies not only to scientific testimony but to all expert\n\ntestimony. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 148 (1999).\n\n       In general, Rule 702 has been interpreted to favor admissibility. See Daubert, 509 U.S. at\n\n587; see also FED. R. EVlD. 702 advisory committee's note (2000) (\"A review ofthe caselaw\n\nafter Daubert shows that the rejection of expert testimony is the exception rather than the rule.\").\n\nThe adversarial system remains the \"traditional and appropriate\" mechanism for exposing \"shaky\n\nbut admissible evidence.\" FED. R. EVlD. 702 advisory committee's note (2000) (quoting\n\nDaubert, 509 U.S. at 596). Nonetheless, the party presenting the expert bears the burden, by a\n\n\"preponderance of proof,\" of establishing the qualifications of the proposed expert. Meister, 267\n\nF.3d at 1127 n.9.\n\n       Rule 702 does not specify any particular means for qualifying an expert, requiring only\n\nthat the witness possess the \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" necessary to\n\n\"assist\" the trier of fact. FED. R. EVID. 702. As the Supreme Court stated in Daubert, the trial\n\ncourt must determine whether the proposed expert possesses \"a reliable basis in the knowledge\n\nand experience of [the relevant] discipline.\" 509 U.S. at 592. In considering whether this\n\nstandard is met, courts may consider the factors articulated in Daubert, such as (1) whether the\n\nexpert's technique or theory can be or has been tested; (2) whether the technique or theory has\n\nbeen subject to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the\n\ntechnique or theory when applied; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards and controls;\n\nand (5) whether the technique or theory has been generally accepted in the scientific community.\n\nId\n\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                                 tJJ!Cft'l!';)\n\n       The Supreme Court has, however, noted that the Daubert factors are not exclusive and\n\nmay not apply in all cases. Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 150-51 (noting that Rule 702 envisions\n\na \"flexible\" inquiry). In cases in which the Daubert factors do not apply, \"reliability concerns\n\nmay focus on personal knowledge or experience.\" Groobert v. President & Dirs. o/Georgetown\n\nCoil., 219 F. Supp. 2d 1,6 (D.D.C. 2002) (citing Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 149). Formal\n\neducation ordinarily suffices, and a person who holds a graduate degree typically qualifies as an\n\nexpert in his or her field. See, e.g., Lavespere v. Niagara Mach. & Tool Works, Inc., 910 F.2d\n\n167,176-77 (5th Cir. 2010); Am. Gen. Life. Ins. Co. v. Schoenthal Family, LLC, 555 F.3d 1331,\n\n1338-39 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n       There is, however, no requirement that an expert possess formal education, and an expert\n\nmay be qualified on the basis ofhis or her practical experience. See, e.g., Thomas v. Newton\n\nInt'/ Enters., 42 F.3d 1266, 1269-70 (9th Cir. 1994) (concluding that a longshoreman with\n\ntwenty-nine years of experience in various positions within the industry was qualified to testify\n\nas an expert about proper safety procedures). As noted in the advisory committee notes to Rule\n\n702, \"[i]f the witness is relying solely or primarily on experience, then the witness must explain\n\nhow that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for\n\nthe opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.\" FED. R. EVID. 702 advisory\n\ncommittee's note (2000).\n\n       The degree of \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" required to qualify\n\nan expert witness ~~is only that necessary to insure that the witness's testimony 'assist' the trier of\n\nfact.\" See Mannino v. Int'/ Mfg. Co., 650 F.2d 846, 851 (6th Cir. 1981) (noting that the weight\n\nof the evidence is a matter to be assessed by the trier of fact). \"[I]t is not necessary that the\n\nwitness be recognized as a leading authority in the field in question or even a member of a\n                                          C\"\n                                                       b, 1 r\" i\n                                                  r.. \".. . ; f'··'{~\".~ '~r\n                                          .....,) t...._\n\n                                                           14\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nrecognized professional commWlity.\" 29 FED.

Hekmat Karzai\n\n       Hekmat Karzai, one of the proposed experts on whom the petitioner relies, is the Director\n\nof the Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies, an independent research institute in Afghanistan\n\ndedicated to reducing the threat of political violence and fostering an environment of peace and\n\nstability in that nation. PE 11 0 1I~ 1-2. Karzai earned a master's degree in strategic studies,\n\nfocusing on issues such as terrorism, militancy and insurgency, has authored scholarly works on\n\nthe Taliban and its relationship with al-Qaida, has traveled extensively in the region and is\n\npersonally acquainted with many former Taliban leaders as well as local Afghan officials. Id. ~\n\n4-6; Mar. 31 Ir. at 46-49,52. He is also a senior fellow at the Joint Special Operations\n\nUniversity, Special Operations Command for the United States Military and regularly briefs\n\nsenior U.S. commanders in Afghanistan. Mar. 31 Tr. at 46-49.\n\n       The petitioner offered Karzai to provide expert testimony on the following subjects: (1)\n\nbackground on the Taliban government and its relations with Iran; (2) a profile of Mullah Omar;\n\nand (3) the petitioner's background and his role within the Taliban government. PE 110117.\n\nFollowing a lengthy voir dire, the government conceded Karzai's qualifications to offer expert\n\ntestimony on the first two of these issues. Mar. 31 Tr. at 89. The government objected,\n\nhowever, to Karzai offering expert testimony on the third issue, arguing that his views on the\n\npetitioner's roles within the Taliban were based more on ipse dixit than on rigorous analysis. ld.\n\nat 89-90. The government noted that Karzai had published no scholarly works about the\n\npetitioner and based his opinions about the petitioner primarily on his discussions with\n\n                                         8ECr{El\" \n\n                                                  15\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nindividuals associated with the petitioner rather than on any rigorous analytical inquiry. Id. at\n\n90. In effect, the government argued, the petitioner was attempting to introduce hearsay\n\nevidence in the guise of expert testimony. Id. at 91.\n\n       The court overruled the government's objection based on the following considerations:\n\nhaving authored a master's thesis on the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaida, as well\n\nas numerous scholarly works on the Taliban and Afghanistan, Karzai had amassed over a decade\n\nofexperience conducting research on issues related to the Taliban and Afghanistan by the time\n\nhe began researching the petitioner in 2006. Id at 44-49,86. Accordingly, Karzai plainly\n\npossessed the training and experience necessary to conduct research into the petitioner, a\n\nprominent and senior member of the Taliban government.\n\n       Indeed, it would appear that in a manner consistent with his training and experience,\n\nKarzai conducted a systematic inquiry into the petitioner. Karzai testified that he formed his\n\nopinions about the petitioner's background and posts within the Taliban by interviewing\n\nnumerous people associated with him, including his family, those who worked with him in the\n\nTaliban government on a daily basis and current senior Afghan government officials. Id. at 83­\n\n85. He also consulted primary and secondary sources, such as local Afghan publications, for\n\ninformation regarding the petitioner's role within the Taliban. Id at 84. Karzai testified that he\n\nsought out a variety of individuals with firsthand knowledge about the petitioner, speaking not\n\nonly with individuals from Taliban-dominated southern Afghanistan, but also with individuals\n\nfrom both the Mazar-e-Sharif region in the north and Herat province in western Afghanistan. ld\n\nat 89. Moreover, Karzai attempted to verify the information he obtained from any source by\n\nseeking corroboration through other sources. [d. at 86-87.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                              SltCRR'f'\n\n\n       The government did not explain why Karzai's reliance on information that he obtained\n\nfrom these interviews precludes him from offering expert testimony, particularly in light of his\n\nefforts to cross-reference and corroborate this information. 1O Although the government\n\nsuggested that the rigor of Karzai' s inquiry was undermined by his persona) desire to see the\n\npetitioner freed, Mar. 31 Tr. at 90-91, in the court's view, this factor is relevant to the weight\n\nafforded to Karzai's testimony, not his expertise.\n\n       Accordingly, based on Karzai's knowledge, training and experience regarding the\n\nTaliban and his efforts to research the petitioner's background and roles within the Taliban, the\n\ncourt concluded during the merits hearing that Karzai was qualified to offer expert testimony on\n\nthe petitioner's background and posts within the Taliban.\n\n                                         3.

See generally PE lIlA. The government does not dispute Williams's\n\nqualifications to offer testimony on subjects one and four. Mar. 31 Tr. at 6. The government\n\nasserts, however, that Williams lacks the qualifications necessary to offer expert testimony on\n\nsubjects two and three, both of which concern the relationship between the Taliban and Iran. ld\n\nMore specifically, the government contends that Williams has little expertise on Afghanistan or\n\nthe Taliban, having focused the majority of his schoJarJy endeavors on the Russian Caucasus and\n\nTurkey, and that he has no specialized education or training on Iran.

Furthennore, Williams has taught at least one course covering\n\nmodem Afghan history, including the period of the Taliban, titled \"Empires and Invasions: A\n\nHistory of Afghanistan from Genghis Khan to the War on Terror.\" GE 95 at 1.\n\n       Given his demonstrated scholarship on the history of the Taliban, as well as the\n\ngovernment's own reliance on him as an expert on matters related to the Taliban, it is clear that\n\nWilliams possesses the specialized knowledge needed to offer expert opinion testimony on the\n\nTaliban and Afghanistan.

See Mar. 31 Tr. at 6.\n\n       Such expertise could not be obtained without developing a specialized knowledge of the\n\nTaliban's relationships with its regional neighbors, including Iran.

ANALYSIS\n\n                   A. The Scope of the Government's Detention Authority\n\n       The government's authority to detain individuals at GTMO derives from the\n\nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\"), which provides that\n\n       the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against\n       those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,\n       committed, or aided the terrorist attack that occurred on September 11, 2001, or\n       harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of\n       international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations,\n       or persons.\n\nPub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001).\n\n       This Circuit has delineated two categories of persons detainable under the AUMF: (1)\n\nindividuals who are \"part of' forces associated with al-Qaida or the Taliban and (2) individuals\n\nwho purposefully and materially supported such forces in hostilities against U.S. coalition forces.\n\nAl Bihani, 590 F 3d at 872; see also id at 874 (noting that \"both prongs are valid criteria that are\n\nindependently sufficient to satisfy the standard\"). The burden rests with the government to\n\ndemonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the detainee falls within one of these\n\n\n\n                                                 20 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                               SEeH\"\n\ncategories of detainable persons. See Awad v. Obama, 608 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (stating\n\nthat \"a preponderance of the evidence standard satisfies constitutional requirements in\n\nconsidering a habeas petition from a detainee held pursuant to the AUMF\"); accord Al Bihan;,\n\n590 F.3d at 878. 13\n\n       The Circuit has observed that because al-Qaida's organizational structure is amorphous,\n\n\"it is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of criteria for determining whether an individual is\n\n'part of al Qaeda.\" Bensayah, 610 F.3d at 725. Accordingly, the district courts must determine\n\nwhether an individual is \"part of\" al-Qaida or associated forces on a \"case-by-case basis\"\n\nemploying a \"functional rather than a formal approach and by focusing upon the actions of the\n\nindividual in relation to the organization.\" Id. \"That an individual operates within al Qaeda's\n\nformal command structure is surely sufficient but is not necessary to show that he is 'part of the\n\norganization.\" Id.; see also Awad, 608 F.3d at 11 (\"Ifthe government can establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that a detainee was part of the 'command structure' of al Qaeda,\n\nthis satisfies the requirement to show that he was 'part of al Qaeda. But there are ways other\n\nthan making a 'command structure' showing to prove that a detainee is 'part of' al Qaeda.\"). On\n\nthe other hand, \"the purely independent conduct of a freelancer is not enough\" to show that an\n\nindividual is detainable as \"part of' of those enemy forces. Bensayah, 610 F.3d at 725; see also\n\nSalahi v. Obama, 625 FJd 745, 752 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (noting that \"the government's failure to\n\nprove that an individual was acting under orders from al-Qaida may be relevant to the question\n\nof whether the individual was 'part of the organization when captured\").\n\n\n13\n        Nevertheless, the Circuit has expressly left open the question of whether a lower evidentiary\n        standard might be constitutionally permissible. See AI-Adahi v. Ohama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1103\n        (D.C. Cir. 2010); see also Esmailv. Ohama, 2011 WL 1327701, at *3 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 8,2011)\n        (Silbennan, J., concurring) (stating that \"in a habeas corpus proceeding the preponderance of\n        evidence standard that the government assumes binds it, is unnecessary - and moreover,\n        unreal istic\").                       j\"         f    '.. f',:!'''

The government must prove, however, that the petitioner was \"part of' the Taliban, al-Qaida\n\nor associated forces at the time of his capture to demonstrate that his detention is lawful under\n\nthe first prong of the standard. See Salahi, 625 F.3d at 751 (observing that \"the relevant inquiry\n\nis whether [the petitioner] was 'part of al-Qaida when captured\"); Gherebi v. Obama, 609 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 43, 71 (D.D.C. 2009).\n\n       Few courts have delved at length into the ''purposeful and material support\" prong of the\n\ndetention standard. It is nonetheless clear that as with the \"part of' prong of the detention\n\nstandard, the inquiry into whether an individual has purposefully and materially supported\n\nhostilities against U.S. coalition forces requires a fact-specific assessment focusing on the actions\n\nof the individual in relation to the organization. See Al-Bihani, 590 F.3d at 873 (noting that even\n\nifthe detainee could prove that he was a civiHan \"contractor\" and was not a formal member of\n\nthe Taliban, the services that he provided to Taliban fighters engaged in hostilities against U.S.\n\ncoalition forces, such as cooking for the unit and carrying a brigade-issued weapon, would render\n\nhim detainable under the support prong of the detention standard).\n\n       In assessing whether the government has met its burden under either prong of the\n\ndetention standard, the court may not view each piece of evidence in isolation, but must consider\n\nthe totality ofthe evidence. See AI-Adahi v. Obama, 613 FJd 1102, 1105-06 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\nEven if no individual piece of evidence would by itselfjustifY the petitioner's detention, the\n\nevidence may, when considered as a whole and in context, nonetheless demand the conclusion\n\nthat the petitioner was more likely than not \"part of' the Taliban or al-Qaida or that the petitioner\n\npurposefully and materially supported such forces.

The Petitioner Is LawfuUy Detained\n\n                         1. The Petitioner Was a Senior Taliban Official\n\n        In many of the GTMO habeas cases litigated since Boumediene, the central question\n\nbefore the court has been whether the detainee knowingly associated himself with the Taliban,\n\nal-Qaida or related enemy forces. To resolve this question, courts have commonly sifted through\n\nevidence of the detainee's presence at training camps and safchouses and assessed the\n\nplausibility of the detainee's claim that he had no intention ofjoining forces hostile to the United\n\nStates. See, e.g., Alsabri, 2011 WL 576064, at *9-32 (analyzing evidence that the detainee had\n\nstayed at al-Qaida and Taliban-affiliated guesthouses and training camps and evaluating the\n\ndetainee's assertion that he traveled from Yemen to Afghanistan to find work and a wife);\n\nKandari v. United States, 744 F. Supp. 2d 11,27-29 (D.D.C. 2010) (assessing the detainee's\n\nassertion that he traveled to Pakistan and then to Afghanistan to obtain religious training and\n\nperform charitable work); Almerfedi v. Ohama, 725 F. Supp. 2d 18,22-31 (DD.C. 2010)\n\n(evaluating the detainee's claim that he traveled from Yemen to Pakistan in the hopes of\n\nfacilitating a missionary trip to Europe, as well as the government's evidence that the petitioner\n\nstayed at al-Qaida affiliated guesthouses).\n\n        This case proceeds from a different footing. Here, there is no dispute about the\n\npetitioner's long history as a member of the Taliban. As previously noted, the petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23 \n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nacknowledges that he began working for the TaJiban in 1994 and that he served as the Taliban's\n\ndistrict administrator in Spin Boldak and spokesperson to media outlets such as the BBC and\n\nVoice of America. GE 91      ~   15; GE 20 at 1-2; GE 45 at 1; GE 70 at 1-2; GE 71 at 3; GE 110,\n\n48. It is undisputed that the petitioner was appointed Governor of Kabul in 1996 and, shortly\n\nthereafter, became the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister. GE 91                                 ~   16; GE 110 ~ 50. It is also\n\nundisputed that in October 1999, the petitioner was appointed Governor of Herat province, a\n\nposition that he held through the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom. GE 91                                         ~~   5,\n\n17. In short, the parties agree that the petitioner was not only functionally part of the Taliban,\n\nbut that he was, in fact, a fonnally-recognized, high-ranking Taliban official at the time of the\n\nU.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n       As a result, the question before the court is not whether the petitioner ever knowingly\n\nassociated himself with the Taliban, but instead, whether the nature and duration of that\n\nassociation renders him lawfully detained under the AUMF. The government contends that the\n\npetitioner is lawfully detained because he was deeply involved in the Taliban's military\n\noperations throughout his tenure with the Taliban, had close ties to Mullah Omar and remained\n\npart of the Taliban at the time of his capture in early 2002.14 The petitioner, in turn, asserts that\n\nalthough he was a senior Taliban official, he had no involvement with the Taliban's military\n\n\n\n\n14\n        During the merits hearing, the government raised a host of additional allegations against the\n        petitioner, including allegations that the petitioner had ties to Usama bin Ladin, harbored a1­\n        Qaida operatives in Herat during his tenure as Governor of Herat and commanded a Taliban\n        garrison at Mazar-e-Sharif during Operation Enduring Freedom. The court declines to address\n        these allegations because the evidence analyzed below is sufficient to establish the lawfulness of\n        the petitioner'S detention. Cj Esmail, 2011 WL 1327701, at *1-3 (affinning the district court's\n        denial of the GTMO detainee's habeas petition, despite the petitioner's argument that the district\n        court erred in relying on coerced statements and uncorroborated evidence, because \"the record\n        contains sufficient facts - affected neither by the alleged coercion nor by the lack of\n        corroboration - to support the district court's conclusion that [the detainee] was 'part of' al\n        Qaeda at the time of his capture\").,             , ;,',      .                       r\n                                             .?...\" .,;:/ ~,,~., ..'~~.,/   ~   \\.

The court considers these matters in turn.\n\n             2. The Petitioner's Involvement With Talihan Military Operations\n\n        Throughout this litigation, the petitioner's chief contention has been that he was merely a\n\ncivilian administrator who had no involvement with the Taliban's military operations.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, the evidence purporting to show that he had obtained military\n\ntraining and experience and possessed military responsibilities is inherently flawed and\n\nunreJiable. The petitioner also relies on the statements of expert witnesses and former Taliban\n\nofficials who claim that the petitioner was merely a civilian bureaucrat with no military\n\nresponsibilities. The petitioner asserts that as a purely civilian official, he was not part of\n\nTaliban forces, did not purposefully and materially support the Taliban in hostilities against U.S.\n\ncoalition forces, and, as a result, is not lawfully detained.\n\n        The government does not dispute that a purely civiHan official who had no connection to\n\nany military activities would not be subject to detention under the AUMF. According to the\n\ngovernment, however, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that like almost all Taliban\n\nleaders, the petitioner obtained military training and experience fighting with the Afghan\n\nmujahideen in the 1980s, and remained deeply involved in the Taliban's military operations until\n\nthe time of his capture in early 2002. The court assesses this evidence in the following sections.\n\n         a.

For instance, Rashid's\n\nreport that Mullah Omar received a madrassa education in Kandahar and fought with the Afghan\n\nmujahideen faction led by Yunas Khalis, GE 48 at 252, is corroborated by Karzai, who has also\n\nwritten articles about Mullah Omar, Mar. 31 Ir. at 79, and stated in his declaration that Mullah\n\nOmar was \"educated in various madrassas in Kandahar,\" PE           Ito, 40, and had \"participated in\nthe Jihad against the Soviet and Afghanistan communist government under the faction led by\n\nYunas Khalis,\" id '42.

Although the petitioner\n\n suggests that he was in his teens for most ofthe Soviet occupation and lacked any forma]\n\n military training, he has not explained how either fact precludes the possibility that he fought\n\n with the Afghan mujahideen or rose through its ranks. Likewise, although the petitioner objects\n\n by stating that Rashid has not identified the sources of his information regarding the petitioner's\n\n background, the petitioner's own experts have acknowledged that Rashid's reporting is based on\n\n his field work in Afghanistan and is highly authoritative.

Accordingly, the weight of the evidence indicates that the petitioner did\n\n fight with the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets.\n\n        That the petitioner fought with the Afghan mujahideen, at a time when those forces were\n\n aJlied with the United States and against the Soviet Union, see PE 67 at 197, hardly establishes\n\n the lawfulness ofhis detention. This finding does, however, serve as an important starting point\n\n for assessing the petitioner's role in the Taliban, for it establishes that the petitioner possessed at\n\n least some military experience by the time he joined the Taliban in 1994, and begins to unravel\n\n the petitioner's assertion that he was merely a civilian bureaucrat with no connection to the\n\n Taliban's military forces.\n\n\n\n\n 19\n         Karzai's testimony about the petitioner is assessed in greater detail later in the following section.\n         See infra Part IV.B.2.b.ii.\n\n\n\n\n                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                  I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n\n\n             h.

The Taliban's Efforts to Capture Mazar-e-Shariff\n\n       As previously noted, by 1992, Afghanistan had descended into civil war, as different\n\nfactions vied for control over the country following the retreat of Soviet forces. By November\n\n1994, Taliban forces had captured Kandahar and by February 1995, had consolidated their\n\ncontrol over the Pashtun lands of southern Afghanistan. PE 110, 11.

By the winter of 1996, the\n\nTaliban controlled twenty-two of Afghanistan's thirty-four provinces. PE 67 at 54. The only\n\nmajor city not under Taliban control was Mazar-e-Sharif, a city near the northern border with\n\nUzbekistan and the stronghold of anti-Taliban General Rashid Dostum, whose Uzbek forces had\n\ninsulated the city from the fighting sweeping through the rest of Afghanistan. Id. at 54.\n\n       In the spring of 1997, the Taliban turned their attention northward. PE 110,14.

The Petitioner's Role in the September 1997 Assault on Mazar-e-Sharif\n\n       Reliable evidence indicates that the petitioner was a commander of Taliban forces during\n\nthe Taliban's failed September 1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif. One such piece of evidence is a\n\nState Department cable dated September 17, 1997, which reports on a discussion held earlier that\n\nday between an unidentified U.S. poJitical officer and Tayyab Husseini, a Taliban representative\n\nat the Taliban-controlled Afghan embassy in Islamabad.

Husseini also stated that Taliban forces were\n\nreceiving assistance from \"pro-Taliban Hezb-i-lslami elements\" attacking the city from the west.\n\nld\n\n       Although the State Department cable contains multiple levels of hearsay, it possesses\n\nample indices of reliability. See id As an initial matter, the petitioner has not suggested that the\n\ncable inaccurately summarizes Husseini's statements. Indeed, the author of the cable appears to\n\nhave taken great pains to provide a detailed account of the discussions between Husseini and the\n\nU.S. political officer, including what purport to be direct quotations from Husseini. ld at 1-3.\n\n       There is also no dispute that Husseini was a political officer and a representative ofthe\n\nTaliban at the time of the September 17, 1997 meeting and that his statements were given\n\nvoluntarily as part of an official diplomatic exchange between the Taliban and the United States.\n\nSee Petr's Proposed Findings of Pact ,,37-39. Husseini not only identified the petitioner as a\n\ncommander of Taliban forces, but also provided a detailed account ofthe petitioner's activities\n\nas a commander, such as his strategic decision to wait for reinforcements before continuing his\n\npush towards Mazar-e-Sharif, and expressly identified the source of his account - nameJy,\n\nreports sent from the field by the petitioner to Taliban leaders in Kandahar. GE 2 at 1.\n\n       Furthermore, many of the details contained in Husseini's account of the fighting around\n\nMazar-e-Sharif are corroborated by other sources in the record. See GE 88 at 103-04 (reporting\n\nthat Hizb-i-Islami forces assisted in the Taliban September 1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif); GE\n\n48 at 229 (noting \"heavy fighting again near Mazar\" on September 18, 1997). The author of the\n\ncable remarks on the plausibility of Husseini's account, noting that \"Hussei(n]i's comments are\n\nno[t] surprising\" and consistent with reports of\"continued fighting around Mazar-i-Sharif on\n\nSeptember 17.\" GE 2 at 1,3.\n                                        (.\n                                        b\n                                             ,\n                                             .\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n                                             SICM'f\n\n       Indeed, other than Husseini's identification of the petitioner as a commander of Taliban\n\nforces, the petitioner has not challenged any other aspects of Husseini's account of the Taliban's\n\nSeptember 1997 assault on Mazar-e-Shari£ Instead, the petitioner speculates that Husseini's\n\naccount might have been motivated by a desire to \"gain political advantage\" and argues that this\n\npossibility renders his statements wholly unreliable. Petr's Proposed Findings of Fact~,-r 38-39.\n\nThe petitioner, however, has not offered any explanation regarding what political advantage\n\ncould conceivably have been gained by falsely identifying the petitioner as a commander of the\n\nTaliban forces. See id. While speculation about Husseini's motivations might call into question\n\nthe accuracy of his characterizations ofthe strength of the Taliban's forces and the imminence of\n\ntheir victory, the petitioner has not attempted to explain how the specter of political motivations\n\ncasts doubt on his identification of the petitioner as a Taliban military commander.\n\n       Moreover, Husseini's statements regarding the petitioner's involvement in the September\n\n1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif are corroborated by a separate account of that campaign authored\n\nby journalist and diplomat Kamal Matinuddin. See GE 88 at 1. In The Taliban Phenomenon,\n\nMatinuddin writes that in September 1997, Truiban forces\n\n        took control of the bypass running towards the river port of Hairatan on the\n        Oxus, thus threatening Mazar-e-Sharif from the rear. Omar had predicted that it\n        would be only a matter of time before the Taliban scored further military\n        victories, and he was not far wrong as, led by Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, they\n        entered Mazar-e-Sharif a day later with the support of Majeed Bacha, Bashir\n        Khan, and Jumma Khan Hamdar, all of whom belonged to the Hikmetyar faction\n        of Hizb-e-Islami.\n\nGE 88 at 103-04.\n\n       Although the petitioner suggests that Matinuddin's account does not independently\n\ncorroborate the State Department cable because Matinuddin may have relied on the same source\n\ncited in the State Department cable, the petitioner has offered nothing to substantiate that theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                             UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nSee GE 88 at 103-04~ GE 2 at 1. In fact, although Matinuddin and Husseini both identify the\n\npetitioner as a commander of Taliban forces and note that Hizb-i-Islami fighters participated in\n\nthe assault, the two accounts otherwise possess few overlapping details. Compare GE 88 at 104\n\n(identifying the specific Hizb-i-Islami leaders who participated in the Taliban's September 1997\n\nassault, a detail not included in the State Department cable) with GE 2 at I (providing\n\ninformation about tactical decisions and the locations offorces involved in the assault, details not\n\npresent in Matinuddin's account).\n\n       The reliability of Matinuddin's account is further supported by the fact that the author is\n\nan experienced military officer, diplomat23 and journalist who has edited and written numerous\n\nworks on Afghanistan. GE 88 at 1. Although the petitioner complains that Matinuddin lacked\n\nfirsthand knowledge of the events at issue and does not identify the sources on which he based\n\nhis account, the petitioner's own subject matter expert lists Matinuddin's The Taliban\n\nPhenomenon as one ofthe most significant \"major scholarly works\" on the rise of the Taliban. 24\n\nPE lilA' 5. Indeed, the petitioner can only point to minor purported inconsistencies between\n\nMatinuddin's account and Rashid's account of the TaIiban's September 1997 offensive,25 and\n\ndoes not challenge any core aspect of Matinuddin's reporting, other than his identification of the\n\n\n23 \t\n       Matinuddin represented Pakistan in several diplomatic capacities, including as its ambassador to\n       Thailand. GE 88 at 1.\n24 \t\n       In fact, Williams's insistence that the petitioner could not have served as a Taliban commander\n\n       not mentioned as a military commander in any these \"major scholarly works.\" PE I 1]     ,9\n       during any of the assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif stems from his erroneous beJief that the petitioner is\n\n       (\"Simply put, had there been a Mullah Khairkhwa leading troops on the northern front from 1997\n       to 1998[,] one of these scholars ... would have recorded his name somewhere.\").\n\n       The petitioner notes that according to Matinuddin, the Taliban captured the town ofTashkurgan\n       on September 9, 1997, GE 88 at 103-04, while Rashid reports that the Taliban captured the same\n       town on September 7, 1997, PE 67 at 62. This minor inconsistency does not, in the court's view,\n       significantly undennine the reliabiJity of either account. Indeed, Matinuddin's and Rashid's\n       accounts of the September 1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif are highly consistent with one\n       another. See GE 88 at 103-04; PE 67 at 62-63, 229.\n\n                                           C\n                                           vLI\n                                               f   f; r ~\";:....,..\"r\n                                                                    ;\n\n                             UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n            .. _ .J..l ...\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npetitioner as a commander of Taliban forces. Based on these considerations, the court concludes\n\nthat Matinuddin's and Husseini's highly consistent accounts of the September 1997 assault on\n\nMazar-e-Sharifare accurate ~nd reliable evidence of the petitioner's role as a Taliban\n\ncommander,\n\n       Furthermore, as discussed below, the petitioner's role as a commander of Taliban forces\n\nin September 1997 is also corroborated by the statements of a former senior officer in the Afghan\n\nmujahideen, who expressly identified the petitioner as a former Taliban military commander,\n\nGE 22 at 1; infra Part IV.B.2.b.iii. The court also notes that the petitioner's role as a commander\n\nof Taliban forces in September 1997 is consistent with the fact that he possessed military\n\nexperience from his participation in the Afghan jihad, see supra Part IV.B.2.a, as well as the\n\nevidence indicating that the petitioner participated in the August 1998 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif,\n\nsee infra Part IV,B.2.b.iiL Thus, the weight ofthe evidence supports the conclusion that the\n\npetitioner was a military commander who led Taliban forces during the Taliban's assault on\n\nMazar-e-Sharif in September 1997.\n\n          iii. The Petitioner's Role in the August 1998 Conquest of Mazar-e-Sharif\n\n       Numerous sources have also reported that after the Taliban's failed September 1997\n\nassault on Mazar-e-Sharif, the petitioner remained a military commander, directing Taliban\n\nfighters during the Taliban's northern offensive in the summer of 1998. One of the earliest of\n\nthese sources is an article published by a western media outlet on July 13, 1998, which reported\n\non the Taliban's fresh bid to seize the northern territories remaining outside their control. GE 4\n\n(Stefan Smith, Taliban Make Major Advance in Northern Afghanistan, AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE,\n\nJuly 13, 1998) at 1. The article, which draws from a wide-variety of sources, including western\n\naid workers, Taliban officials and Radio Shariat (the Taliban-run radio station), reported that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                37 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nTaliban had captured Meymaneh, a city to the southwest of Mazar-e-Sharif, and that this victory\n\nyielded the Taliban 100 enemy tanks and 800 enemy fighters. ld at 1-2. The article further\n\nreported that Taliban forces were poised to push northward toward the cities of Sherberghan and\n\nMazar-e-Sharif. ld According the article, \"Tali ban officials were tight-lipped over the militia's\n\nplans, and said the student movement was busy consolidating their positions, with battle-veteran\n\nand interior minister Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa heading the operation.\" fd at 2 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          This July 13,1998 report is consistent with Rashid's account that on July 12, 1998,\n\nTaliban forces captured Meymaneh and seized\" 100 tanks and vehicles and some 800 Uzbek\n\nsoldiers.\" GE 48 at 72. The report is also consistent with a July 12, 1998 news report stating\n\nthat Taliban soldiers had conquered the city of Meymaneh and that Mullah Omar had appointed\n\n\"(Interior minister) Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa to oversee the captured areas and to ensure the\n\nhundreds of prisoners taken are well treated.,,26 GE 3 (Taleban Claim Sweep ofAfghanistan's\n\nFaryab Province, HONG KONG AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE, July 12, 1998) at 2. Although the latter\n\nreport does not expressly state that the petitioner was a TaHban commander, it corroborates that\n\nthe petitioner was at Meymaneh at the time of the Taliban conquest of that city and that Mullah\n\nOmar had placed the petitioner in a position ofleadership during the summer 1998 northern\n\noffensive. fd\n\n          The July 13. 1998 report identifying the petitioner as a Taliban commander at Meymaneh\n\nis also corroborated by media accounts reporting on the Taliban's subsequent push from\n\nMeymaneh to      Mazar-e~Sharif    On August 3, 1998, Agence France Presse reported that Taliban\n\nforces advancing on Mazar-e·Sharif from the west had captured the city of Sheberghan. the\n\n\n26\n          Rashid reports that the majority ofUzbek soldiers captured following the battle for Meymaneh\n          were massacred by the Taliban.

The August 3, 1998 report cited military sources who stated that the assault on\n\nSheberghan had been launched from Meymaneh, which provided \"an invaluable staging and\n\nsupply post for the latest attack:' GE 5 at 2; see also GE 4 at 2 (reporting that in mid-July, the\n\npetitioner was in Meymaneh consolidating his forces in preparation for a push toward Mazar-e-\n\nSharif). The report further stated that this assault was \"led by interior minister Mullah\n\nKhairullah Khairkhwa.\" GE 5 at 2.\n\n        These accounts fmd further corroboration in an August 5, 1998 radio report from the\n\nMoscow Radio Rossii Network, a media outlet with correspondents stationed in the region. GE\n\n6 (Moscow Reports Anti-Taleban Counter-Offensive Under Way, Moscow RADIO Rossn\n\nNETWORK, Aug. 5, 1998) at 1-2. The radio report explained that Taliban forces were advancing\n\ntowards Mazar-e-Sharif from the city of Sheberghan to the west. Id at 1. The report further\n\nstated that\n\n        Khairollah Khairkhwa, interior minister in the Taleban administration, who was\n        advancing toward the town from the west, has halted his troops' advance. He has\n        ordered that the weapons abandoned in large quantities by the alliance soldiers\n        should be collected and the local population disarmed. Explaining his order,\n        Khairkhwa said: We must assure ourselves ofa reliable and calm rear.\n\nld\n        The court notes that the actions attributed to the petitioner in this radio report are highly\n\nconsistent with the descriptions of the petitioner's actions in both the previously-discussed State\n\nDepartment cable and the July 13, 1998 report. See GE 2 at 1; GE 4 at 1. In each of these\n\ninstances, the petitioner is credited with choosing to make strategic delays in his advance\n\n\n\n\n               ,,\n\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ntowards Mazar-e-Sharif. See GE 6 at 1; GE 2 at 1; GE 4 at 1. The statements attributed to the\n\npetitioner in the radio report are also consistent with the petitioner's testimony before the ARB,\n\nduring which he acknowledged overseeing the Taliban's efforts to disarm the citizens of northem\n\nAfghanistan during the Taliban's northern offensive.27 GE 71 at 7.\n\n       Moreover, these accounts of the petitioner's role in the capture of Meymaneh and\n\nSheberghan are consistent with and corroborated by yet another report regarding the Taliban's\n\nconquest of Mazar-e-Sharif on August 8, 1998. On November 6, 1998, Asiaweek, a western\n\nnews magazine, published an article entitled, \"Inside Story: Afghanistan Ethnic Cleansing.\" GE\n\nII at 1. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews with eyewitnesses, the article\n\ndescribed the systematic massacre of the Shiite population of Mazar-e-Sharif following the\n\nTaliban's conquest of that city. See generally id The article specifically noted that \"laurels for\n\nthe conquest of Aug. 8 went to Khairullah Khairkhwah, a Ta1iban mullah who when not busy\n\nmaking war doubles as the regime's 'interior minister.'\" Jd at 3.\n\n       Although the petitioner contends that the author of the Asiaweek article does not specify\n\nthe sources on which he based his reporting, the article expressly states that the account is drawn\n\nfrom \"interviews with survivors ... and documents obtained from international aid\n\norganizations.\" Jd at 1. Furthermore, the only aspect of the Asiaweek article that the petitioner\n\nhas challenged is the portion of the article stating that the petitioner received credit for the\n\nconquest of Mazar-e-Sharif. Indeed, counsel for the petitioner acknowledged that this article\n\nwas a \"fairly reliable document.\" Mar. 28 Tr. at 81, 92. Finally, the Asiaweek account is\n\nconsistent with the overall narrative set forth in the different news reports discussed to this point,\n\n27\n        Even ifthe court were to credit the petitioner's assertion that his role in the Taliban's northern\n        offensive was limited to disanning the local populations conquered by TaJiban forces, see GE 3\n        at 2; GE 71 at 4, this fact would demonstrate that the petitioner was entrusted with significant\n        military-support responsibilities during a time ofongoing conflict and undermine the petitioner's\n        contention that he was merely a civilian bureaucrat with no involvement in any military matters.\n\n                                         vLbd~t,               :\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                 ,   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich document the petitioner's role as a commander of Taliban forces that advanced toward\n\nMazar-e-Sharif from the west, conquering the cities of Meymaneh and Sheberghan along the\n\nway, and entered the city on August 8, 1998. ld.\n\n       The petitioner contends that these media reports are unreliable because they rely on\n\ninformation disseminated by Radio Shariat, a Taliban-controlled radio station. According to\n\nKarzai, Radio Shariat was merely a mouthpiece for the Taliban government that \"did nothing but\n\ndistribute propaganda.\" Mar. 31 Tr. at 152. The purpose of Radio Shariat reports \"was mostly\n\nto boost the morale of [TalibanJ foot soldiers, mostly to tell individuals that we're going to go\n\nprepare to take over the area.\" Id. at 117. Because Radio Shariat is not a reliable source of\n\ninformation, the petitioner argues, aU ofthe articles reporting on the petitioner's role in the\n\nTaliban's northern offensive of 1998 are also unreliable.\n\n       The petitioner's arguments are unpersuasive. As an initial matter, not every media report\n\ndiscussed above relied on information provided by Radio Shariat. The portion of the July 13,\n\n1998 article describing the petitioner's role as the head of forces at Meymaneh appears to have\n\nbeen based on the reporter's conversations with Taliban officials identified in the article, such as\n\nMawlawi Abdurrahman and Mullah Abdul Raj. GE 4 at 1-2. Likewise, there is nothing to\n\nindicate that the Moscow Radio Rossii report or the Asiaweek article relied on Radio Shariat\n\nreports. See generally GE 6; GE 11.\n\n       More fundamentally, even if the principal purpose of Radio Shariat was to distribute\n\npropaganda to boost the morale of Taliban troops, the petitioner has offered no explanation for\n\nwhy the Taliban would have repeatedly and deliberately misidentified him as a commander of\n\nthe Taliban offensive. The petitioner's theory - that all of these reports were disseminated as\n\npart ofa prolonged conspiracy to falsely identify a civilian bureaucrat with no military\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nexperience as a leader of Taliban forces to boost the morale of fighters - is too farfetched,\n\nspeculative and unexplained to be credited by the court.\n\n       The petitioner also conjectures that once he was falsely identified as a military\n\ncommander in one article, this label was picked up and repeated in subsequent news reports\n\nwithout independent corroboration Of verification. This theory, however, is not supported by the\n\nrecord. The articles discussed above report on the petitioner's activities at particular points\n\nduring the summer 1998 offensive. GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 1; GE 11 at 4. The petitioner\n\ndoes not explain how, tor instance, his reported decision to halt his troops' advance to collect\n\nweapons from the local populations, GE 6 at I, could have been propagated from a report that\n\nweeks before, he had been consolidating Taliban forces at Meymaneh, GE 4 at 2. Likewise,\n\nthere is no evidence that the Asiaweek article reporting that the petitioner received \"laurels\" for\n\nthe capture of Mazar-e-Sharif was based on any ofthe previously discussed articles, which all\n\npredate the August 8, 1998 conquest of Mazar-e-Sharif. See generally GE 3, 4, 5,6.\n\n       Finally, the court notes that all of these media accounts of the petitioner's role as a\n\nTaliban commander during the summer 1998 northern offensive - as well as the reports of the\n\npetitioner'S role as a Taliban commander in September 1997 - are corroborated by the statements\n\nof a former Afghan mujahideen commander, Mohammad Akhtiar (ISN 1036). See GE 22 (ISN\n\n1036 SIR (Dec, 27, 2005» at 1-2. Akhtiar was a former colonel or lieutenant colonel in the\n\nAfghan mujahideen during the Soviet occupation. Id at 1. When asked by GTMO interrogators\n\nwhether he knew of any other detainees with ties to the Taliban or al-Qaida, one of the\n\nindividuals that Akhtiar identified was the petitioner. Id After noting that the petitioner had\n\nbeen the Taliban Governor of Herat, Akhtiar stated that \"KhiruIlah once held the position of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                 I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ndivision commander, commander of a military corps, was the Governor of Mazar-e-Sharif and in\n\nparticular was a sub-commander/trusted person of Mullah Omar.\" Id.\n\n       The petitioner does not dispute the government's contention that Akhtiar was a senior\n\nofficer within the Afghan mujahideen and was in a position to know the structure ofthe\n\nTaliban's armed forces. Nor is there any evidence that Akhtiar was coerced into making his\n\nstatements about the petitioner; to the contrary, the interrogation report states that \"the direct\n\napproach orchestrated with the pride and ego up (proper military protocol) and love of country\n\nwere and have been the approaches used\" by interrogators to elicit information from Akhtiar. Id.\n\nThe interrogation report notes that Akhtiar had been deemed truthful and cooperative. ld.\n\n       Although Akhtiar incorrectly identified the petitioner as the \"Governor ofMazar-e-\n\nSharif,\" id. at 1, this statement does not dramatically alter the court's assessment of Akhtiar's\n\nreliability, as it is undisputed that the petitioner possessed administrative authority over\n\nterritories captured during the Taliban's northern offensive in the summer of 1998, including\n\nMazar-e-Sharif. See, e.g., PE 36, Att. Bat 1 (interview statement of former Taliban official\n\nAbdul Salam Rocketi, in which Rocketi states that the petitioner traveled to Mazar-e-Sharif after\n\nthe Taliban's conquest of the city to assist in administrative matters); PE 70 at 3 (petitioner's\n\nARB testimony acknowledging that he went to Mazar-e-Sharifto assist the Taliban forces that\n\ncaptured the city); GE 15 (Taleban in North Tell UN Human Rights Guaranleed, MAZAR-E\n\nSHARIF VOICE OF SHARI' AH RADIO, Aug. 8, 1998) at I (reporting that \"[t]he acting minister of\n\ninternal affairs and coordinator of the northern provinces, esteemed Mowlawi Khayrollah\n\nKhairkhwa, met a delegation ofthe UN Commission for Human Rights\"). The petitioner also\n\nattacks the reliability of Akhtiar's statements by noting that the interrogation report indicates that\n\nAkhtiar was to be shown a picture of the petitioner at his next interrogation, GE 22 at 2, but there\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                 I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nis no indication that such an identification ever took place. Yet Akhtiar stated during the\n\ninterrogation that his statements concerned \"the Herat province Taliban Governor,\" id at 1, and\n\nthere is no dispute that the petitioner was the Governor of Herat, GE 91   1 17.   Thus, there is no\n\nuncertainty that Akhtiar was referring to the petitioner in his statements.\n\n       In assessing the reliability of Akhtiar's statements, the court has considered the fact that\n\nAkhtiar does not expressly identifY the source of his information about the petitioner, does not\n\nprovide detailed allegations about the petitioner, see GE 22 at 1, and had requested psychological\n\ntreatment around the time he made these statements, PE 72 (medical records for ISN 1036) at 1­\n\n4. Nonetheless, in light of the corroboration between Akhtiar's statements and the media reports\n\naddressing the petitioner's role as a Taliban commander, the classified State Department cable\n\nreporting on the petitioner's role as a military commander, the interrogator's assessments of\n\nAkhtiar's truthfulness and the lack of any evidence of undue coercion, the court concludes that\n\nAkhtiar's statements are sufficiently reliable and provide additional support for the government's\n\nallegation that the petitioner served as a Taliban military commander.\n\n       To rebut this evidence, the petitioner relies heavily on a March 2002 interrogation report\n\nin which the interrogator credits the petitioner's claim that he was never a military commander.\n\nPE 25 (ISN 579 SIR (Mar. 14,2002») at 1. The court notes that the interrogator's conclusions\n\nregarding the petitioner appear to have been influenced in significant part by his assessment of\n\nthe petitioner's demeanor - namely, that the petitioner\n\n                                          no signs of deception. See id This assessment was not,\n\nhowever, shared by other interrogators who questioned the petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 that when the\n\npetitioner answers a question, \"it will be minimal at best and require extensive follow up\").\n\nFurthermore, although the interrogation report states that unidentified \"local sources\"\n\ncorroborate the petitioner's claim that he was not a military commander at any battle for Mazar­\n\ne-Sharif, PE 25 at 1-2, as previously discussed, the petitioner has been identified as such a\n\ncommander in a variety of sources, including a classified State Department cable, a publication\n\nthat the petitioner's expert has described as a major scholarly work, the statements of a senior\n\nAfghan mujahideen commander and in numerous contemporaneous media reports. In the court's\n\nview, this single interrogation report does not, by itself or in conjunction with the other evidence\n\noffered by the petitioner, outweigh the evidence establishing the petitioner's role as a military\n\ncommander.\n\n       The petitioner also relies on statements by two former Taliban officials, Mullah Abdul\n\nSalam Rocketi 28 and Wakil Akhmad Motawakil,29 to support his contention that he was never a\n\nmilitary leader. In interviews given to the petitioner's investigator, both men stated that the\n\npetitioner was a civilian administrator and not a military commander.

B at 1. Likewise, Motawakil stated that the\n\npetitioner was not a military official and had always worked as a civilian administrator. PE 43,\n\nAtt. B at 4.\n\n        In the court's view, these statements do not, standing alone or in conjunction with the\n\nother evidence offered by the petitioner, overcome the weight of the evidence establishing the\n\npetitioner's military role. Unlike the news reports, scholarly works and other sources previously\n\ndiscussed, Rocketi and Motawakil provided their statements on the petitioner's behalf expressly\n\nfor use in this litigation. See generally PE 36; PE 43. Karzai himself indicated that Rocketi had\n\na close relationship with the petitioner, having served as a corps commander in Herat during the\n\npetitioner's tenure as the Governor of Herat. Mar. 31 Tr. at 87 (counting Rocketi among the\n\nindividuals who had \"daily and regular contacts with Mullah Khairkhwa\"). Similarly, Karzai\n\ntestified that Motawakil is \"extremely interested in detainee affairs\" and works with Karzai's\n\nCentre for Conflict and Peace Studies, which has acknowledged that it has an interest in seeking\n\nthe petitioner's release. See Mar. 31 Tr. at 125.\n\n        The court also notes that Rocketi and Motawakil provide only broad statements about the\n\npetitioner's role within the Taliban and do not specify the bases for their assertions about the\n\npetitioner's activities in Mazar-e-Sharif. See PE 36, Att. B at 1-2; PE 43, Att. Bat 4-6. These\n\nstatements stand in stark contrast to the detailed accounts contained in the State Department\n\ncable and the media reports addressing the petitioner's role as a military commander, which\n\ncontain contemporaneous accounts ofthe petitioner's activities created long before the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    46\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                I   ,\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n                                              SKCIY!;i'\n\n\npetitioner's apprehension and years before the commencement of this litigation. See generally\n\nGE 2-6, I 1,88.\n\n       Similar considerations limit the weight that the court affords Karzai' s testimony\n\nregarding the petitioner's roles within the Taliban. Although Karzai testified that the petitioner\n\nwas never a Taliban military commander, Mar. 31 Tr. at 115, 119, his testimony does not\n\nindependently corroborate the statements ofRocketi and Motawakil, as Karzai acknowledged\n\nthat he based his conclusions about the petitioner primarily on conversations he had with\n\nindividuals associated with the petitioner, id. at 85-88, including Rocketi, id at 87, and,\n\npresumably, Motawakil, id at 88,109. Furthermore, Karzai candidly acknowledged that he and\n\nhis organization, which is devoted to furthering the peace and stability of Afghanistan, have an\n\nindependent desire to see the petitioner released, testifying that\n\n        Mullah Khairkhwa is one of the individuals who has quite a lot of respect within\n        the Taliban and from so many different communities. His release couldhave a\n        significant impact on the peace process that exists in Afghanistan, particularly in\n        terms of national security and particularly in terms of what he can bring to the\n        table. Many of the senior people still hold him in very high esteem, in high\n        regards, so releasing him would make a very serious statement not only in terms\n        ofthe peace process but also about what the United States represents.\n\nMar. 31 Tr. at 125.\n\n       Thus, Karzai's comments about the petitioner appear to have been motivated by policy\n\nconsiderations unrelated to the evidence at issue here. Although there can be no doubt about the\n\nnobility and importance of the cause championed by Karzai and his organization, considerations\n\nabout the wisdom and utility of releasing the petitioner, which motivated Karzai's testimony, are\n\nmatters for the political branches beyond the purview of this court. See supra Part IV.A.\n\n       Additional considerations also lead the court to question Karzai's conclusions about the\n\npetitioner. For instance, Karzai testified that the petitioner could not have been a military\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                  r   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ncommander during the conquest of Mazar-e-Sharifbecause Ialiban forces were led by Mullah\n\nFaisel, chief of the army for the Taliban, and later by Mullah Dadullah and Mullah Niazi. Mar.\n\n31 Ir. at 115-16. Yet according to Karzai, the Taliban assault on Mazar-e-Sharif involved tens\n\nof thousands of soldiers, id. at 119, a fact that would suggest that the Ialiban must have had\n\nmultiple commanders leading its forces, see, e.g., GE 48 at 100-01 (listing various Ialiban\n\nofficials who acted as commanders during the assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif). The fact that the\n\npetitioner was not the only or most senior Taliban commander involved in the operation does not\n\nmean that he could not have led Taliban fighters during these engagements.\n\n       Karzai also testified that the petitioner could not have served as a commander during the\n\nconquest of Mazar-e-Sharif \"because he has absolutely no military background, never fought in a\n\nbattle, [and] was religiously educated.\" Mar. 31 Ir. at 119. Yet, as previously discussed, the\n\npetitioner did possess prior military experience, having fought with the Afghan mujahideen\n\nduring the Soviet occupation. See supra Part IV.B.2.a. Furthermore, the fact that the petitioner\n\nwas \"religiously educated\" provides little support for Karzai's conclusion; as previously\n\ndiscussed, most of the senior leaders oftbe Taliban, including Mullah Omar, had received\n\nreligious education in madrassas, see GE 48 at 252-55; GE 88 at 21) and, as Karzai himself\n\nacknowledged in bis declaration, most ofthe Taliban's foot soldiers were recruited from'radical\n\nmadrassas, PE 11 0 ~ 9.\n\n       Finally, the court notes that the statements of Karzai, Rocketi and Motawakil all appear to\n\ndraw on the presumption that there existed within the Taliban a strict division between military\n\nand civilian personneL See Mar. 31 Tr. at 118-19 (Karzai' s testimony that military and civilian\n\nresponsibilities were distinct); id at 149 (Karzai's testimony that there was no overlap between\n\ncivilian and military chains of command); PE 36, Att. B at 1 (Rocketi' s testimony that the\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npetitioner \"was a civilian person, not a military commander\"); PE 43, Att. B at 5 (MotawakiI's\n\nstatement that \"[wJe have a structure in Afghanistan that military belongs to Ministry of Defense.\n\nBut [the petitioner] was the interior minister, governor, a spokesman.\").\n\n       This presumption, however, contradicts the weight of the evidence regarding the structure\n\nof the Taliban government. For instance, one scholar notes that\n\n       [0Jne of the most remarkable characteristics of the Taliban leadership is that top\n       government officials often switch from the battlefield to the ministry and back\n       again. each time following the orders from Mullah Omar. In one sense, this\n       produces remarkable flexibility among the Taliban hierarchy as they all act as\n       both administrators and military commanders.\n\nGE 47 (Nasreen Ghufran, The Taliban and the Civil War Entanglement in Afghanistan, 41\n\nASIAN SURV., no. 3, at 462) at 474.\n\n       This observation is echoed by Rashid, who writes:\n\n       Several members of the military Shura are also acting ministers, creating even\n       greater chaos in the Kabul administration. Thus Mullah Mohammed Abbas, the\n       Health Minister, was the second-in-command of the Taliban expeditionary force\n       trapped in the north after the 1997 Mazar defeat. He was then pulled out and sent\n       to Herat to organize another offensive and finally returned to his job as Minister\n       six months later . . \"      Mullah Ehsanullah Ehsan, the Governor of the State\n       Bank[,J commanded an elite force of some 1,000 Kandaharis, ensuring his\n       financial job received little attention before he was killed in Mazar in 1997.\n       Mullah Abdul Razaq, Governor of Herat, who was captured in Mazar in 1997\n       and later freed, has been leading military offensives all over the country since\n       1994. Almost all of the members of the Kandahar and Kabul Shura, except for\n       those with physical disabilities, have acted as military commanders at some time\n       or the other.\n\nGE 48 at 100-01; see also GE 88 at 100 (listing Taliban ministers captured during the Northern\n\nAlliance's May 1997 counteroffensive in Mazar-e-Sharif); GE 5 at 2 (reporting that in early\n\nAugust 1998, Taliban troops \"led by information and culture minister and hardened fighter\n\nMullah Amir Khan Muttaqi - had broken through a frontline around 100 kilometers (62 miles)\n\neast of Mazar-i-Sharif and were continuing their advance\").\n                                       Co 1°\" ,\" \\. ,oof'\n                                       ~ 'v.~) 1~, ';~. . ~.' f\"\n\n\n                                                        49\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               ,,\n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       These sources indicate that senior Taliban officials possessed both military and civilian\n\nresponsibilities and that many Taliban officials with civilian titles functioned as military\n\ncommanders during the Taliban's various assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif. See GE 5 at 2; GE 48 at\n\n100-01. The court credits these reports, which identify specific Taliban leaders who functioned\n\nas dual military and civilian officials, over the broad assertions ofKarzai, Rocketi and\n\nMotawakil, and finds that they provide additional support for the conclusion that the petitioner\n\npossessed military responsibilities while he held the post ofActing Interior Minster. See GE 11\n\nat 3 (\"Laurels for the conquest of Aug. 8 went to Khairullah Khairkhwah, a Taliban mullah who\n\nwhen not busy making war doubles as the regime's 'interior minister.''').\n\n      iv. Summary of the Evidence Regarding the Petitioner's Role at Mazar-e-Sharif\n\n       In swnmary, the weight of the evidence supports the government's contention that the\n\npetitioner served as a military commander during the Taliban's assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif in\n\nSeptember 1997 and the summer of 1998. It is far from clear that these findings, standing alone,\n\nwould establish the lawfulness of the petitioner's detention. Nonetheless, together with the\n\nevidence of the petitioner's involvement with the Afghan mujahideen, see supra Part IV.B.2.a,\n\nand the petitioner's membership on the TaIiban's Supreme Shura, see infra Part IV.B.2.c, they\n\nundermine the petitioner's claim that he was merely a civilian official shielded from the\n\nTaliban's military affairs and support the notion, as elaborated in the following sections, that the\n\npetitioner remained integrally involved in the Taliban's military forces before and after the U.s.­\n\nled invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n                   c. The Petitioner's Position on the Taliban's Supreme Shura\n\n       As the Taliban rose to power, they instituted a ruling structure organized in three\n\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nCommander of the Faithful). Mullah Omar. Id Below Mullah Omar was the ten-member\n\nSupreme Shura. which was based in Kandahar. reported directly to Mullah Omar and, according\n\nto Karzai, was ''It]he highest decision making body of the Taliban.\" Id; accord GE 48 at 250.\n\nSubordinate to the Supreme Shura were two sub-councils, the Military Shura and the Kabul\n\nShura. PE 110\"19,21.\n\n       Ample evidence establishes that the petitioner served as a member of the Taliban's\n\nSupreme Shura. GE 48 at 250; GE 88 at 44; Mar. 31 Tr. at 135. It is equally clear that the\n\nSupreme Shura possessed authority over military matters. Karzai noted that the Military Shura, a\n\nbody \"in charge of devising strategies and implementing tactical decisions,\" reported to the\n\nSupreme Shura. PE 110,21. The Kabul Shura, whose responsibilities included \"the Kabul\n\nfront against the Northern Alliance,\" also reported to the Supreme Shura. Id, 22 (noting that\n\n\"(i]mportant issues\" faced by the Kabul Shura \"were conveyed to the Supreme Shura for\n\ndecisions to be made\"). Indeed, Karzai stated that \"[i]n addition to the I 0 permanent members,\n\n[Supreme] Shura meetings a1so involved military commanders, tribal leaders\" and others. ld,\n\n20.\n\n       The petitioner notes that after 1996, governmental power was concentrated in the hands\n\nofMullah Omar, who held ultimate decision-making authority over all matters. GE 48 at 102;\n\nPE 110, 18. Nonetheless, even after the Supreme Shura's decision-making authority waned, it\n\ncontinued to have a \"consultative function.\" PE 110 , 18. It is therefore unsurprising that,\n\naccording to Rashid, \"[aJlmost all of the members ofthe Kandahar and Kabul Shura, except for\n\nthose with physical disabilities, have acted as military commanders at some time or the other.\"\n\nGE 48 at 100-01.\n\n\n\n\n                                                51 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                            8El!MT\n\n       The fact that the petitioner was appointed to serve on the Supreme Shura, which reported\n\ndirectly to Mul1ah Omar, possessed responsibility over military matters and was comprised\n\nalmost exclusively of military commanders, cuts against the petitioner's assertion that he was a\n\ncivilian bureaucrat sequestered from the Taliban's military matters. The petitioner's membership\n\nin the Supreme Shura is also consistent with the evidence that the petitioner obtained military\n\nexperience with the Afghan mujahideen, led Taliban forces during the Taliban's northern\n\noffensives in 1997 and 1998 and, as discussed below, continued to wield military responsibilities\n\nthrough the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n     d. \tThe Petitioner's Military Responsibilities as Governor of Herat Leading Up to\n                                Operation Enduring Freedom\n\n       On October 27, 1999, Mullah Omar appointed the petitioner to serve as Governor of\n\nHerat, a post that he held at the time of the U.S.-led invasion in October 2001. GE 91   ~   17; GE\n\n43 at 2. The petitioner has stated that as Governor of Herat, he was a mere civilian\n\nadministrator, collecting taxes, distributing revenues to the Taliban's Minister of Finance and\n\nresolving local disputes, GE 71 at 5; PE 12 (ISN 579 MFR (May 30, 2002» at I, and maintains\n\nthat he had no involvement with any military matters, GE 70 at 2; PE 12 at 1.\n\n       The evidence does not support the petitioner's assertions. The court notes that in a recent\n\nstatement on its \"successful administrative poHcy,\" describing the structure, positions and\n\npolicies of a prospective Taliban government, the Taliban explained that each province of\n\nAfghanistan \"is an independent unit with a commander called the Governor\" who is \"directly\n\nresponsible for the Supreme Command of that province and directs its military, civilian, fmancial\n\nand legal affairs.\" See GE 49 (Ikram Maiwandi, The Islamic Emirate ofAfghanistan and Its\n\nSuccessful Administrative Policy, AL-SOMOODMAGAZINE, Jan. 27, 201 I) at 2. Thus, under the\n\n\n\n\n                                                52\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n             __ I   •\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                              SF.iCHT\n\n\nTaliban's model for governance, the governor ofa province serves as its highest civilian and\n\nmilitary authority. See id.\n\n       This governance model is consistent with the fact that nearly all senior Taliban leaders\n\nheld both civilian and military positions, see, e.g., GE 48 at 100-0 I, as well as the fact that the\n\nindividual who preceded the petitioner as Governor of Herat, Mullah Abdul Razaq, was a senior\n\nmilitary commander who was captured at Mazar-e-Sharif in 1997 and, after his release, led\n\nmilitary offensives all over the country, GE 48 at 100; GE 88 at 100. The facts support the\n\nnotion that the petitioner had both military and civilian responsibilities as the Governor of Herat.\n\n       Indeed, since his capture by Pakistani authorities in early 2002, the petitioner has\n\ndisplayed a level of detailed knowledge about military installations in Herat that would suggest\n\nhe was no mere tax collector. For example, during one interrogation, the petitioner stated that\n\n        the Taliban's 2 largest divisions were located in the region of Herat. One of the\n        divisions w[asJ located in 4-5 km East ofthe Governors Office Building in Herat.\n        This division consisted mainly of equipment that was left behind by the Russians.\n        Approx. 30-40 tanks, (some not operational), all types of artillery, weaponry,\n        \"lots\" of shoulder rockets displayed on the tarmac[] for everyone to see how\n        strong the Taliban was.\n\nGE 46 (ISN 579 MFR (Sept. 25, 2003)) at 1.\n\n        According to the petitioner, this division possessed three jets, one cargo plane and two\n\nhelicopters and was commanded by Abdul Salam Rocketi. Id. at 1-2. The petitioner also stated\n\nthat the other Taliban division was located at the Sheendand Airbase and was commanded by\n\nPeer Aagha. Id. at 2. The petitioner explained that \"this division had the same type of\n\nequipment as the first division ... and would not go into great detail other than saying the\n\nSheendand Division had an airstrip.\" [d. The petitioner further noted that \"the Taliban Divisions\n\nare not the same as the way we (U.S. Army) have our division set.uplestablished\" and that all of\n\nthe trainers for these divisions were Taliban commanders who had served in previous wars. fd\n\n\n\n                                                  53 \n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       In other interrogations, the petitioner has described the following military facilities\n\nlocated in Herat:\n\n   • \t Qoli Urdu: The petitioner has described Qoli Urdu as \"a large, run-down\n       installation, north of Herat.\" GE 43 at 2; see also GE 45 at 1 (interrogation report\n       in which the petitioner describes Qoli Urdu as \"a very big military installation\n       just north of Herat\"). The petitioner has explained that his deputy, Abdul Hanan,\n       renovated part of this facility with funding from Mullah Omar. PE 30 (UR 6 034\n       0898 02) at 4.\n\n\n\n\n   • \t Qoai Char (\"Force 4\"): The petitioner stated that \"an installation called Force 4\n       had 30 to 40 operational, Soviet-era tanks and 100 broken tanks.

Allied\n        aircraft flew too high and the Taliban figured since they were V.S. made, U.S.\n        planes would have appropriate countermeasures for them. Although the Stingers\n        were prized, the Taliban had no interest in Soviet made SA-7's or \"blue pipes\" as\n        they were called.

Rather, this knowledge, coupled with the\n\npetitioner's detailed knowledge about the locations, personnel and weapons of various military\n\nbases in Herat and the fact that the petitioner's predecessor was a seasoned military commander,\n\nsupport the notion that Taliban provincial governors like the petitioner possessed authority over\n\nboth military and civilian matters related to their district.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   55 \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       The evidence also indicates that the petitioner's purportedly civilian duties - in particular,\n\nthe disbursement of Taliban funds     had, at least on occasion, a direct nexus to Taliban military\n\n\n\n\n       The court's ability to assess the reliability this report is hindered by the report's failure to\n\nexpressly identify its source.

For instance, during a March 2002 interrogation, the\n\npetitioner stated that at the October 2001 meeting,\n\n       the Iranian delegation offered to purchase for the Taliban hand~held Russian\n       manufactured, anti-aircraft missiles, which are superior to Stinger missiles. The\n       Iranians claimed these missiles could fire to a higher elevation than a Stinger\n       missile The Iranians referred to the missiJe as a SAM haft (Field Comment - the\n       word haft means the number seven in the Persian-Afghan language). The\n       Iranians refused to give more information on the missiles until the Taliban\n       delegation proved they had money to buy the missiles. The Iranians als~ said\n       they would buy other military equipment for the Taliban, but would not identifY\n       the type of equipment until the Taliban delegation proved they had enough\n       money .... The Iranians also offered to open the [IranJ/[Afghanistan] border for\n       Arabs traveling to and from [AfghanistanJ. The Iranians would let any Arab past\n       their border checkpoints entering [Afghanistan].\n\nGE 56 at 2.\n\n       The petitioner provided a highly consistent account during a May 2002 interrogation,\n\nstating that \"Iranian officials offered to broker a peace between the Taliban and the Northern\n\nAlliance so Muslims could unite against the United States. The Iranian officials said that Iran\n\ncould track all movements by the United States.\" GE 57 at 1. According to the petitioner,\n\n\"Iranian officials also offered to sell the Taliban SAM-7 missiles and other [unidentified]\n\nweapons if the Taliban could prove that they had the money to buy them.

The petitioner also noted that the Iranians indicated their ability to monitor the\n\nactivities ofthe U.S. military. ld According to the petitioner, \"[tJhe Iranians had told [him] that\n\n'We are following them (the U.S.) everywhere. Khairkhwa was unsure if they meant that they\n\nhad satellite capability, but thought the Iranians were speaking figuratively rather than literally\n\nregarding intelligence collection.\" Id\n\n       The petitioner also acknowledged during his CSRT hearing that he was present at the\n\nOctober 2001 meeting during which Iran pledged to assist the Taliban in their war with the\n\nUnited States, GE 70 at 2, and testified during his ARB hearing that at the October 2001\n\nmeeting, \"[t]hc Iranians offered to buy weapons for us because we were on restriction and could\n\nnot buy them. That is the truth.\" GE 71 at 8.\n\n       These statements, given at different times during the petitioner's detention, are highly\n\nconsistent with one another, and there is no evidence that these statements are unreliable because\n\nthey were elicited through undue coercion or duress. Accordingly, the court considers these\n\nstatements reliable evidence that the petitioner was part of the Taliban delegation that met with\n\nIranian officials to discuss Iran's offer to provide the Taliban with military aid on the eve of the\n\nU.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\n                                                 '(' r'    r   \"r\n                                                 63\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n            ,. -, \t \" .\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                              SI!3€M'f\n\n\n       The petitioner has contended that it is implausible that the Iranians would have offered to\n\nprovide military assistance to the Taliban because Iran considered the Taliban an arch-enemy\n\nand allied itself with the United States and the Northern Alliance during Operation Enduring\n\nFreedom. See, e.g., Mar. 31 Tr. at 100-01;PE     110~~25-30;    PE lllA ~~ 10-16; PE 75 at 246­\n\n54; PE 78 at 2-3. The court finds these arguments unpersuasive. As an initial matter, the\n\npetitioner's theory - that Iran could not have offered any military assistance to the Taliban\n\nbecause Iran and the Taliban were enemies - does not adequately account for the complexity of\n\ninternational relationships in that region. As noted in an article cited by the petitioner, \"Iran has\n\nplayed all sides of the Afghan conflict,\" having provided military support to different, competing\n\ngroups vying for control of Afghanistan before and after the fall ofthe Taliban. PE 75 at 2-3.\n\nIndeed, even as the United States and Iran ostensibly allied themselves during Operation\n\nEnduring Freedom, \"Iran also sent large stocks of weapons to Herat and [Afghan warlord Ismail]\n\nKhan, which culminated in the United States firing a cruise missile at Khan's Headquarters,\n\nkilling eighteen of his men in January 2002.\" Id. at 3.\n\n       As noted in another article cited by the petitioner, former CIA Director George Tenet\n\ndeclared in early 2002 that Iran's initial signs of cooperation had \"eclipsed\" and that \"while\n\nIran's officials express a shared interest in a stable government in Afghanistan, its security forces\n\nappear bent on countering the US presence. This seeming contradiction in behavior reflects\n\ndeep-seated suspicions among Tehran's clerics that the US is committed to encircling and\n\noverthrowing them.\" PE 76 at 248. Yet another article cited by the petitioner states that \"[i]n\n\nearly 2007, Washington reported that Iran had started to supply sophisticated arms to the Taliban\n\nin western Afghanistan,\" even as it \"increased political and military support to the former\n\nNorthern Alliance.\" PE 78 at 3. Although Karzai stated in his declaration that evidence of\n\n                                                       r ' .'\n\n                                                  64\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n                                             SECM'f\n\nIranian support for the Taliban reflects a recent shift in Iranian policy towards the Taliban, PE\n\n110129, these reports indicate Iran did not possess a unitary attitude towards the U.S.-led\n\ninvasion of Afghanistan at the time of Operation Enduring Freedom and underscores the\n\ndifficulty of presuming that Iran would not have offered military support to the Taliban simply\n\nbecause of their history of animosity.\n\n       Moreover, the petitioner himself is the source of the information regarding the October\n\n2001 meeting between the Taliban delegation and senior Iranian officials. As previously noted,\n\nthe petitioner has provided multiple, consistent accounts of Iran's offer to provide the Taliban\n\nwith military assistance. The petitioner has offered no explanation for why he would have\n\nfabricated this information during his interrogations. Indeed, in his proposed [mdings of fact, the\n\npetitioner acknowledges that he attended the October 2001 meeting with the Iranian delegation,\n\nthough he does not expressly concede that the purpose of the meeting was Iran's offer to provide\n\nmilitary support to the Taliban. See Petr's Proposed Findings of Fact, 292.\n\n       The petitioner also contends his mere attendance at the October 2001 meeting does not\n\nsupport his detention because he was simply there to provide security for the Taliban delegation.\n\nGE 71 at 2, 7. The court disagrees. First, even if the petitioner's role was limited to providing\n\nsecurity for the Taliban delegation, that fact would itself significantly undercut the petitioner's\n\ncontention that he was simply a civilian bureaucrat and would demonstrate that he possessed\n\ncommand authority over Taliban forces on the eve of the U.S.-led invasion and was entrusted\n\nwith providing security services in support of a military-related mission. At any rate, the fact\n\nthat the petitioner was included in the substantive discussions, see, e.g., GE 70 at 2-3, coupled\n\nwith his demonstrated knowledge about missile systems, his military oversight responsibilities as\n\nthe Governor of Herat and his close ties to Mullah Omar, see infra Part IV.B.3, suggest that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 65\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npetitioner attended the October 2001 meeting not simply as the Taliban's chief security officer,\n\nbut as a Taliban representative.\n\n       Finally, the petitioner contends that his attendance at the October 2001 meeting does not\n\nsupport the lawfulness of his detention because there is no evidence that the Iranian offer was\n\never accepted. The court notes at the outset that the petitioner has provided differing accounts of\n\nthe Taliban's response to the Iranian offer. See GE 60 at 3 (\"Ultimately, the offer was\n\nrejected.\"); GE 71 at 8 (\"When the delegation went back to Kandahar the bombing started, so the\n\nproposition fell apart. \"); GE 57 at 2 (\"[The petitioner] fled the area shortly after the meeting and\n\ndoes not know if the offer was ever given to Omar.\"). At any rate, the significance of this\n\nevidence does not turn on whether the Taliban accepted the Iranian offer, but rather, lies in the\n\nfact that Taliban leaders in Kandahar designated the petitioner to represent the Taliban in high-\n\nlevel discussions with senior Iranian officials regarding Iran's offer to provide military assistance\n\nto the Taliban in preparation for the imminent U.S.-led invasion. The petitioner's selection to\n\nattend the meeting demonstrates that he was entrusted with significant military-related\n\nresponsibilities at the time of the outbreak of hostilities with the United States and strongly\n\nindicates that he was part of Taliban forces at that time.32\n\n       The petitioner's role in the October 2001 meeting is consistent with evidence that after\n\nthe commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, the petitioner continued to operate within\n\nthe Taliban's formal command structure and provide support for Taliban military forces.\n\n\n\n\n32\n        The government has argued that the petitioner attended a second meeting with Iranian officials in\n        November 200 I regarding Iran's offer to provide military assistance to the Taliban. See GE 45 at\n        3; GE 61 at 1-2. It appears, however, that the November 2001 meeting referred to in these\n        exhibits and the October 200 I meeting discussed above are one and the same. See GE 45 at 3;\n        GE 61 at 1-2.\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nwith the prior reports regarding the petitioner's role in providing financial support for Taliban\n\ntroops and security forces, see GE 46 at 2                as well as the petitioner's prior\n\nacknowledgment that Herat contained the Taliban's two largest military divisions and multiple\n\nmilitary insta1lations,                      43 at 2; GE 46 at I. Accordingly, the court concludes\n\nthat this intelligence report is sufficiently reliable for the court's consideration and further\n\ndemonstrates that the petitioner continued to operate within the Taliban's formal command\n\nstructure and provide support to Taliban troops after the outset of hostilities with U.S. coalition\n\nforces.\n\n          The petitioner's involvement with the Taliban's military apparatus continued even as\n\nU.S. coalition forces pushed the Taliban out ofnorthern Afghanistan. Although the petitioner\n\nhas provided contradictory accounts of his retreat from Herat, the petitioner has stated that in\n\nearly November 2001, as the bombs began to fall in Herat province, he traveled in a convoy of\n\nten vehicles to Arghastan, a village in the eastern part of Kandahar province.

According to the petitioner, the vehicles in his convoy \"were full of\n\nweapons.\" Id The petitioner stated that he \"turned the weapons over to a sherif in Arghastan\n\nand then called Hamid «Karzai» to discuss turning himselfin.\" Id\n\n       Although the petitioner would later deny that the vehicles in the convoy contained\n\nweapons, see GE 71 at 6, the court sees no reason to doubt the admission made during the May\n\n2002 interrogation. There is no evidence that this statement was elicited through undue coercion\n\nor duress, and the statement was made shortly after the events at issue. See GE 18 at 1.\n\nAccordingly, the court credits the petitioner's initial admission that he fled to Kandahar in a\n\nconvoy comprised of ten vehicles that were full of weapons.\n\n       The fact that the petitioner had access to a large volume of weapons demonstrates that he\n\ncontinued to wield military-type authority even after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nFurthermore, although the petitioner contends that he turned the weapons over to an official in\n\nArghastan affiliated with the post-Taliban government, this claim is not plausible, as the Taliban\n\ndid not lose control of Kandahar until December 7,2001, weeks after the petitioner fled Herat for\n\nArghastan. GE 91 ~ 9. AccordinglY, if, as the petitioner has stated, he surrendered the weapons\n\nin his convoy to a local \"sherif' in Arghastan, it would have been to a local Taliban official.\n\n       Accordingly, reliable evidence demonstrates that the petitioner was appointed to\n\nrepresent the Taliban in discussions with high-level Iranian officials regarding Iran's offer to\n\nprovide the Taliban military assistance for use against U.S. coalition forces. Reliable evidence\n\nalso indicates that after the U.s.-led invasion, the petitioner continued to provide material\n\nsupport to TaHban forces stationed in Herat and facilitated their movement to other areas in\n\nAfghanistan, implementing orders issued by Taliban leadership in Kandahar. Finally, the\n\npetitioner has admitted that in early November 2001, he retreated from Herat to the Taliban­\n\n                                                               \".·,c'. \"\n                                           ,   .. 1   ;\n                                          ~,~)= ~~~ ~\n                                                          68\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n                                             SELMI\n\n\nstronghold of Kandahar in a convoy of vehicles full of weapons, and that he delivered those\n\nweapons to officials in Kandahar.\n\n       These findings are consistent with the evidence establishing the petitioner's long history\n\nof involvement with the Taliban's military affairs. Like most senior Taliban leaders, the\n\npetitioner obtained military experience fighting with the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet\n\noccupation. After joining the Taliban in 1994, the petitioner was entrusted with military\n\nresponsibilities, sitting on the Taliban's Supreme Shura, which had oversight over military\n\naffairs and serving as a commander of Taliban fighters during the Taliban's northern offensives\n\nin 1997 and 1998. The petitioner remained intimately involved in the Taliban's military affairs\n\neven after being appointed Governor of Herat, as demonstrated by his detailed knowledge about\n\nmilitary installations and weapons systems, his facilitation of funding for Taliban military and\n\nintelligence forces as well as his role as a Taliban representative during discussions with Iranian\n\nofficials in January 2000 regarding military and security-related matters.\n\n       Together, this evidence establishes that the petitioner was part of the Taliban forces\n\nengaged in hostilities with U.S.-led coalition forces in late 2001. Accordingly, so long as the\n\nevidence indicates that the petitioner remained a part ofthose forces and had not disassociated\n\nhimself from the Taliban by the time of his capture in early 2002, the petitioner's detention is\n\nlawful under the AUMF. Before turning to the issue of disassociation, however, the court briefly\n\naddresses the evidence concerning the petitioner's ties to Mullah Omar, which the government\n\ncontends provides additional support for the lawfulness of his detention.\n\n                       3. The Petitioner Had Close Ties to Mullah Omar\n\n       Since his apprehension in early 2002, the petitioner has sought to portray himself as a\n\nreluctant Taliban leader. The petitioner has stated that he \"was compeUed to work for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 69 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               ,   I\n\f                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nTaliban because they were in power at the time and, if one didn't, the TaIiban could 'create\n\nproblems' for someone.\" GE 4S at 1. The petitioner has suggested that he joined the Taliban as\n\na matter of happenstance, stating that while trying to secure ajob in Spin Boldak in 1994, \"one\n\nday, an unknown Taliban member asked him to speak with a London, England BBC reporter on\n\nthe phone regarding Taliban military positions. The Taliban were so impressed with his\n\nspeaking abilities they offered him the position of 'wayand,' or spokesman for the Taliban.\" GE\n\n20 at 1. He has characterized his appointment as Governor of Herat as a move that came out of\n\nthe blue. Id. at 2 (\"Taliban official recommended he be appointed Governor of Herat,\n\n[Afghanistan], for unknown reasons.\"). In fact, during various interrogations, the petitioner\n\ndenied holding leadership positions that he now concedes that he possessed. Compare OE 71 at\n\n3 (\"I was not the Taliban spokesman.\") and GE 43 at 1 (the petitioner's statement that \"he was\n\noften mistaken as the Minister of the Interior for the Taliban because he lived at the Ministry and\n\nspoke to the press often\") with Petr's Proposed Findings of Fact 1f 6 (\"After his return to\n\nAfghanistan in 1994, petitioner was appointed spokesperson for the Taliban government for the\n\nPashto language because of his proven abilities in providing information to the media.\"); GE 91\n\n~.   17 (stipulating that the petitioner became the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister in 1996 or\n\n1997).\n\n          Despite these efforts to portray himself as a reluctant, marginal Taliban figure, the\n\nevidence indicates that the petitioner was, in reality, a prominent and influential leader within the\n\nTaliban. For instance, as previously discussed, the petitioner quickly rose to the Taliban's\n\nhighest ranks, becoming a member of the Supreme Shura, \"the most powerful ruling body\" in the\n\nTaliban government, OE 48 at 250, which reported directly to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, PE\n\n1101f 19.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   70\n\n                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                  I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n                                              SECRET\n\n\n       The evidence also indicates that after the petitioner began to serve on the Supreme Shura,\n\n\n\n\nstatements of this mullah are corroborated by veteran Afghan mujahideen commander Akhtiar,\n\nwho identified the petitioner as \"a sub-commander/trusted person of Mullah Omar.\" GE 22 at 1.\n\n       These statements are further corroborated by a November 1999 article published in the\n\nPakistani newspaper, The News, reporting on Mullah Omar's decision to reshuffle the Taliban\n\nleadership. GE 40 (Editorial: Taleban ReshzifJle, THE NEWS, Nov. 1, 1999) at 1. This reshuffle\n\nresulted in the petitioner's appointment as Governor ofHe rat. Id The article stated that\n\n\"[l]oyalists like Mulla Khairullah Khairkhwa, Mulla Abdur Razzaq ... and Mulla Said\n\nMohammad Haqqani were aU rewarded with the choicest jobs.\" Id.\n\n       The petitioner's status as one of Mullah Omar's trusted associates is also born out by the\n\nfact that Mullah Omar repeatedly appointed the petitioner to serve in prominent and sensitive\n\nposts. In July 1998, Mullah Omar appointed the petitioner to oversee the areas captured during\n\nthe Taliban's northern offensive. GE 3 at 2. In August 1998, when Iran threatened war with\n\nAfghanistan after the Taliban murdered eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist, Mullah\n\nOmar publicly announced that the petitioner would lead a commission to investigate the\n\nmurders. 33 GE 13 (Bodies ofRemaining 2 Iranians Found in Afghanistan, THE NEWS, Oct. 7,\n\n1998) at 1; GE 46 at 2.

According to the petitioner,\n\nMullah Omar's decision to appoint him Governor of Herat was effectively a demotion and\n\nsignaled the fact that the petitioner no longer held Mullah Omar's trust. Mar. 31 Tr. at 113.\n\n       The weight of the evidence does not support the petitioner's contention. Herat was a\n\nstrategically important province at the time ofthe petitioner's appointment as governor; it\n\nbordered Iran, which had recently threatened war with the Taliban and possessed historically\n\nclose ties with the population of Herat. PE 75 at 3; PE 76 at 244-45. Herat also contained\n\nnumerous Taliban military installations, including its two largest divisions, as well as the\n\nheadquarters of Taliban intelligence. GE 46 at I. Indeed, as previously noted, one\n\ncontemporaneous media report characterized the petitioner's new position one of the \"choicest\n\njobs\" in the Taliban government, awarded to the petitioner because he was a Mullah Omar\n\nloyalist. GE 40 at 1.\n\n       Moreover, reliable evidence indicates that the petitioner remained within Mullah Omar's\n\ninner circle after his appointment as Governor of Herat, as U.S. coalition forces began their\n\nassault on Taliban forces. Specifically, the court credits an October 13,2001 intelligence report\n\nciting information provided by a                                                               SeeGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                 72\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n27 (IIR 6 931 0020 02) at 1.\n\n                               that after a U.S. cruise missile had hit Mullah Omar's vehicle one\n\nweek earlier during air strikes in Kandahar,\n\n\n\n\nspecifically notes that this officer                                      The reliability of the\n\nreport is also buttressed by the level of detail contained in the officer's account, including\n\nspecific infonnation regarding the locations ofTatiban commanders that has been independently\n\ncorroborated. See id at 2 (reporting that Mullah Rocketi, the \"corps commander of Jalalabad[,]\n\nmoves between that city and north Kabul\"); PE 70 at 139 (listing Rocketi as the \"fonner corps\n\ncommander of Jalalabad\"). Lastly, the report of a missile strike occurring the week before\n\nOctober 13,2001 is consistent with the timeline of Operation Enduring Freedom, which\n\n\"commenced on 7 October 2001 with coalition air strikes on al-Qaida and Taliban targets\n\nthroughout Afghanistan.\" GE 77 at 2. In light ofthese indices of reliability, the court credits the\n\nreport's account that after a U.S. coalition airstrike in early October 2001, Mullah Omar limited\n\nhis circle of contacts to a handful of his most trusted and important \"commanders,\" including the\n\npetitioner.\n\n        In sum, the court finds implausible the petitioner's contention that he was a reluctant\n\nTaliban member. Rather, the weight of the evidence indicates that the petitioner had close ties\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nwith Mullah Dmar and that he remained one of Mullah Omar's most trusted associates before\n\nand after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. This finding is consistent with\n\nthe court's earlier conclusions that the petitioner was a key Taliban leader entrusted with military\n\nresponsibilities, which he carried out both before and after the commencement of Operation\n\nEnduring Freedom. See supra Part IV.B.2. Moreover, the fact that the petitioner was one of\n\nMullah Omar's trusted associates undermines the petitioner's contention that he was a simple\n\ncivilian bureaucrat shielded from the Taliban's military activities, and provides a useful starting\n\npoint for assessing the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated himself from the Taliban\n\nby the time of his capture in early 2002.\n\n     4. Tbe Petitioner Remained Part oftbe Taliban at the Time of His Apprehension\n\n       As previously discussed, it is not enough for the government to show simply that the\n\npetitioner was, at one time, a member of the Taliban, al-Qaida or associated forces; to be\n\nlawfully detained, the petitioner must have been \"part of' those forces at the time of his capture.\n\nSee Salah;, 625 F.3d at 751; Gherebi, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 71. «A petitioner who may once have\n\nbeen part of al-Qaida or the Taliban can show that he was no longer part of such an entity at the\n\ntime of capture by showing that he took affirmative actions to abandon his membership.\" Khalif\n\nv.

The petitioner has stated that he met with a group of high-\n\nlevel Taliban officials one month before the surrender of Kandahar to discuss the peaceful\n\nsurrender of the city. PE 34 at 1. According to the petitioner, the meeting was held without\n\nMullah Omar's consent and the officials present were those \"who favored a bloodless, peaceful\n                                                      t '.      ;~    , , :(\n                                                      \\!

GE 45 at 3; see also GE 18 at I (interrogation report in which the petitioner\n\nstated that he contacted Hamid Karzai to discuss surrendering after the United States began\n\nbombing Afghanistan); GE 70 at 4 (petitioner's CSRT testimony in which he states that he\n\ncontacted Hamid Karzai \"when Herat was taken over\"); GE 91 ~ 7 (stipUlating that the Taliban\n\nlost control of Herat on or about November 13, 2001). According to the petitioner, this evidence\n\ndemonstrates that he had disassociated himself from the Taliban before he was captured by\n\nPakistani authorities in late-January or early-February 2002. See GE 91   ~   18.\n\n       The court disagrees. Even if the petitioner did participate in a secret meeting with high-\n\nlevel Taliban leaders regarding the surrender of Kandahar, there is no evidence that any\n\nparticipant at that meeting surrendered to U.S. coalition forces, publicly or privately broke with\n\nMullah Omar or took any action signaling an intent to end hostilities with U.S. coalition forces.\n\nIndeed, in the month before the surrender of Kandahar, there was fierce fighting between U.S.\n\ncoalition and Taliban forces for control ofthe city until it fell on December 7, 2001. GE 77 at 4.\n\n       Likewise, even if the petitioner contacted Hamid Karzai in mid-November 2001 to\n\ndiscuss the possibility of surrender, the petitioner did not tum himself in, but was instead\n\ncaptured in Chaman, Pakistan approximately three months later. GE 91 ~ 18. The petitioner has\n\nprovided no credible explanation for what he was doing or what steps he had taken to\n\ndisassociate himself from the Taliban during the months after he allegedly contacted Hamid\n\nKarzai to discuss the possibility of surrender.\n\n\n\n\n                                     ~,,t,   1;''';''<:'''   ,,~.:\n\n\n\n                                     . .i     <,._ f,.~ __, ~\n                                                                     75\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       The petitioner has stated that by the time of his capture, he had resolved to cooperate with\n\nU.S. coalition forces and that he traveled to Chama.n, Pakistan to obtain treatment for a stomach\n\nailment before turning himself in. GE 45 at 3; GE 70 at 4; GE 71 at 9. The petitioner, however,\n\nwas not captured at a medical office in Chaman. Rather, it is undisputed that the petitioner was\n\ncaptured at the Pakistani residence of senior Taliban official Abdul Manan Niazi. GE 91 , 18.\n\nAs previously discussed, Niazi was a fonner Taliban military commander and Governor of\n\nKabul, who had personally overseen the massacre of thousands of Shiites in the city of Mazar-e-\n\nSharifin August 1998 and was part of the Taliban delegation that traveled to Iran in October\n\n200 I to discuss Iran's offer to provide military assistance to the Taliban. See supra Part\n\nIV.B.2.a. The fact that the petitioner was captured at the home of a hardlinc TaUban military\n\ncommander greatly undennines the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated himself\n\nfrom the Taliban prior to his apprehension by Pakistani authorities. See Al-Bihani v. Ohama,\n\n2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107590, at *33-34 (D.D.C. Sept. 22, 2010) (noting that the fact that the\n\npetitioner continued to associate with al-Qaida or Taliban operatives undermined the petitioner's\n\nargument that he had cut his ties with al-Qaida prior to his apprehension); cf Uthman v.

Mar. 29,2011) (observing that evidence that the petitioner\n\nwas captured in the company of Taliban and al~Qaida fighters in the vicinity of Tora Bora\n\nsupported the conclusion that he was lawfully detained).\n\n       The petitioner's claim that he had resolved to cooperate with U.S. coalition forces prior to\n\nhis capture is also undermined by the evasiveness he exhibited during his discussions with U.S.\n\ninterrogators. According to the government, the earliest known interrogation of the petitioner\n\noccurred                          approximately 3:00 p.m. See Govt's Proposed Findings of Fact\n\n& Conclusions of Law at 82. The interrogator who conducted this inquiry reported that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 76\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   ,\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n                                                      S!!ClmT\n\n\npetitioner \"attempted to evade questions\" and noted that \"caution should be used when dealing\n\nwith the detainee as he attempts to draw in the interrogator and 'tap dance' around questions.\"\n\nGE 64 (ISN 579 Handnote (Feb. 7,2002) at 1.\n\n       The petitioner's refusal to provide full cooperation has been noted by other interrogators,\n\nwho, as previously noted, have described the petitioner as cunning and evasive. See\n\nPE 34 at 1. The resistance exhibited by the petitioner during these interrogations is not, in the\n\ncourt's view, consistent with the petitioner's claim that he had decided to turn himself in and\n\ncooperate with U.S. coalition forces before he was apprehended in Pakistan.\n\n       In short, the court does not credit the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated\n\nhimself from the Taliban prior to his capture in Chaman, Pakistan. Rather, the weight of the\n\nevidence, especially the fact that he was captured at the home of a senior Taliban official,\n\nindicates that the petitioner remained part ofTaliban forces at the time of his capture.\n\n                            C. Viewing the Totality of the Evidence\n\n       There is no dispute about the basic contours of the petitioner's life. The parties agree that\n\nthe petitioner joined the TaHban in 1994 and became a spokesman and district administrator in\n\nSpin Boldak. He rose through the Taliban ranks and served as a member of the Taliban Supreme\n\nShura, the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister and the Governor of Herat. The petitioner retreated\n\nfrom Herat during Operation Enduring Freedom and that he was ultimately captured by Pakistani\n\nauthorities in Chaman, Pakistan in early 2002.\n\n       The parties have, however, offered two starkly different narratives regarding the\n\npetitioner's tenure with the Taliban. The petitioner contends that he was simply a civilian\n\nbureaucrat who had no involvement with the Taliban's military forces, lost Mullah Omar's trust\n\nover time and eventually broke with him and the Taliban during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\n                                     :t~'~I'\n                                      ,- f\n                                               r\"~\"   ./....   ~\n\n\n\n\n                                                               77\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               ,   .\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the government, the petitioner was an experienced military leader who wielded\n\nmilitary authority before and after the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, was a\n\nmember of Mullah Omar's inner circle and remained part of the Taliban even after the time of\n\nhis capture in early 2002.\n\n       Viewed in its totality, the evidence provides more support for the government's narrative.\n\nThe court concludes that the petitioner, like most other senior Taliban leaders, fought with the\n\nAfghan mujahideen in the 19805, and, like other senior Taliban leaders with civilian titles,\n\nparticipated in the Taliban's military efforts to seize control of Afghanistan, serving as a\n\ncommander ofTaliban fighters during the Taliban's assaults on Mazar-e-Sharifin 1997 and\n\n1998. Even after his appointment as Governor of Herat in 1999, the petitioner remained\n\nintegrally involved in the Taliban's military forces, operating within the Taliban's formal\n\ncommand structure and facilitating the movement of Taliban troops both before and after the\n\ncommencement of Operation Enduring Freedom. Moreover, on the eve of Operation Enduring\n\nFreedom, the petitioner was dispatched to Iran by Taliban leaders in Kandahar to discuss Iran's\n\noffer to provide military assistance to the Taliban in anticipation ofthe imminent U.S.-led\n\ninvasion of Afghanistan.\n\n       Throughout his tenure in the Taliban, the petitioner remained a prominent leader and a\n\nclose ally of Mul1ah Omar. The petitioner's ties to Mullah Omar persisted even after a U.S.\n\ncruise missile struck Mullah Omar's vehicle in the early days of Operation Enduring Freedom,\n\nand MuJlah Omar limited his contacts to his most trusted lieutenants, including the petitioner.\n\n       Although the petitioner reached out to Hamid Karzai to discuss the possibility of\n\nsurrender after the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, he never turned himself in\n\nand was captured at the home of a senior Taliban official. The evidence, therefore, does not\n\n\n\n\n                                                 78\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n                                             SECRE'f\n\nsupport the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated himself from the Taliban by the time\n\nof his capture.\n\n       Based on these considerations, the court concludes that the government has established\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner was part ofTaliban forces engaged in\n\nhostilities against the United States at the time of his capture. The petitioner is therefore lawfuJly\n\ndetained and his petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be denied.\n\n\n\n                                        v.

INTRODUCTION\n\n       This matter comes before the court on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by\n\nKhairulla Said WaH Khairkhwa (ISN 579) (\"the petitioner\"), an Afghan national detained at the\n\nUnited States Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (\"GTMO\"). The government contends\n\nthat the petitioner, a former senior Taliban official, is lawfully detained because he was part of\n\nTaliban forces and purposefully and materially supported such forces in hostilities against the\n\nUnited States. The petitioner maintains that his detention is unlawful because he was merely a\n\ncivilian administrator in the Taliban government with no involvement in the Taliban's military\n\noperations, and because he had disassociated himself from the Taliban by the time ofhis capture.\n\n       In March 2011, the court held a merits hearing to assess the lawfulness of the petitioner's\n\ndetention. During the eourse of that hearing, the parties introduced dozens of exhibits from a\n\n\n\n\n                                             SECREl\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                               SECItE'f\n\nvariety of classified and public sources, including media reports, scholarly works, interrogation\n\nreports and declarations from intelligence analysts. The court also received live testimony and\n\ndeclarations from subject matter experts offered by the petitioner. At the conclusion of the\n\nhearing, both parties submitted detailed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nencapsulating and amplifying the evidence and argument presented during the merits hearing,)\n\n       Having carefully considered the parties' extensive presentations, the court reaches the\n\nfollowing findings. The petitioner was, without question, a senior member of the Taliban both\n\nbefore and after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. The petitioner served as\n\na Taliban spokesperson, the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister, the Taliban Governor of Kabul\n\nand a member of the Taliban's highest governing body, the Supreme Shura. The petitioner was a\n\nclose associate ofTaliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, who appointed him Governor of the\n\nprovince of Herat in 1999. The petitioner held this office at the time the Taliban government feU\n\nto U.S. coalition forces in late 2001.\n\n       Although the petitioner contends that he had no military responsibilities in any of his\n\nposts within the Taliban, the record belies that contention. The petitioner has repeatedly\n\nadmitted that after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, he served as a member of a\n\nTaliban envoy that met clandestinely with senior Iranian officials to discuss Iran's offer to\n\nprovide the Taliban with weapons and other military support in anticipation of imminent\n\nhostilities with U.S. coalition forces. The petitioner has also exhibited a detailed knowledge\n\nabout sensitive military-related matters, such as the ]ocations, personnel and resources ofTaliban\n\nmilitary installations, the relative capabilities of different weapons systems and the locations of\n\n\n       The government has objected to the petitioner's reliance on eleven documents that were not made\n       a part of the record, but are nevertheless cited in the petitioner's proposed findings of facts and\n       conclusions of law. See generally Govt.'s Opp. To Petr's Reliance on Materials Outside the\n       Record. The government's objection is overruled.\n\n\n                                           SECRET \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nweapons caches. Furthermore, the petitioner operated within the Taliban's fonnal command\n\nstructure, providing material support to Taliban fighters both before and after the outset of\n\nhostilities with U.s. coalition forces. These facts are consistent with the TaHban's governance\n\nmodel, in which nearly all senior Taliban officials were tasked with both civilian and miHtary\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n        Despite the petitioner's efforts to portray himself as a reluctant, marginal figure within\n\nthe Taliban, the record indicates that the petitioner rose to the highest level of the Taliban and\n\nhad close ties to Mullah Omar, who repeatedly appointed the petitioner to sensitive, high-profile\n\npositions. Indeed, even after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, the petitioner remained\n\nwithin Mullah Omar's inner circle, despite the fact that Mullah Omar had Hmited his contacts to\n\nonly his most trusted commanders.\n\n        The petitioner remained part of Taliban forces at the time of his capture in early 2002.\n\nAlthough the petitioner contacted individuals allied with the United States to discuss the\n\npossibility of surrendering himself to U.S. coalition forces, he never turned himself in and was\n\nultimately captured at the home of a senior Taliban military commander.\n\n        In sum, based on a totality of the evidence, the court concludes that the government has\n\nproven by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner was part of Taliban forces at the\n\ntime of his capture. The petitioner is therefore lawfully detained and his petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus must be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8EyRET \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n                                          II.

Procedural History\n\n           In June 2008, the Supreme Court issued its ruling in Boumediene v. Bush, 12& S.

See generally Pet.\n\n       Although the Supreme Court did not specify what procedures the district courts were to\n\nemploy in resolving habeas petitions fi1ed by GTMO detainees, it did emphasize that the\n\n\"detainees in these cases are entitled to a prompt habeas corpus hearing.\" Boumediene, 128 S.\n\nCt. at 2275. Toward that end, this court and other judges in this district agreed to consolidate\n\ntheir cases before Judge Hogan for the purpose of adopting common procedures for the GTMO\n\ndetainee litigation. See Minute Order (Oct. 29,2008). On November 6, 2008, Judge Hogan\n\nissued a Case Management Order (\"CMO\") to govern these proceedings, which he amended on\n\nDecember 16, 2008. See generally Am. CMO (Dec. 16, 2008). This court adopted the\n\nprovisions of the amended CMO, subject to modifications set forth in an Omnibus Order issued\n\non April 23, 2009. See generally Omnibus Order (Apr. 23, 2009).\n\n       The government filed its factual return for the petitioner in December 2008. See\n\ngenerally Factual Return. Following an extensive period ofdiscovery, the petitioner filed\n\nhis traverse in December 2009. 6 See generally Traverse. In April 2010, the parties filed cross-\n\nmotions for judgment on the record. See generally Govt's Mot. for J. on the R.; Petr's Cross-\n\nMot. for J. on the R. The court denied the parties' cross-motions after concluding that there were\n\ngenuine issues of material fact in dispute, and scheduled a merits hearing to begin in November\n\n\n\n        The court granted the government's motion for leave to amend the factual return in September\n        2010, Mem.

Framework for Assessing the Evidence\n\n       In assessing whether the government has shown that the petitioner is lawfully detained,\n\nthe court \"must evaluate the raw evidence, finding it to be sufficiently reliable and sufficiently\n\nprobative to demonstrate the truth of the asserted proposition with the requisite degree of\n\ncertainty.\" Bensayah v.

Reliance on Ex Parte Information\n\n       During the course of this litigation, the government has filed a number of motions for\n\nleave to provide the petitioner with redacted versions of certain documents that are subject to the\n\nautomatic disclosure provisions of the CMO.

The court also heard extensive argument from the parties regarding Williams's\n\nqualifications to offer expert testimony in this case, though it declined to rule on the matter\n\nduring the hearing.\n\n        In the following sections, the court explains in greater detail the basis for its ruling on\n\nKarzai's qualifications and assesses the expert qualifications of Williams. The court begins by\n\nbriefly recounting the general principles governing the qualification of expert witnesses.\n\n                  1.

Meister, 267\n\nF.3d at 1127 n.9.\n\n       Rule 702 does not specify any particular means for qualifying an expert, requiring only\n\nthat the witness possess the \"knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" necessary to\n\n\"assist\" the trier of fact.

As the Supreme Court stated in Daubert, the trial\n\ncourt must determine whether the proposed expert possesses \"a reliable basis in the knowledge\n\nand experience of [the relevant] discipline.\" 509 U.S. at 592. In considering whether this\n\nstandard is met, courts may consider the factors articulated in Daubert, such as (1) whether the\n\nexpert's technique or theory can be or has been tested; (2) whether the technique or theory has\n\nbeen subject to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error of the\n\ntechnique or theory when applied; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards and controls;\n\nand (5) whether the technique or theory has been generally accepted in the scientific community.\n\nId\n\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                                 tJJ!Cft'l!';)\n\n       The Supreme Court has, however, noted that the Daubert factors are not exclusive and\n\nmay not apply in all cases.

Id. at\n\n90. In effect, the government argued, the petitioner was attempting to introduce hearsay\n\nevidence in the guise of expert testimony. Id. at 91.\n\n       The court overruled the government's objection based on the following considerations:\n\nhaving authored a master's thesis on the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaida, as well\n\nas numerous scholarly works on the Taliban and Afghanistan, Karzai had amassed over a decade\n\nofexperience conducting research on issues related to the Taliban and Afghanistan by the time\n\nhe began researching the petitioner in 2006. Id at 44-49,86. Accordingly, Karzai plainly\n\npossessed the training and experience necessary to conduct research into the petitioner, a\n\nprominent and senior member of the Taliban government.\n\n       Indeed, it would appear that in a manner consistent with his training and experience,\n\nKarzai conducted a systematic inquiry into the petitioner. Karzai testified that he formed his\n\nopinions about the petitioner's background and posts within the Taliban by interviewing\n\nnumerous people associated with him, including his family, those who worked with him in the\n\nTaliban government on a daily basis and current senior Afghan government officials. Id. at 83­\n\n85. He also consulted primary and secondary sources, such as local Afghan publications, for\n\ninformation regarding the petitioner's role within the Taliban. Id at 84. Karzai testified that he\n\nsought out a variety of individuals with firsthand knowledge about the petitioner, speaking not\n\nonly with individuals from Taliban-dominated southern Afghanistan, but also with individuals\n\nfrom both the Mazar-e-Sharif region in the north and Herat province in western Afghanistan. ld\n\nat 89. Moreover, Karzai attempted to verify the information he obtained from any source by\n\nseeking corroboration through other sources. [d. at 86-87.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                              SltCRR'f'\n\n\n       The government did not explain why Karzai's reliance on information that he obtained\n\nfrom these interviews precludes him from offering expert testimony, particularly in light of his\n\nefforts to cross-reference and corroborate this information. 1O Although the government\n\nsuggested that the rigor of Karzai' s inquiry was undermined by his persona) desire to see the\n\npetitioner freed, Mar. 31 Tr. at 90-91, in the court's view, this factor is relevant to the weight\n\nafforded to Karzai's testimony, not his expertise.\n\n       Accordingly, based on Karzai's knowledge, training and experience regarding the\n\nTaliban and his efforts to research the petitioner's background and roles within the Taliban, the\n\ncourt concluded during the merits hearing that Karzai was qualified to offer expert testimony on\n\nthe petitioner's background and posts within the Taliban.\n\n                                         3.

He has a doctoral degree in Central\n\nAsian History, as well as a master's degree in Russian History and Central Eurasian Studies. Id\n\nWilliams has authored more than seventy articles on war and terrorism in Central Eurasia. ld\n\nHe has testified as an expert in other GTMO proceedings. See, e.g., Khan, 741 F.

See generally PE lIlA. The government does not dispute Williams's\n\nqualifications to offer testimony on subjects one and four. Mar. 31 Tr. at 6. The government\n\nasserts, however, that Williams lacks the qualifications necessary to offer expert testimony on\n\nsubjects two and three, both of which concern the relationship between the Taliban and Iran. ld\n\nMore specifically, the government contends that Williams has little expertise on Afghanistan or\n\nthe Taliban, having focused the majority of his schoJarJy endeavors on the Russian Caucasus and\n\nTurkey, and that he has no specialized education or training on Iran. Id at 6-21. The\n\ngovernment also points to mistakes and inconsistencies in testimony offered by Williams in other\n\nGTMO proceedings as evidence ofhis lack of expertise. Id at 22-30.\n\n       The court disagrees with the government's assessment of Williams's expertise. The\n\ngovernment itself has previously relied on Williams as an expert on the Taliban. Williams\n\nauthored a book published in 2001 by U.S. Army Publications entitled \"Afghanistan 101: A\n\nGuide to the Afghan Theater of Operations,\" GE 100, 5, and has lectured on the Taliban and\n\nAfghanistan at the U.S. Special Operations Command at Macdill Air Force Base (\"The Role of\n\nForeign Fighters in the Taliban Insurgency\"), Air Force Special Operations Command at\n\nHurlburt Airfield (\"Waging Counter-Insurgency in Afghanistan 1842-2008\"), the Joint\n\nInformation Operations Warfare Command at Lackland Air Force Base (\"Background on Islam,\n\nSuicide Terrorism and Jihad in the Middle East'') and the Central Intelligence Agency's Counter\n\nTerrorist Center (\"Profiling Afghan Suicide Bombers\"), GE lilB (Curriculum Vitae of Brian\n\nWilliams) at 9-10.

He has also authored articles discussing Afghanistan in the age of Taliban-rule\n\nthat have been published in scholarly journals, 11 as well as policy journals and other\n               12\ncollections.        PE 111 B at 3-7. Furthennore, Williams has taught at least one course covering\n\nmodem Afghan history, including the period of the Taliban, titled \"Empires and Invasions: A\n\nHistory of Afghanistan from Genghis Khan to the War on Terror.\" GE 95 at 1.\n\n       Given his demonstrated scholarship on the history of the Taliban, as well as the\n\ngovernment's own reliance on him as an expert on matters related to the Taliban, it is clear that\n\nWilliams possesses the specialized knowledge needed to offer expert opinion testimony on the\n\nTaliban and Afghanistan. Indeed, as previously noted, the government has conceded that\n\nWilliams is qualified to offer expert testimony about the battle for Mazar-e-8harif during the rise\n\nof the Taliban and about the presence of al-Qaida bases in Herat province during the Taliban's\n\nrule over Afghanistan. See Mar. 31 Tr. at 6.\n\n       Such expertise could not be obtained without developing a specialized knowledge of the\n\nTaliban's relationships with its regional neighbors, including Iran. It is well-established that\n\nIran, which shares a 400-mile border with Afghanistan, played a central role in Afghan affairs\n\nduring the TaJiban's rise to power, providing substantial military support to the Northern\n\nAlliance and other groups in their struggle for control of Afghanistan.

ANALYSIS\n\n                   A. The Scope of the Government's Detention Authority\n\n       The government's authority to detain individuals at GTMO derives from the\n\nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\"), which provides that\n\n       the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against\n       those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,\n       committed, or aided the terrorist attack that occurred on September 11, 2001, or\n       harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of\n       international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations,\n       or persons.\n\nPub. L. No. 107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001).\n\n       This Circuit has delineated two categories of persons detainable under the AUMF: (1)\n\nindividuals who are \"part of' forces associated with al-Qaida or the Taliban and (2) individuals\n\nwho purposefully and materially supported such forces in hostilities against U.S. coalition forces.\n\nAl Bihani, 590 F 3d at 872; see also id at 874 (noting that \"both prongs are valid criteria that are\n\nindependently sufficient to satisfy the standard\"). The burden rests with the government to\n\ndemonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the detainee falls within one of these\n\n\n\n                                                 20 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                               SEeH\"\n\ncategories of detainable persons. See Awad v. Obama, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10 (D.C.

Accordingly, the district courts must determine\n\nwhether an individual is \"part of\" al-Qaida or associated forces on a \"case-by-case basis\"\n\nemploying a \"functional rather than a formal approach and by focusing upon the actions of the\n\nindividual in relation to the organization.\" Id. \"That an individual operates within al Qaeda's\n\nformal command structure is surely sufficient but is not necessary to show that he is 'part of the\n\norganization.\" Id.; see also Awad, 608 F.3d at 11 (\"Ifthe government can establish by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence that a detainee was part of the 'command structure' of al Qaeda,\n\nthis satisfies the requirement to show that he was 'part of al Qaeda. But there are ways other\n\nthan making a 'command structure' showing to prove that a detainee is 'part of' al Qaeda.\"). On\n\nthe other hand, \"the purely independent conduct of a freelancer is not enough\" to show that an\n\nindividual is detainable as \"part of' of those enemy forces. Bensayah, 610 F.3d at 725; see also\n\nSalahi v. Obama, 625 FJd 745, 752 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (noting that \"the government's failure to\n\nprove that an individual was acting under orders from al-Qaida may be relevant to the question\n\nof whether the individual was 'part of the organization when captured\").\n\n\n13\n        Nevertheless, the Circuit has expressly left open the question of whether a lower evidentiary\n        standard might be constitutionally permissible.

The government must prove, however, that the petitioner was \"part of' the Taliban, al-Qaida\n\nor associated forces at the time of his capture to demonstrate that his detention is lawful under\n\nthe first prong of the standard. See Salahi, 625 F.3d at 751 (observing that \"the relevant inquiry\n\nis whether [the petitioner] was 'part of al-Qaida when captured\"); Gherebi v. Obama, 609 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 43, 71 (D.D.C. 2009).\n\n       Few courts have delved at length into the ''purposeful and material support\" prong of the\n\ndetention standard. It is nonetheless clear that as with the \"part of' prong of the detention\n\nstandard, the inquiry into whether an individual has purposefully and materially supported\n\nhostilities against U.S. coalition forces requires a fact-specific assessment focusing on the actions\n\nof the individual in relation to the organization. See Al-Bihani, 590 F.3d at 873 (noting that even\n\nifthe detainee could prove that he was a civiHan \"contractor\" and was not a formal member of\n\nthe Taliban, the services that he provided to Taliban fighters engaged in hostilities against U.S.\n\ncoalition forces, such as cooking for the unit and carrying a brigade-issued weapon, would render\n\nhim detainable under the support prong of the detention standard).\n\n       In assessing whether the government has met its burden under either prong of the\n\ndetention standard, the court may not view each piece of evidence in isolation, but must consider\n\nthe totality ofthe evidence. See AI-Adahi v. Obama, 613 FJd 1102, 1105-06 (D.C. Cir. 2010).\n\nEven if no individual piece of evidence would by itselfjustifY the petitioner's detention, the\n\nevidence may, when considered as a whole and in context, nonetheless demand the conclusion\n\nthat the petitioner was more likely than not \"part of' the Taliban or al-Qaida or that the petitioner\n\npurposefully and materially supported such forces.

The Petitioner Was a Senior Taliban Official\n\n        In many of the GTMO habeas cases litigated since Boumediene, the central question\n\nbefore the court has been whether the detainee knowingly associated himself with the Taliban,\n\nal-Qaida or related enemy forces. To resolve this question, courts have commonly sifted through\n\nevidence of the detainee's presence at training camps and safchouses and assessed the\n\nplausibility of the detainee's claim that he had no intention ofjoining forces hostile to the United\n\nStates. See, e.g., Alsabri, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">576064</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9-32 (analyzing evidence that the detainee had\n\nstayed at al-Qaida and Taliban-affiliated guesthouses and training camps and evaluating the\n\ndetainee's assertion that he traveled from Yemen to Afghanistan to find work and a wife);\n\nKandari v.

Supp. 2d 11,27-29 (D.D.C. 2010) (assessing the detainee's\n\nassertion that he traveled to Pakistan and then to Afghanistan to obtain religious training and\n\nperform charitable work); Almerfedi v.

Here, there is no dispute about the\n\npetitioner's long history as a member of the Taliban. As previously noted, the petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                                 23 \n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nacknowledges that he began working for the TaJiban in 1994 and that he served as the Taliban's\n\ndistrict administrator in Spin Boldak and spokesperson to media outlets such as the BBC and\n\nVoice of America. GE 91      ~   15; GE 20 at 1-2; GE 45 at 1; GE 70 at 1-2; GE 71 at 3; GE 110,\n\n48. It is undisputed that the petitioner was appointed Governor of Kabul in 1996 and, shortly\n\nthereafter, became the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister. GE 91                                 ~   16; GE 110 ~ 50. It is also\n\nundisputed that in October 1999, the petitioner was appointed Governor of Herat province, a\n\nposition that he held through the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom.

In short, the parties agree that the petitioner was not only functionally part of the Taliban,\n\nbut that he was, in fact, a fonnally-recognized, high-ranking Taliban official at the time of the\n\nU.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n       As a result, the question before the court is not whether the petitioner ever knowingly\n\nassociated himself with the Taliban, but instead, whether the nature and duration of that\n\nassociation renders him lawfully detained under the AUMF. The government contends that the\n\npetitioner is lawfully detained because he was deeply involved in the Taliban's military\n\noperations throughout his tenure with the Taliban, had close ties to Mullah Omar and remained\n\npart of the Taliban at the time of his capture in early 2002.14 The petitioner, in turn, asserts that\n\nalthough he was a senior Taliban official, he had no involvement with the Taliban's military\n\n\n\n\n14\n        During the merits hearing, the government raised a host of additional allegations against the\n        petitioner, including allegations that the petitioner had ties to Usama bin Ladin, harbored a1­\n        Qaida operatives in Herat during his tenure as Governor of Herat and commanded a Taliban\n        garrison at Mazar-e-Sharif during Operation Enduring Freedom. The court declines to address\n        these allegations because the evidence analyzed below is sufficient to establish the lawfulness of\n        the petitioner'S detention.

The court considers these matters in turn.\n\n             2. The Petitioner's Involvement With Talihan Military Operations\n\n        Throughout this litigation, the petitioner's chief contention has been that he was merely a\n\ncivilian administrator who had no involvement with the Taliban's military operations.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, the evidence purporting to show that he had obtained military\n\ntraining and experience and possessed military responsibilities is inherently flawed and\n\nunreJiable. The petitioner also relies on the statements of expert witnesses and former Taliban\n\nofficials who claim that the petitioner was merely a civilian bureaucrat with no military\n\nresponsibilities. The petitioner asserts that as a purely civilian official, he was not part of\n\nTaliban forces, did not purposefully and materially support the Taliban in hostilities against U.S.\n\ncoalition forces, and, as a result, is not lawfully detained.\n\n        The government does not dispute that a purely civiHan official who had no connection to\n\nany military activities would not be subject to detention under the AUMF. According to the\n\ngovernment, however, the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that like almost all Taliban\n\nleaders, the petitioner obtained military training and experience fighting with the Afghan\n\nmujahideen in the 1980s, and remained deeply involved in the Taliban's military operations until\n\nthe time of his capture in early 2002. The court assesses this evidence in the following sections.\n\n         a.

More specifically, Rashid reports\n\nthat the petitioner was a graduate of the Dar-ul Uioom Haqqania madrassa, a member of\n\nMohammed Nabi Mohammedi's Harakat Mujahideen party and a former mujahideen\n\ncommander during the Soviet occupation.

Karzai similarly testified that Rashid possesses an understanding of\n\nAfghanistan that is superior to that of most other purported experts and noted that Rashid's\n\naccount of the history of the Taliban was more reliable than other works because it resulted from\n\nRashid's field work in Afghanistan.

For instance, Rashid's\n\nreport that Mullah Omar received a madrassa education in Kandahar and fought with the Afghan\n\nmujahideen faction led by Yunas Khalis, GE 48 at 252, is corroborated by Karzai, who has also\n\nwritten articles about Mullah Omar, Mar. 31 Ir. at 79, and stated in his declaration that Mullah\n\nOmar was \"educated in various madrassas in Kandahar,\" PE           Ito, 40, and had \"participated in\nthe Jihad against the Soviet and Afghanistan communist government under the faction led by\n\nYunas Khalis,\" id '42. Similarly, Rashid's report that Mullah Qalamuddin, the Taliban's Head\n\nof Religious Police, was educated at the Dar-w Uloom Haqqania madrassa is corroborated by a\n\nSeptember 2001 article about the Dar-ul Uloom Haqqania madrassa in the The Guardian\n\nnewspaper.

I 7\n\n       Indeed, much of Rashid' s account of the petitioner's background is independently\n\ncorroborated by other evidence in the record. For instance, Rashid reports that the petitioner was\n\nborn in Kandahar province, is a Ourrani Pashtun and is a member of the Popalzai tribe, GE 48 at\n\n253, all of which are facts to which the parties have stipulated.

This inconsistency\n       does not call into question the reliability of Rashid's reporting, as the petitioner's own expert has\n       corroborated Rashid's account of Mullah Omar's education at madrassas in Kandahar.

Although the petitioner\n\n suggests that he was in his teens for most ofthe Soviet occupation and lacked any forma]\n\n military training, he has not explained how either fact precludes the possibility that he fought\n\n with the Afghan mujahideen or rose through its ranks. Likewise, although the petitioner objects\n\n by stating that Rashid has not identified the sources of his information regarding the petitioner's\n\n background, the petitioner's own experts have acknowledged that Rashid's reporting is based on\n\n his field work in Afghanistan and is highly authoritative.

Accordingly, the weight of the evidence indicates that the petitioner did\n\n fight with the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviets.\n\n        That the petitioner fought with the Afghan mujahideen, at a time when those forces were\n\n aJlied with the United States and against the Soviet Union, see PE 67 at 197, hardly establishes\n\n the lawfulness ofhis detention. This finding does, however, serve as an important starting point\n\n for assessing the petitioner's role in the Taliban, for it establishes that the petitioner possessed at\n\n least some military experience by the time he joined the Taliban in 1994, and begins to unravel\n\n the petitioner's assertion that he was merely a civilian bureaucrat with no connection to the\n\n Taliban's military forces.\n\n\n\n\n 19\n         Karzai's testimony about the petitioner is assessed in greater detail later in the following section.\n         See infra Part IV.B.2.b.ii.\n\n\n\n\n                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                  I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n\n\n             h.

See id As an initial matter, the petitioner has not suggested that the\n\ncable inaccurately summarizes Husseini's statements. Indeed, the author of the cable appears to\n\nhave taken great pains to provide a detailed account of the discussions between Husseini and the\n\nU.S. political officer, including what purport to be direct quotations from Husseini. ld at 1-3.\n\n       There is also no dispute that Husseini was a political officer and a representative ofthe\n\nTaliban at the time of the September 17, 1997 meeting and that his statements were given\n\nvoluntarily as part of an official diplomatic exchange between the Taliban and the United States.\n\nSee Petr's Proposed Findings of Pact ,,37-39. Husseini not only identified the petitioner as a\n\ncommander of Taliban forces, but also provided a detailed account ofthe petitioner's activities\n\nas a commander, such as his strategic decision to wait for reinforcements before continuing his\n\npush towards Mazar-e-Sharif, and expressly identified the source of his account - nameJy,\n\nreports sent from the field by the petitioner to Taliban leaders in Kandahar. GE 2 at 1.\n\n       Furthermore, many of the details contained in Husseini's account of the fighting around\n\nMazar-e-Sharif are corroborated by other sources in the record. See GE 88 at 103-04 (reporting\n\nthat Hizb-i-Islami forces assisted in the Taliban September 1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif); GE\n\n48 at 229 (noting \"heavy fighting again near Mazar\" on September 18, 1997).

Petr's Proposed Findings of Fact~,-r 38-39.\n\nThe petitioner, however, has not offered any explanation regarding what political advantage\n\ncould conceivably have been gained by falsely identifying the petitioner as a commander of the\n\nTaliban forces. See id. While speculation about Husseini's motivations might call into question\n\nthe accuracy of his characterizations ofthe strength of the Taliban's forces and the imminence of\n\ntheir victory, the petitioner has not attempted to explain how the specter of political motivations\n\ncasts doubt on his identification of the petitioner as a Taliban military commander.\n\n       Moreover, Husseini's statements regarding the petitioner's involvement in the September\n\n1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif are corroborated by a separate account of that campaign authored\n\nby journalist and diplomat Kamal Matinuddin. See GE 88 at 1. In The Taliban Phenomenon,\n\nMatinuddin writes that in September 1997, Truiban forces\n\n        took control of the bypass running towards the river port of Hairatan on the\n        Oxus, thus threatening Mazar-e-Sharif from the rear. Omar had predicted that it\n        would be only a matter of time before the Taliban scored further military\n        victories, and he was not far wrong as, led by Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, they\n        entered Mazar-e-Sharif a day later with the support of Majeed Bacha, Bashir\n        Khan, and Jumma Khan Hamdar, all of whom belonged to the Hikmetyar faction\n        of Hizb-e-Islami.\n\nGE 88 at 103-04.\n\n       Although the petitioner suggests that Matinuddin's account does not independently\n\ncorroborate the State Department cable because Matinuddin may have relied on the same source\n\ncited in the State Department cable, the petitioner has offered nothing to substantiate that theory.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 35 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                             UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nSee GE 88 at 103-04~ GE 2 at 1. In fact, although Matinuddin and Husseini both identify the\n\npetitioner as a commander of Taliban forces and note that Hizb-i-Islami fighters participated in\n\nthe assault, the two accounts otherwise possess few overlapping details. Compare GE 88 at 104\n\n(identifying the specific Hizb-i-Islami leaders who participated in the Taliban's September 1997\n\nassault, a detail not included in the State Department cable) with GE 2 at I (providing\n\ninformation about tactical decisions and the locations offorces involved in the assault, details not\n\npresent in Matinuddin's account).\n\n       The reliability of Matinuddin's account is further supported by the fact that the author is\n\nan experienced military officer, diplomat23 and journalist who has edited and written numerous\n\nworks on Afghanistan. GE 88 at 1. Although the petitioner complains that Matinuddin lacked\n\nfirsthand knowledge of the events at issue and does not identify the sources on which he based\n\nhis account, the petitioner's own subject matter expert lists Matinuddin's The Taliban\n\nPhenomenon as one ofthe most significant \"major scholarly works\" on the rise of the Taliban. 24\n\nPE lilA' 5. Indeed, the petitioner can only point to minor purported inconsistencies between\n\nMatinuddin's account and Rashid's account of the TaIiban's September 1997 offensive,25 and\n\ndoes not challenge any core aspect of Matinuddin's reporting, other than his identification of the\n\n\n23 \t\n       Matinuddin represented Pakistan in several diplomatic capacities, including as its ambassador to\n       Thailand. GE 88 at 1.\n24 \t\n       In fact, Williams's insistence that the petitioner could not have served as a Taliban commander\n\n       not mentioned as a military commander in any these \"major scholarly works.\" PE I 1]     ,9\n       during any of the assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif stems from his erroneous beJief that the petitioner is\n\n       (\"Simply put, had there been a Mullah Khairkhwa leading troops on the northern front from 1997\n       to 1998[,] one of these scholars ... would have recorded his name somewhere.\").\n\n       The petitioner notes that according to Matinuddin, the Taliban captured the town ofTashkurgan\n       on September 9, 1997, GE 88 at 103-04, while Rashid reports that the Taliban captured the same\n       town on September 7, 1997, PE 67 at 62. This minor inconsistency does not, in the court's view,\n       significantly undennine the reliabiJity of either account. Indeed, Matinuddin's and Rashid's\n       accounts of the September 1997 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif are highly consistent with one\n       another. See GE 88 at 103-04; PE 67 at 62-63, 229.\n\n                                           C\n                                           vLI\n                                               f   f; r ~\";:....,..\"r\n                                                                    ;\n\n                             UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n            .. _ .J..l ...\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npetitioner as a commander of Taliban forces. Based on these considerations, the court concludes\n\nthat Matinuddin's and Husseini's highly consistent accounts of the September 1997 assault on\n\nMazar-e-Sharifare accurate ~nd reliable evidence of the petitioner's role as a Taliban\n\ncommander,\n\n       Furthermore, as discussed below, the petitioner's role as a commander of Taliban forces\n\nin September 1997 is also corroborated by the statements of a former senior officer in the Afghan\n\nmujahideen, who expressly identified the petitioner as a former Taliban military commander,\n\nGE 22 at 1; infra Part IV.B.2.b.iii. The court also notes that the petitioner's role as a commander\n\nof Taliban forces in September 1997 is consistent with the fact that he possessed military\n\nexperience from his participation in the Afghan jihad, see supra Part IV.B.2.a, as well as the\n\nevidence indicating that the petitioner participated in the August 1998 assault on Mazar-e-Sharif,\n\nsee infra Part IV,B.2.b.iiL Thus, the weight ofthe evidence supports the conclusion that the\n\npetitioner was a military commander who led Taliban forces during the Taliban's assault on\n\nMazar-e-Sharif in September 1997.\n\n          iii. The Petitioner's Role in the August 1998 Conquest of Mazar-e-Sharif\n\n       Numerous sources have also reported that after the Taliban's failed September 1997\n\nassault on Mazar-e-Sharif, the petitioner remained a military commander, directing Taliban\n\nfighters during the Taliban's northern offensive in the summer of 1998. One of the earliest of\n\nthese sources is an article published by a western media outlet on July 13, 1998, which reported\n\non the Taliban's fresh bid to seize the northern territories remaining outside their control. GE 4\n\n(Stefan Smith, Taliban Make Major Advance in Northern Afghanistan, AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE,\n\nJuly 13, 1998) at 1.

The article further\n\nreported that Taliban forces were poised to push northward toward the cities of Sherberghan and\n\nMazar-e-Sharif. ld According the article, \"Tali ban officials were tight-lipped over the militia's\n\nplans, and said the student movement was busy consolidating their positions, with battle-veteran\n\nand interior minister Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa heading the operation.\" fd at 2 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          This July 13,1998 report is consistent with Rashid's account that on July 12, 1998,\n\nTaliban forces captured Meymaneh and seized\" 100 tanks and vehicles and some 800 Uzbek\n\nsoldiers.\" GE 48 at 72. The report is also consistent with a July 12, 1998 news report stating\n\nthat Taliban soldiers had conquered the city of Meymaneh and that Mullah Omar had appointed\n\n\"(Interior minister) Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa to oversee the captured areas and to ensure the\n\nhundreds of prisoners taken are well treated.,,26 GE 3 (Taleban Claim Sweep ofAfghanistan's\n\nFaryab Province, HONG KONG AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE, July 12, 1998) at 2.

The radio report explained that Taliban forces were advancing\n\ntowards Mazar-e-Sharif from the city of Sheberghan to the west. Id at 1. The report further\n\nstated that\n\n        Khairollah Khairkhwa, interior minister in the Taleban administration, who was\n        advancing toward the town from the west, has halted his troops' advance. He has\n        ordered that the weapons abandoned in large quantities by the alliance soldiers\n        should be collected and the local population disarmed. Explaining his order,\n        Khairkhwa said: We must assure ourselves ofa reliable and calm rear.\n\nld\n        The court notes that the actions attributed to the petitioner in this radio report are highly\n\nconsistent with the descriptions of the petitioner's actions in both the previously-discussed State\n\nDepartment cable and the July 13, 1998 report. See GE 2 at 1; GE 4 at 1. In each of these\n\ninstances, the petitioner is credited with choosing to make strategic delays in his advance\n\n\n\n\n               ,,\n\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ntowards Mazar-e-Sharif.

The statements attributed to the\n\npetitioner in the radio report are also consistent with the petitioner's testimony before the ARB,\n\nduring which he acknowledged overseeing the Taliban's efforts to disarm the citizens of northem\n\nAfghanistan during the Taliban's northern offensive.27 GE 71 at 7.\n\n       Moreover, these accounts of the petitioner's role in the capture of Meymaneh and\n\nSheberghan are consistent with and corroborated by yet another report regarding the Taliban's\n\nconquest of Mazar-e-Sharif on August 8, 1998. On November 6, 1998, Asiaweek, a western\n\nnews magazine, published an article entitled, \"Inside Story: Afghanistan Ethnic Cleansing.\" GE\n\nII at 1. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews with eyewitnesses, the article\n\ndescribed the systematic massacre of the Shiite population of Mazar-e-Sharif following the\n\nTaliban's conquest of that city. See generally id The article specifically noted that \"laurels for\n\nthe conquest of Aug. 8 went to Khairullah Khairkhwah, a Ta1iban mullah who when not busy\n\nmaking war doubles as the regime's 'interior minister.'\" Jd at 3.\n\n       Although the petitioner contends that the author of the Asiaweek article does not specify\n\nthe sources on which he based his reporting, the article expressly states that the account is drawn\n\nfrom \"interviews with survivors ... and documents obtained from international aid\n\norganizations.\" Jd at 1. Furthermore, the only aspect of the Asiaweek article that the petitioner\n\nhas challenged is the portion of the article stating that the petitioner received credit for the\n\nconquest of Mazar-e-Sharif. Indeed, counsel for the petitioner acknowledged that this article\n\nwas a \"fairly reliable document.\" Mar. 28 Tr. at 81, 92. Finally, the Asiaweek account is\n\nconsistent with the overall narrative set forth in the different news reports discussed to this point,\n\n27\n        Even ifthe court were to credit the petitioner's assertion that his role in the Taliban's northern\n        offensive was limited to disanning the local populations conquered by TaJiban forces, see GE 3\n        at 2; GE 71 at 4, this fact would demonstrate that the petitioner was entrusted with significant\n        military-support responsibilities during a time ofongoing conflict and undermine the petitioner's\n        contention that he was merely a civilian bureaucrat with no involvement in any military matters.\n\n                                         vLbd~t,               :\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                 ,   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nwhich document the petitioner's role as a commander of Taliban forces that advanced toward\n\nMazar-e-Sharif from the west, conquering the cities of Meymaneh and Sheberghan along the\n\nway, and entered the city on August 8, 1998. ld.\n\n       The petitioner contends that these media reports are unreliable because they rely on\n\ninformation disseminated by Radio Shariat, a Taliban-controlled radio station. According to\n\nKarzai, Radio Shariat was merely a mouthpiece for the Taliban government that \"did nothing but\n\ndistribute propaganda.\" Mar. 31 Tr. at 152. The purpose of Radio Shariat reports \"was mostly\n\nto boost the morale of [TalibanJ foot soldiers, mostly to tell individuals that we're going to go\n\nprepare to take over the area.\" Id. at 117. Because Radio Shariat is not a reliable source of\n\ninformation, the petitioner argues, aU ofthe articles reporting on the petitioner's role in the\n\nTaliban's northern offensive of 1998 are also unreliable.\n\n       The petitioner's arguments are unpersuasive. As an initial matter, not every media report\n\ndiscussed above relied on information provided by Radio Shariat. The portion of the July 13,\n\n1998 article describing the petitioner's role as the head of forces at Meymaneh appears to have\n\nbeen based on the reporter's conversations with Taliban officials identified in the article, such as\n\nMawlawi Abdurrahman and Mullah Abdul Raj. GE 4 at 1-2. Likewise, there is nothing to\n\nindicate that the Moscow Radio Rossii report or the Asiaweek article relied on Radio Shariat\n\nreports. See generally GE 6; GE 11.\n\n       More fundamentally, even if the principal purpose of Radio Shariat was to distribute\n\npropaganda to boost the morale of Taliban troops, the petitioner has offered no explanation for\n\nwhy the Taliban would have repeatedly and deliberately misidentified him as a commander of\n\nthe Taliban offensive. The petitioner's theory - that all of these reports were disseminated as\n\npart ofa prolonged conspiracy to falsely identify a civilian bureaucrat with no military\n\n\n\n\n                                                 41\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nexperience as a leader of Taliban forces to boost the morale of fighters - is too farfetched,\n\nspeculative and unexplained to be credited by the court.\n\n       The petitioner also conjectures that once he was falsely identified as a military\n\ncommander in one article, this label was picked up and repeated in subsequent news reports\n\nwithout independent corroboration Of verification. This theory, however, is not supported by the\n\nrecord. The articles discussed above report on the petitioner's activities at particular points\n\nduring the summer 1998 offensive. GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 1; GE 11 at 4. The petitioner\n\ndoes not explain how, tor instance, his reported decision to halt his troops' advance to collect\n\nweapons from the local populations, GE 6 at I, could have been propagated from a report that\n\nweeks before, he had been consolidating Taliban forces at Meymaneh, GE 4 at 2. Likewise,\n\nthere is no evidence that the Asiaweek article reporting that the petitioner received \"laurels\" for\n\nthe capture of Mazar-e-Sharif was based on any ofthe previously discussed articles, which all\n\npredate the August 8, 1998 conquest of Mazar-e-Sharif. See generally GE 3, 4, 5,6.\n\n       Finally, the court notes that all of these media accounts of the petitioner's role as a\n\nTaliban commander during the summer 1998 northern offensive - as well as the reports of the\n\npetitioner'S role as a Taliban commander in September 1997 - are corroborated by the statements\n\nof a former Afghan mujahideen commander, Mohammad Akhtiar (ISN 1036). See GE 22 (ISN\n\n1036 SIR (Dec, 27, 2005» at 1-2. Akhtiar was a former colonel or lieutenant colonel in the\n\nAfghan mujahideen during the Soviet occupation. Id at 1. When asked by GTMO interrogators\n\nwhether he knew of any other detainees with ties to the Taliban or al-Qaida, one of the\n\nindividuals that Akhtiar identified was the petitioner. Id After noting that the petitioner had\n\nbeen the Taliban Governor of Herat, Akhtiar stated that \"KhiruIlah once held the position of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                 I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ndivision commander, commander of a military corps, was the Governor of Mazar-e-Sharif and in\n\nparticular was a sub-commander/trusted person of Mullah Omar.\" Id.\n\n       The petitioner does not dispute the government's contention that Akhtiar was a senior\n\nofficer within the Afghan mujahideen and was in a position to know the structure ofthe\n\nTaliban's armed forces. Nor is there any evidence that Akhtiar was coerced into making his\n\nstatements about the petitioner; to the contrary, the interrogation report states that \"the direct\n\napproach orchestrated with the pride and ego up (proper military protocol) and love of country\n\nwere and have been the approaches used\" by interrogators to elicit information from Akhtiar. Id.\n\nThe interrogation report notes that Akhtiar had been deemed truthful and cooperative. ld.\n\n       Although Akhtiar incorrectly identified the petitioner as the \"Governor ofMazar-e-\n\nSharif,\" id. at 1, this statement does not dramatically alter the court's assessment of Akhtiar's\n\nreliability, as it is undisputed that the petitioner possessed administrative authority over\n\nterritories captured during the Taliban's northern offensive in the summer of 1998, including\n\nMazar-e-Sharif. See, e.g., PE 36, Att. Bat 1 (interview statement of former Taliban official\n\nAbdul Salam Rocketi, in which Rocketi states that the petitioner traveled to Mazar-e-Sharif after\n\nthe Taliban's conquest of the city to assist in administrative matters); PE 70 at 3 (petitioner's\n\nARB testimony acknowledging that he went to Mazar-e-Sharifto assist the Taliban forces that\n\ncaptured the city); GE 15 (Taleban in North Tell UN Human Rights Guaranleed, MAZAR-E\n\nSHARIF VOICE OF SHARI' AH RADIO, Aug. 8, 1998) at I (reporting that \"[t]he acting minister of\n\ninternal affairs and coordinator of the northern provinces, esteemed Mowlawi Khayrollah\n\nKhairkhwa, met a delegation ofthe UN Commission for Human Rights\"). The petitioner also\n\nattacks the reliability of Akhtiar's statements by noting that the interrogation report indicates that\n\nAkhtiar was to be shown a picture of the petitioner at his next interrogation, GE 22 at 2, but there\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                 I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nis no indication that such an identification ever took place. Yet Akhtiar stated during the\n\ninterrogation that his statements concerned \"the Herat province Taliban Governor,\" id at 1, and\n\nthere is no dispute that the petitioner was the Governor of Herat, GE 91   1 17.   Thus, there is no\n\nuncertainty that Akhtiar was referring to the petitioner in his statements.\n\n       In assessing the reliability of Akhtiar's statements, the court has considered the fact that\n\nAkhtiar does not expressly identifY the source of his information about the petitioner, does not\n\nprovide detailed allegations about the petitioner, see GE 22 at 1, and had requested psychological\n\ntreatment around the time he made these statements, PE 72 (medical records for ISN 1036) at 1­\n\n4. Nonetheless, in light of the corroboration between Akhtiar's statements and the media reports\n\naddressing the petitioner's role as a Taliban commander, the classified State Department cable\n\nreporting on the petitioner's role as a military commander, the interrogator's assessments of\n\nAkhtiar's truthfulness and the lack of any evidence of undue coercion, the court concludes that\n\nAkhtiar's statements are sufficiently reliable and provide additional support for the government's\n\nallegation that the petitioner served as a Taliban military commander.\n\n       To rebut this evidence, the petitioner relies heavily on a March 2002 interrogation report\n\nin which the interrogator credits the petitioner's claim that he was never a military commander.\n\nPE 25 (ISN 579 SIR (Mar. 14,2002») at 1. The court notes that the interrogator's conclusions\n\nregarding the petitioner appear to have been influenced in significant part by his assessment of\n\nthe petitioner's demeanor - namely, that the petitioner\n\n                                          no signs of deception. See id This assessment was not,\n\nhowever, shared by other interrogators who questioned the petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 that when the\n\npetitioner answers a question, \"it will be minimal at best and require extensive follow up\").\n\nFurthermore, although the interrogation report states that unidentified \"local sources\"\n\ncorroborate the petitioner's claim that he was not a military commander at any battle for Mazar­\n\ne-Sharif, PE 25 at 1-2, as previously discussed, the petitioner has been identified as such a\n\ncommander in a variety of sources, including a classified State Department cable, a publication\n\nthat the petitioner's expert has described as a major scholarly work, the statements of a senior\n\nAfghan mujahideen commander and in numerous contemporaneous media reports. In the court's\n\nview, this single interrogation report does not, by itself or in conjunction with the other evidence\n\noffered by the petitioner, outweigh the evidence establishing the petitioner's role as a military\n\ncommander.\n\n       The petitioner also relies on statements by two former Taliban officials, Mullah Abdul\n\nSalam Rocketi 28 and Wakil Akhmad Motawakil,29 to support his contention that he was never a\n\nmilitary leader. In interviews given to the petitioner's investigator, both men stated that the\n\npetitioner was a civilian administrator and not a military commander. See generally PE 36, Att.\n\n\n\n28 \t\n        Rockett is a fonner Taliban military commander who led Taliban forces during the U.S.-led\n        invasion of Afghanistan.

B. Rocketi stated that although the petitioner was in Mazar-e-Sharifin the\n\nsummer of 1998, he traveled there \"on a civil duty\" and \"not as part of the military team when\n\nTaliban [forces] took over the city,\" PE 36, Att. B at 1. Likewise, Motawakil stated that the\n\npetitioner was not a military official and had always worked as a civilian administrator. PE 43,\n\nAtt. B at 4.\n\n        In the court's view, these statements do not, standing alone or in conjunction with the\n\nother evidence offered by the petitioner, overcome the weight of the evidence establishing the\n\npetitioner's military role. Unlike the news reports, scholarly works and other sources previously\n\ndiscussed, Rocketi and Motawakil provided their statements on the petitioner's behalf expressly\n\nfor use in this litigation. See generally PE 36; PE 43. Karzai himself indicated that Rocketi had\n\na close relationship with the petitioner, having served as a corps commander in Herat during the\n\npetitioner's tenure as the Governor of Herat. Mar. 31 Tr. at 87 (counting Rocketi among the\n\nindividuals who had \"daily and regular contacts with Mullah Khairkhwa\"). Similarly, Karzai\n\ntestified that Motawakil is \"extremely interested in detainee affairs\" and works with Karzai's\n\nCentre for Conflict and Peace Studies, which has acknowledged that it has an interest in seeking\n\nthe petitioner's release. See Mar. 31 Tr. at 125.\n\n        The court also notes that Rocketi and Motawakil provide only broad statements about the\n\npetitioner's role within the Taliban and do not specify the bases for their assertions about the\n\npetitioner's activities in Mazar-e-Sharif. See PE 36, Att. B at 1-2; PE 43, Att. Bat 4-6. These\n\nstatements stand in stark contrast to the detailed accounts contained in the State Department\n\ncable and the media reports addressing the petitioner's role as a military commander, which\n\ncontain contemporaneous accounts ofthe petitioner's activities created long before the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    46\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                I   ,\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n                                              SKCIY!;i'\n\n\npetitioner's apprehension and years before the commencement of this litigation. See generally\n\nGE 2-6, I 1,88.\n\n       Similar considerations limit the weight that the court affords Karzai' s testimony\n\nregarding the petitioner's roles within the Taliban. Although Karzai testified that the petitioner\n\nwas never a Taliban military commander, Mar. 31 Tr. at 115, 119, his testimony does not\n\nindependently corroborate the statements ofRocketi and Motawakil, as Karzai acknowledged\n\nthat he based his conclusions about the petitioner primarily on conversations he had with\n\nindividuals associated with the petitioner, id. at 85-88, including Rocketi, id at 87, and,\n\npresumably, Motawakil, id at 88,109. Furthermore, Karzai candidly acknowledged that he and\n\nhis organization, which is devoted to furthering the peace and stability of Afghanistan, have an\n\nindependent desire to see the petitioner released, testifying that\n\n        Mullah Khairkhwa is one of the individuals who has quite a lot of respect within\n        the Taliban and from so many different communities. His release couldhave a\n        significant impact on the peace process that exists in Afghanistan, particularly in\n        terms of national security and particularly in terms of what he can bring to the\n        table. Many of the senior people still hold him in very high esteem, in high\n        regards, so releasing him would make a very serious statement not only in terms\n        ofthe peace process but also about what the United States represents.\n\nMar. 31 Tr. at 125.\n\n       Thus, Karzai's comments about the petitioner appear to have been motivated by policy\n\nconsiderations unrelated to the evidence at issue here. Although there can be no doubt about the\n\nnobility and importance of the cause championed by Karzai and his organization, considerations\n\nabout the wisdom and utility of releasing the petitioner, which motivated Karzai's testimony, are\n\nmatters for the political branches beyond the purview of this court. See supra Part IV.A.\n\n       Additional considerations also lead the court to question Karzai's conclusions about the\n\npetitioner. For instance, Karzai testified that the petitioner could not have been a military\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                  r   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\ncommander during the conquest of Mazar-e-Sharifbecause Ialiban forces were led by Mullah\n\nFaisel, chief of the army for the Taliban, and later by Mullah Dadullah and Mullah Niazi. Mar.\n\n31 Ir. at 115-16. Yet according to Karzai, the Taliban assault on Mazar-e-Sharif involved tens\n\nof thousands of soldiers, id. at 119, a fact that would suggest that the Ialiban must have had\n\nmultiple commanders leading its forces, see, e.g., GE 48 at 100-01 (listing various Ialiban\n\nofficials who acted as commanders during the assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif). The fact that the\n\npetitioner was not the only or most senior Taliban commander involved in the operation does not\n\nmean that he could not have led Taliban fighters during these engagements.\n\n       Karzai also testified that the petitioner could not have served as a commander during the\n\nconquest of Mazar-e-Sharif \"because he has absolutely no military background, never fought in a\n\nbattle, [and] was religiously educated.\" Mar. 31 Ir. at 119. Yet, as previously discussed, the\n\npetitioner did possess prior military experience, having fought with the Afghan mujahideen\n\nduring the Soviet occupation. See supra Part IV.B.2.a. Furthermore, the fact that the petitioner\n\nwas \"religiously educated\" provides little support for Karzai's conclusion; as previously\n\ndiscussed, most of the senior leaders oftbe Taliban, including Mullah Omar, had received\n\nreligious education in madrassas, see GE 48 at 252-55; GE 88 at 21) and, as Karzai himself\n\nacknowledged in bis declaration, most ofthe Taliban's foot soldiers were recruited from'radical\n\nmadrassas, PE 11 0 ~ 9.\n\n       Finally, the court notes that the statements of Karzai, Rocketi and Motawakil all appear to\n\ndraw on the presumption that there existed within the Taliban a strict division between military\n\nand civilian personneL See Mar. 31 Tr. at 118-19 (Karzai' s testimony that military and civilian\n\nresponsibilities were distinct); id at 149 (Karzai's testimony that there was no overlap between\n\ncivilian and military chains of command); PE 36, Att. B at 1 (Rocketi' s testimony that the\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npetitioner \"was a civilian person, not a military commander\"); PE 43, Att. B at 5 (MotawakiI's\n\nstatement that \"[wJe have a structure in Afghanistan that military belongs to Ministry of Defense.\n\nBut [the petitioner] was the interior minister, governor, a spokesman.\").\n\n       This presumption, however, contradicts the weight of the evidence regarding the structure\n\nof the Taliban government. For instance, one scholar notes that\n\n       [0Jne of the most remarkable characteristics of the Taliban leadership is that top\n       government officials often switch from the battlefield to the ministry and back\n       again. each time following the orders from Mullah Omar. In one sense, this\n       produces remarkable flexibility among the Taliban hierarchy as they all act as\n       both administrators and military commanders.\n\nGE 47 (Nasreen Ghufran, The Taliban and the Civil War Entanglement in Afghanistan, 41\n\nASIAN SURV., no. 3, at 462) at 474.\n\n       This observation is echoed by Rashid, who writes:\n\n       Several members of the military Shura are also acting ministers, creating even\n       greater chaos in the Kabul administration. Thus Mullah Mohammed Abbas, the\n       Health Minister, was the second-in-command of the Taliban expeditionary force\n       trapped in the north after the 1997 Mazar defeat. He was then pulled out and sent\n       to Herat to organize another offensive and finally returned to his job as Minister\n       six months later . . \"      Mullah Ehsanullah Ehsan, the Governor of the State\n       Bank[,J commanded an elite force of some 1,000 Kandaharis, ensuring his\n       financial job received little attention before he was killed in Mazar in 1997.\n       Mullah Abdul Razaq, Governor of Herat, who was captured in Mazar in 1997\n       and later freed, has been leading military offensives all over the country since\n       1994.

See GE 5 at 2; GE 48 at\n\n100-01. The court credits these reports, which identify specific Taliban leaders who functioned\n\nas dual military and civilian officials, over the broad assertions ofKarzai, Rocketi and\n\nMotawakil, and finds that they provide additional support for the conclusion that the petitioner\n\npossessed military responsibilities while he held the post ofActing Interior Minster. See GE 11\n\nat 3 (\"Laurels for the conquest of Aug. 8 went to Khairullah Khairkhwah, a Taliban mullah who\n\nwhen not busy making war doubles as the regime's 'interior minister.''').\n\n      iv. Summary of the Evidence Regarding the Petitioner's Role at Mazar-e-Sharif\n\n       In swnmary, the weight of the evidence supports the government's contention that the\n\npetitioner served as a military commander during the Taliban's assaults on Mazar-e-Sharif in\n\nSeptember 1997 and the summer of 1998. It is far from clear that these findings, standing alone,\n\nwould establish the lawfulness of the petitioner's detention. Nonetheless, together with the\n\nevidence of the petitioner's involvement with the Afghan mujahideen, see supra Part IV.B.2.a,\n\nand the petitioner's membership on the TaIiban's Supreme Shura, see infra Part IV.B.2.c, they\n\nundermine the petitioner's claim that he was merely a civilian official shielded from the\n\nTaliban's military affairs and support the notion, as elaborated in the following sections, that the\n\npetitioner remained integrally involved in the Taliban's military forces before and after the U.s.­\n\nled invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n                   c. The Petitioner's Position on the Taliban's Supreme Shura\n\n       As the Taliban rose to power, they instituted a ruling structure organized in three\n\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nCommander of the Faithful). Mullah Omar. Id Below Mullah Omar was the ten-member\n\nSupreme Shura. which was based in Kandahar. reported directly to Mullah Omar and, according\n\nto Karzai, was ''It]he highest decision making body of the Taliban.\" Id; accord GE 48 at 250.\n\nSubordinate to the Supreme Shura were two sub-councils, the Military Shura and the Kabul\n\nShura. PE 110\"19,21.\n\n       Ample evidence establishes that the petitioner served as a member of the Taliban's\n\nSupreme Shura. GE 48 at 250; GE 88 at 44; Mar. 31 Tr. at 135. It is equally clear that the\n\nSupreme Shura possessed authority over military matters. Karzai noted that the Military Shura, a\n\nbody \"in charge of devising strategies and implementing tactical decisions,\" reported to the\n\nSupreme Shura. PE 110,21. The Kabul Shura, whose responsibilities included \"the Kabul\n\nfront against the Northern Alliance,\" also reported to the Supreme Shura. Id, 22 (noting that\n\n\"(i]mportant issues\" faced by the Kabul Shura \"were conveyed to the Supreme Shura for\n\ndecisions to be made\"). Indeed, Karzai stated that \"[i]n addition to the I 0 permanent members,\n\n[Supreme] Shura meetings a1so involved military commanders, tribal leaders\" and others. ld,\n\n20.\n\n       The petitioner notes that after 1996, governmental power was concentrated in the hands\n\nofMullah Omar, who held ultimate decision-making authority over all matters. GE 48 at 102;\n\nPE 110, 18. Nonetheless, even after the Supreme Shura's decision-making authority waned, it\n\ncontinued to have a \"consultative function.\" PE 110 , 18. It is therefore unsurprising that,\n\naccording to Rashid, \"[aJlmost all of the members ofthe Kandahar and Kabul Shura, except for\n\nthose with physical disabilities, have acted as military commanders at some time or the other.\"\n\nGE 48 at 100-01.\n\n\n\n\n                                                51 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                            8El!MT\n\n       The fact that the petitioner was appointed to serve on the Supreme Shura, which reported\n\ndirectly to Mul1ah Omar, possessed responsibility over military matters and was comprised\n\nalmost exclusively of military commanders, cuts against the petitioner's assertion that he was a\n\ncivilian bureaucrat sequestered from the Taliban's military matters. The petitioner's membership\n\nin the Supreme Shura is also consistent with the evidence that the petitioner obtained military\n\nexperience with the Afghan mujahideen, led Taliban forces during the Taliban's northern\n\noffensives in 1997 and 1998 and, as discussed below, continued to wield military responsibilities\n\nthrough the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n     d. \tThe Petitioner's Military Responsibilities as Governor of Herat Leading Up to\n                                Operation Enduring Freedom\n\n       On October 27, 1999, Mullah Omar appointed the petitioner to serve as Governor of\n\nHerat, a post that he held at the time of the U.S.-led invasion in October 2001. GE 91   ~   17; GE\n\n43 at 2.

The court notes that in a recent\n\nstatement on its \"successful administrative poHcy,\" describing the structure, positions and\n\npolicies of a prospective Taliban government, the Taliban explained that each province of\n\nAfghanistan \"is an independent unit with a commander called the Governor\" who is \"directly\n\nresponsible for the Supreme Command of that province and directs its military, civilian, fmancial\n\nand legal affairs.\" See GE 49 (Ikram Maiwandi, The Islamic Emirate ofAfghanistan and Its\n\nSuccessful Administrative Policy, AL-SOMOODMAGAZINE, Jan. 27, 201 I) at 2.

See id.\n\n       This governance model is consistent with the fact that nearly all senior Taliban leaders\n\nheld both civilian and military positions, see, e.g., GE 48 at 100-0 I, as well as the fact that the\n\nindividual who preceded the petitioner as Governor of Herat, Mullah Abdul Razaq, was a senior\n\nmilitary commander who was captured at Mazar-e-Sharif in 1997 and, after his release, led\n\nmilitary offensives all over the country, GE 48 at 100; GE 88 at 100. The facts support the\n\nnotion that the petitioner had both military and civilian responsibilities as the Governor of Herat.\n\n       Indeed, since his capture by Pakistani authorities in early 2002, the petitioner has\n\ndisplayed a level of detailed knowledge about military installations in Herat that would suggest\n\nhe was no mere tax collector. For example, during one interrogation, the petitioner stated that\n\n        the Taliban's 2 largest divisions were located in the region of Herat. One of the\n        divisions w[asJ located in 4-5 km East ofthe Governors Office Building in Herat.\n        This division consisted mainly of equipment that was left behind by the Russians.\n        Approx. 30-40 tanks, (some not operational), all types of artillery, weaponry,\n        \"lots\" of shoulder rockets displayed on the tarmac[] for everyone to see how\n        strong the Taliban was.\n\nGE 46 (ISN 579 MFR (Sept. 25, 2003)) at 1.\n\n        According to the petitioner, this division possessed three jets, one cargo plane and two\n\nhelicopters and was commanded by Abdul Salam Rocketi.

Although the Stingers\n        were prized, the Taliban had no interest in Soviet made SA-7's or \"blue pipes\" as\n        they were called.

Rather, this knowledge, coupled with the\n\npetitioner's detailed knowledge about the locations, personnel and weapons of various military\n\nbases in Herat and the fact that the petitioner's predecessor was a seasoned military commander,\n\nsupport the notion that Taliban provincial governors like the petitioner possessed authority over\n\nboth military and civilian matters related to their district.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   55 \n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       The evidence also indicates that the petitioner's purportedly civilian duties - in particular,\n\nthe disbursement of Taliban funds     had, at least on occasion, a direct nexus to Taliban military\n\n\n\n\n       The court's ability to assess the reliability this report is hindered by the report's failure to\n\nexpressly identify its source.

Khairkhwa was unsure if they meant that they\n\nhad satellite capability, but thought the Iranians were speaking figuratively rather than literally\n\nregarding intelligence collection.\" Id\n\n       The petitioner also acknowledged during his CSRT hearing that he was present at the\n\nOctober 2001 meeting during which Iran pledged to assist the Taliban in their war with the\n\nUnited States, GE 70 at 2, and testified during his ARB hearing that at the October 2001\n\nmeeting, \"[t]hc Iranians offered to buy weapons for us because we were on restriction and could\n\nnot buy them. That is the truth.\" GE 71 at 8.\n\n       These statements, given at different times during the petitioner's detention, are highly\n\nconsistent with one another, and there is no evidence that these statements are unreliable because\n\nthey were elicited through undue coercion or duress. Accordingly, the court considers these\n\nstatements reliable evidence that the petitioner was part of the Taliban delegation that met with\n\nIranian officials to discuss Iran's offer to provide the Taliban with military aid on the eve of the\n\nU.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\n                                                 '(' r'    r   \"r\n                                                 63\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n            ,. -, \t \" .\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n                                              SI!3€M'f\n\n\n       The petitioner has contended that it is implausible that the Iranians would have offered to\n\nprovide military assistance to the Taliban because Iran considered the Taliban an arch-enemy\n\nand allied itself with the United States and the Northern Alliance during Operation Enduring\n\nFreedom. See, e.g., Mar. 31 Tr. at 100-01;PE     110~~25-30;    PE lllA ~~ 10-16; PE 75 at 246­\n\n54; PE 78 at 2-3. The court finds these arguments unpersuasive. As an initial matter, the\n\npetitioner's theory - that Iran could not have offered any military assistance to the Taliban\n\nbecause Iran and the Taliban were enemies - does not adequately account for the complexity of\n\ninternational relationships in that region. As noted in an article cited by the petitioner, \"Iran has\n\nplayed all sides of the Afghan conflict,\" having provided military support to different, competing\n\ngroups vying for control of Afghanistan before and after the fall ofthe Taliban. PE 75 at 2-3.\n\nIndeed, even as the United States and Iran ostensibly allied themselves during Operation\n\nEnduring Freedom, \"Iran also sent large stocks of weapons to Herat and [Afghan warlord Ismail]\n\nKhan, which culminated in the United States firing a cruise missile at Khan's Headquarters,\n\nkilling eighteen of his men in January 2002.\" Id. at 3.\n\n       As noted in another article cited by the petitioner, former CIA Director George Tenet\n\ndeclared in early 2002 that Iran's initial signs of cooperation had \"eclipsed\" and that \"while\n\nIran's officials express a shared interest in a stable government in Afghanistan, its security forces\n\nappear bent on countering the US presence. This seeming contradiction in behavior reflects\n\ndeep-seated suspicions among Tehran's clerics that the US is committed to encircling and\n\noverthrowing them.\" PE 76 at 248. Yet another article cited by the petitioner states that \"[i]n\n\nearly 2007, Washington reported that Iran had started to supply sophisticated arms to the Taliban\n\nin western Afghanistan,\" even as it \"increased political and military support to the former\n\nNorthern Alliance.\" PE 78 at 3. Although Karzai stated in his declaration that evidence of\n\n                                                       r ' .'\n\n                                                  64\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n                                             SECM'f\n\nIranian support for the Taliban reflects a recent shift in Iranian policy towards the Taliban, PE\n\n110129, these reports indicate Iran did not possess a unitary attitude towards the U.S.-led\n\ninvasion of Afghanistan at the time of Operation Enduring Freedom and underscores the\n\ndifficulty of presuming that Iran would not have offered military support to the Taliban simply\n\nbecause of their history of animosity.\n\n       Moreover, the petitioner himself is the source of the information regarding the October\n\n2001 meeting between the Taliban delegation and senior Iranian officials. As previously noted,\n\nthe petitioner has provided multiple, consistent accounts of Iran's offer to provide the Taliban\n\nwith military assistance. The petitioner has offered no explanation for why he would have\n\nfabricated this information during his interrogations. Indeed, in his proposed [mdings of fact, the\n\npetitioner acknowledges that he attended the October 2001 meeting with the Iranian delegation,\n\nthough he does not expressly concede that the purpose of the meeting was Iran's offer to provide\n\nmilitary support to the Taliban. See Petr's Proposed Findings of Fact, 292.\n\n       The petitioner also contends his mere attendance at the October 2001 meeting does not\n\nsupport his detention because he was simply there to provide security for the Taliban delegation.\n\nGE 71 at 2, 7. The court disagrees. First, even if the petitioner's role was limited to providing\n\nsecurity for the Taliban delegation, that fact would itself significantly undercut the petitioner's\n\ncontention that he was simply a civilian bureaucrat and would demonstrate that he possessed\n\ncommand authority over Taliban forces on the eve of the U.S.-led invasion and was entrusted\n\nwith providing security services in support of a military-related mission. At any rate, the fact\n\nthat the petitioner was included in the substantive discussions, see, e.g., GE 70 at 2-3, coupled\n\nwith his demonstrated knowledge about missile systems, his military oversight responsibilities as\n\nthe Governor of Herat and his close ties to Mullah Omar, see infra Part IV.B.3, suggest that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 65\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\npetitioner attended the October 2001 meeting not simply as the Taliban's chief security officer,\n\nbut as a Taliban representative.\n\n       Finally, the petitioner contends that his attendance at the October 2001 meeting does not\n\nsupport the lawfulness of his detention because there is no evidence that the Iranian offer was\n\never accepted. The court notes at the outset that the petitioner has provided differing accounts of\n\nthe Taliban's response to the Iranian offer. See GE 60 at 3 (\"Ultimately, the offer was\n\nrejected.\"); GE 71 at 8 (\"When the delegation went back to Kandahar the bombing started, so the\n\nproposition fell apart. \"); GE 57 at 2 (\"[The petitioner] fled the area shortly after the meeting and\n\ndoes not know if the offer was ever given to Omar.\"). At any rate, the significance of this\n\nevidence does not turn on whether the Taliban accepted the Iranian offer, but rather, lies in the\n\nfact that Taliban leaders in Kandahar designated the petitioner to represent the Taliban in high-\n\nlevel discussions with senior Iranian officials regarding Iran's offer to provide military assistance\n\nto the Taliban in preparation for the imminent U.S.-led invasion. The petitioner's selection to\n\nattend the meeting demonstrates that he was entrusted with significant military-related\n\nresponsibilities at the time of the outbreak of hostilities with the United States and strongly\n\nindicates that he was part of Taliban forces at that time.32\n\n       The petitioner's role in the October 2001 meeting is consistent with evidence that after\n\nthe commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, the petitioner continued to operate within\n\nthe Taliban's formal command structure and provide support for Taliban military forces.\n\n\n\n\n32\n        The government has argued that the petitioner attended a second meeting with Iranian officials in\n        November 200 I regarding Iran's offer to provide military assistance to the Taliban. See GE 45 at\n        3; GE 61 at 1-2. It appears, however, that the November 2001 meeting referred to in these\n        exhibits and the October 200 I meeting discussed above are one and the same. See GE 45 at 3;\n        GE 61 at 1-2.\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nwith the prior reports regarding the petitioner's role in providing financial support for Taliban\n\ntroops and security forces, see GE 46 at 2                as well as the petitioner's prior\n\nacknowledgment that Herat contained the Taliban's two largest military divisions and multiple\n\nmilitary insta1lations,                      43 at 2; GE 46 at I. Accordingly, the court concludes\n\nthat this intelligence report is sufficiently reliable for the court's consideration and further\n\ndemonstrates that the petitioner continued to operate within the Taliban's formal command\n\nstructure and provide support to Taliban troops after the outset of hostilities with U.S. coalition\n\nforces.\n\n          The petitioner's involvement with the Taliban's military apparatus continued even as\n\nU.S. coalition forces pushed the Taliban out ofnorthern Afghanistan. Although the petitioner\n\nhas provided contradictory accounts of his retreat from Herat, the petitioner has stated that in\n\nearly November 2001, as the bombs began to fall in Herat province, he traveled in a convoy of\n\nten vehicles to Arghastan, a village in the eastern part of Kandahar province.

There is no evidence that this statement was elicited through undue coercion\n\nor duress, and the statement was made shortly after the events at issue. See GE 18 at 1.\n\nAccordingly, the court credits the petitioner's initial admission that he fled to Kandahar in a\n\nconvoy comprised of ten vehicles that were full of weapons.\n\n       The fact that the petitioner had access to a large volume of weapons demonstrates that he\n\ncontinued to wield military-type authority even after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nFurthermore, although the petitioner contends that he turned the weapons over to an official in\n\nArghastan affiliated with the post-Taliban government, this claim is not plausible, as the Taliban\n\ndid not lose control of Kandahar until December 7,2001, weeks after the petitioner fled Herat for\n\nArghastan. GE 91 ~ 9. AccordinglY, if, as the petitioner has stated, he surrendered the weapons\n\nin his convoy to a local \"sherif' in Arghastan, it would have been to a local Taliban official.\n\n       Accordingly, reliable evidence demonstrates that the petitioner was appointed to\n\nrepresent the Taliban in discussions with high-level Iranian officials regarding Iran's offer to\n\nprovide the Taliban military assistance for use against U.S. coalition forces. Reliable evidence\n\nalso indicates that after the U.s.-led invasion, the petitioner continued to provide material\n\nsupport to TaHban forces stationed in Herat and facilitated their movement to other areas in\n\nAfghanistan, implementing orders issued by Taliban leadership in Kandahar. Finally, the\n\npetitioner has admitted that in early November 2001, he retreated from Herat to the Taliban­\n\n                                                               \".·,c'. \"\n                                           ,   .. 1   ;\n                                          ~,~)= ~~~ ~\n                                                          68\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n                                             SELMI\n\n\nstronghold of Kandahar in a convoy of vehicles full of weapons, and that he delivered those\n\nweapons to officials in Kandahar.\n\n       These findings are consistent with the evidence establishing the petitioner's long history\n\nof involvement with the Taliban's military affairs. Like most senior Taliban leaders, the\n\npetitioner obtained military experience fighting with the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet\n\noccupation. After joining the Taliban in 1994, the petitioner was entrusted with military\n\nresponsibilities, sitting on the Taliban's Supreme Shura, which had oversight over military\n\naffairs and serving as a commander of Taliban fighters during the Taliban's northern offensives\n\nin 1997 and 1998. The petitioner remained intimately involved in the Taliban's military affairs\n\neven after being appointed Governor of Herat, as demonstrated by his detailed knowledge about\n\nmilitary installations and weapons systems, his facilitation of funding for Taliban military and\n\nintelligence forces as well as his role as a Taliban representative during discussions with Iranian\n\nofficials in January 2000 regarding military and security-related matters.\n\n       Together, this evidence establishes that the petitioner was part of the Taliban forces\n\nengaged in hostilities with U.S.-led coalition forces in late 2001. Accordingly, so long as the\n\nevidence indicates that the petitioner remained a part ofthose forces and had not disassociated\n\nhimself from the Taliban by the time of his capture in early 2002, the petitioner's detention is\n\nlawful under the AUMF. Before turning to the issue of disassociation, however, the court briefly\n\naddresses the evidence concerning the petitioner's ties to Mullah Omar, which the government\n\ncontends provides additional support for the lawfulness of his detention.\n\n                       3. The Petitioner Had Close Ties to Mullah Omar\n\n       Since his apprehension in early 2002, the petitioner has sought to portray himself as a\n\nreluctant Taliban leader. The petitioner has stated that he \"was compeUed to work for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 69 \n\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               ,   I\n\f                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nTaliban because they were in power at the time and, if one didn't, the TaIiban could 'create\n\nproblems' for someone.\" GE 4S at 1. The petitioner has suggested that he joined the Taliban as\n\na matter of happenstance, stating that while trying to secure ajob in Spin Boldak in 1994, \"one\n\nday, an unknown Taliban member asked him to speak with a London, England BBC reporter on\n\nthe phone regarding Taliban military positions. The Taliban were so impressed with his\n\nspeaking abilities they offered him the position of 'wayand,' or spokesman for the Taliban.\" GE\n\n20 at 1. He has characterized his appointment as Governor of Herat as a move that came out of\n\nthe blue. Id. at 2 (\"Taliban official recommended he be appointed Governor of Herat,\n\n[Afghanistan], for unknown reasons.\"). In fact, during various interrogations, the petitioner\n\ndenied holding leadership positions that he now concedes that he possessed. Compare OE 71 at\n\n3 (\"I was not the Taliban spokesman.\") and GE 43 at 1 (the petitioner's statement that \"he was\n\noften mistaken as the Minister of the Interior for the Taliban because he lived at the Ministry and\n\nspoke to the press often\") with Petr's Proposed Findings of Fact 1f 6 (\"After his return to\n\nAfghanistan in 1994, petitioner was appointed spokesperson for the Taliban government for the\n\nPashto language because of his proven abilities in providing information to the media.\"); GE 91\n\n~.   17 (stipulating that the petitioner became the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister in 1996 or\n\n1997).\n\n          Despite these efforts to portray himself as a reluctant, marginal Taliban figure, the\n\nevidence indicates that the petitioner was, in reality, a prominent and influential leader within the\n\nTaliban. For instance, as previously discussed, the petitioner quickly rose to the Taliban's\n\nhighest ranks, becoming a member of the Supreme Shura, \"the most powerful ruling body\" in the\n\nTaliban government, OE 48 at 250, which reported directly to Taliban leader Mullah Omar, PE\n\n1101f 19.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   70\n\n                            UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                  I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEOIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n                                              SECRET\n\n\n       The evidence also indicates that after the petitioner began to serve on the Supreme Shura,\n\n\n\n\nstatements of this mullah are corroborated by veteran Afghan mujahideen commander Akhtiar,\n\nwho identified the petitioner as \"a sub-commander/trusted person of Mullah Omar.\" GE 22 at 1.\n\n       These statements are further corroborated by a November 1999 article published in the\n\nPakistani newspaper, The News, reporting on Mullah Omar's decision to reshuffle the Taliban\n\nleadership. GE 40 (Editorial: Taleban ReshzifJle, THE NEWS, Nov. 1, 1999) at 1. This reshuffle\n\nresulted in the petitioner's appointment as Governor ofHe rat.

In July 1998, Mullah Omar appointed the petitioner to oversee the areas captured during\n\nthe Taliban's northern offensive. GE 3 at 2. In August 1998, when Iran threatened war with\n\nAfghanistan after the Taliban murdered eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist, Mullah\n\nOmar publicly announced that the petitioner would lead a commission to investigate the\n\nmurders. 33 GE 13 (Bodies ofRemaining 2 Iranians Found in Afghanistan, THE NEWS, Oct. 7,\n\n1998) at 1; GE 46 at 2.

According to the petitioner,\n\nMullah Omar's decision to appoint him Governor of Herat was effectively a demotion and\n\nsignaled the fact that the petitioner no longer held Mullah Omar's trust. Mar. 31 Tr. at 113.\n\n       The weight of the evidence does not support the petitioner's contention. Herat was a\n\nstrategically important province at the time ofthe petitioner's appointment as governor; it\n\nbordered Iran, which had recently threatened war with the Taliban and possessed historically\n\nclose ties with the population of Herat. PE 75 at 3; PE 76 at 244-45. Herat also contained\n\nnumerous Taliban military installations, including its two largest divisions, as well as the\n\nheadquarters of Taliban intelligence. GE 46 at I. Indeed, as previously noted, one\n\ncontemporaneous media report characterized the petitioner's new position one of the \"choicest\n\njobs\" in the Taliban government, awarded to the petitioner because he was a Mullah Omar\n\nloyalist. GE 40 at 1.\n\n       Moreover, reliable evidence indicates that the petitioner remained within Mullah Omar's\n\ninner circle after his appointment as Governor of Herat, as U.S. coalition forces began their\n\nassault on Taliban forces. Specifically, the court credits an October 13,2001 intelligence report\n\nciting information provided by a                                                               SeeGE\n\n\n\n\n                                                 72\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n27 (IIR 6 931 0020 02) at 1.\n\n                               that after a U.S. cruise missile had hit Mullah Omar's vehicle one\n\nweek earlier during air strikes in Kandahar,\n\n\n\n\nspecifically notes that this officer                                      The reliability of the\n\nreport is also buttressed by the level of detail contained in the officer's account, including\n\nspecific infonnation regarding the locations ofTatiban commanders that has been independently\n\ncorroborated. See id at 2 (reporting that Mullah Rocketi, the \"corps commander of Jalalabad[,]\n\nmoves between that city and north Kabul\"); PE 70 at 139 (listing Rocketi as the \"fonner corps\n\ncommander of Jalalabad\"). Lastly, the report of a missile strike occurring the week before\n\nOctober 13,2001 is consistent with the timeline of Operation Enduring Freedom, which\n\n\"commenced on 7 October 2001 with coalition air strikes on al-Qaida and Taliban targets\n\nthroughout Afghanistan.\" GE 77 at 2. In light ofthese indices of reliability, the court credits the\n\nreport's account that after a U.S. coalition airstrike in early October 2001, Mullah Omar limited\n\nhis circle of contacts to a handful of his most trusted and important \"commanders,\" including the\n\npetitioner.\n\n        In sum, the court finds implausible the petitioner's contention that he was a reluctant\n\nTaliban member. Rather, the weight of the evidence indicates that the petitioner had close ties\n\n\n\n\n                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n                I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nwith Mullah Dmar and that he remained one of Mullah Omar's most trusted associates before\n\nand after the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. This finding is consistent with\n\nthe court's earlier conclusions that the petitioner was a key Taliban leader entrusted with military\n\nresponsibilities, which he carried out both before and after the commencement of Operation\n\nEnduring Freedom. See supra Part IV.B.2. Moreover, the fact that the petitioner was one of\n\nMullah Omar's trusted associates undermines the petitioner's contention that he was a simple\n\ncivilian bureaucrat shielded from the Taliban's military activities, and provides a useful starting\n\npoint for assessing the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated himself from the Taliban\n\nby the time of his capture in early 2002.\n\n     4. Tbe Petitioner Remained Part oftbe Taliban at the Time of His Apprehension\n\n       As previously discussed, it is not enough for the government to show simply that the\n\npetitioner was, at one time, a member of the Taliban, al-Qaida or associated forces; to be\n\nlawfully detained, the petitioner must have been \"part of' those forces at the time of his capture.\n\nSee Salah;, 625 F.3d at 751; Gherebi, 609 F. Supp. 2d at 71. «A petitioner who may once have\n\nbeen part of al-Qaida or the Taliban can show that he was no longer part of such an entity at the\n\ntime of capture by showing that he took affirmative actions to abandon his membership.\" Khalif\n\nv.

May 28, 2010) (citing Al Ginco v. Obama, 626 F.\n\nSupp.2d 123, 128-30 (D.D.C. 2009)).\n\n       The evidence indicates that after tbe commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, the\n\npetitioner began hedging his bets. The petitioner has stated that he met with a group of high-\n\nlevel Taliban officials one month before the surrender of Kandahar to discuss the peaceful\n\nsurrender of the city. PE 34 at 1. According to the petitioner, the meeting was held without\n\nMullah Omar's consent and the officials present were those \"who favored a bloodless, peaceful\n                                                      t '.      ;~    , , :(\n                                                      \\!

GE 45 at 3; see also GE 18 at I (interrogation report in which the petitioner\n\nstated that he contacted Hamid Karzai to discuss surrendering after the United States began\n\nbombing Afghanistan); GE 70 at 4 (petitioner's CSRT testimony in which he states that he\n\ncontacted Hamid Karzai \"when Herat was taken over\"); GE 91 ~ 7 (stipUlating that the Taliban\n\nlost control of Herat on or about November 13, 2001). According to the petitioner, this evidence\n\ndemonstrates that he had disassociated himself from the Taliban before he was captured by\n\nPakistani authorities in late-January or early-February 2002. See GE 91   ~   18.\n\n       The court disagrees. Even if the petitioner did participate in a secret meeting with high-\n\nlevel Taliban leaders regarding the surrender of Kandahar, there is no evidence that any\n\nparticipant at that meeting surrendered to U.S. coalition forces, publicly or privately broke with\n\nMullah Omar or took any action signaling an intent to end hostilities with U.S. coalition forces.\n\nIndeed, in the month before the surrender of Kandahar, there was fierce fighting between U.S.\n\ncoalition and Taliban forces for control ofthe city until it fell on December 7, 2001. GE 77 at 4.\n\n       Likewise, even if the petitioner contacted Hamid Karzai in mid-November 2001 to\n\ndiscuss the possibility of surrender, the petitioner did not tum himself in, but was instead\n\ncaptured in Chaman, Pakistan approximately three months later. GE 91 ~ 18. The petitioner has\n\nprovided no credible explanation for what he was doing or what steps he had taken to\n\ndisassociate himself from the Taliban during the months after he allegedly contacted Hamid\n\nKarzai to discuss the possibility of surrender.\n\n\n\n\n                                     ~,,t,   1;''';''<:'''   ,,~.:\n\n\n\n                                     . .i     <,._ f,.~ __, ~\n                                                                     75\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\n       The petitioner has stated that by the time of his capture, he had resolved to cooperate with\n\nU.S. coalition forces and that he traveled to Chama.n, Pakistan to obtain treatment for a stomach\n\nailment before turning himself in. GE 45 at 3; GE 70 at 4; GE 71 at 9. The petitioner, however,\n\nwas not captured at a medical office in Chaman. Rather, it is undisputed that the petitioner was\n\ncaptured at the Pakistani residence of senior Taliban official Abdul Manan Niazi. GE 91 , 18.\n\nAs previously discussed, Niazi was a fonner Taliban military commander and Governor of\n\nKabul, who had personally overseen the massacre of thousands of Shiites in the city of Mazar-e-\n\nSharifin August 1998 and was part of the Taliban delegation that traveled to Iran in October\n\n200 I to discuss Iran's offer to provide military assistance to the Taliban. See supra Part\n\nIV.B.2.a. The fact that the petitioner was captured at the home of a hardlinc TaUban military\n\ncommander greatly undennines the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated himself\n\nfrom the Taliban prior to his apprehension by Pakistani authorities.

Cir. Mar. 29,2011) (observing that evidence that the petitioner\n\nwas captured in the company of Taliban and al~Qaida fighters in the vicinity of Tora Bora\n\nsupported the conclusion that he was lawfully detained).\n\n       The petitioner's claim that he had resolved to cooperate with U.S. coalition forces prior to\n\nhis capture is also undermined by the evasiveness he exhibited during his discussions with U.S.\n\ninterrogators. According to the government, the earliest known interrogation of the petitioner\n\noccurred                          approximately 3:00 p.m. See Govt's Proposed Findings of Fact\n\n& Conclusions of Law at 82. The interrogator who conducted this inquiry reported that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 76\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   ,\n\f                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n                                                      S!!ClmT\n\n\npetitioner \"attempted to evade questions\" and noted that \"caution should be used when dealing\n\nwith the detainee as he attempts to draw in the interrogator and 'tap dance' around questions.\"\n\nGE 64 (ISN 579 Handnote (Feb. 7,2002) at 1.\n\n       The petitioner's refusal to provide full cooperation has been noted by other interrogators,\n\nwho, as previously noted, have described the petitioner as cunning and evasive. See\n\nPE 34 at 1. The resistance exhibited by the petitioner during these interrogations is not, in the\n\ncourt's view, consistent with the petitioner's claim that he had decided to turn himself in and\n\ncooperate with U.S. coalition forces before he was apprehended in Pakistan.\n\n       In short, the court does not credit the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated\n\nhimself from the Taliban prior to his capture in Chaman, Pakistan. Rather, the weight of the\n\nevidence, especially the fact that he was captured at the home of a senior Taliban official,\n\nindicates that the petitioner remained part ofTaliban forces at the time of his capture.\n\n                            C. Viewing the Totality of the Evidence\n\n       There is no dispute about the basic contours of the petitioner's life. The parties agree that\n\nthe petitioner joined the TaHban in 1994 and became a spokesman and district administrator in\n\nSpin Boldak. He rose through the Taliban ranks and served as a member of the Taliban Supreme\n\nShura, the Taliban's Acting Interior Minister and the Governor of Herat. The petitioner retreated\n\nfrom Herat during Operation Enduring Freedom and that he was ultimately captured by Pakistani\n\nauthorities in Chaman, Pakistan in early 2002.\n\n       The parties have, however, offered two starkly different narratives regarding the\n\npetitioner's tenure with the Taliban. The petitioner contends that he was simply a civilian\n\nbureaucrat who had no involvement with the Taliban's military forces, lost Mullah Omar's trust\n\nover time and eventually broke with him and the Taliban during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\n                                     :t~'~I'\n                                      ,- f\n                                               r\"~\"   ./....   ~\n\n\n\n\n                                                               77\n\n                         UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               ,   .\n\f                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE \n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the government, the petitioner was an experienced military leader who wielded\n\nmilitary authority before and after the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, was a\n\nmember of Mullah Omar's inner circle and remained part of the Taliban even after the time of\n\nhis capture in early 2002.\n\n       Viewed in its totality, the evidence provides more support for the government's narrative.\n\nThe court concludes that the petitioner, like most other senior Taliban leaders, fought with the\n\nAfghan mujahideen in the 19805, and, like other senior Taliban leaders with civilian titles,\n\nparticipated in the Taliban's military efforts to seize control of Afghanistan, serving as a\n\ncommander ofTaliban fighters during the Taliban's assaults on Mazar-e-Sharifin 1997 and\n\n1998. Even after his appointment as Governor of Herat in 1999, the petitioner remained\n\nintegrally involved in the Taliban's military forces, operating within the Taliban's formal\n\ncommand structure and facilitating the movement of Taliban troops both before and after the\n\ncommencement of Operation Enduring Freedom. Moreover, on the eve of Operation Enduring\n\nFreedom, the petitioner was dispatched to Iran by Taliban leaders in Kandahar to discuss Iran's\n\noffer to provide military assistance to the Taliban in anticipation ofthe imminent U.S.-led\n\ninvasion of Afghanistan.\n\n       Throughout his tenure in the Taliban, the petitioner remained a prominent leader and a\n\nclose ally of Mul1ah Omar. The petitioner's ties to Mullah Omar persisted even after a U.S.\n\ncruise missile struck Mullah Omar's vehicle in the early days of Operation Enduring Freedom,\n\nand MuJlah Omar limited his contacts to his most trusted lieutenants, including the petitioner.\n\n       Although the petitioner reached out to Hamid Karzai to discuss the possibility of\n\nsurrender after the commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom, he never turned himself in\n\nand was captured at the home of a senior Taliban official. The evidence, therefore, does not\n\n\n\n\n                                                 78\n                           UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n               I   I\n\f                          UNCLASSIFIEDIIFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n\n                                             SECRE'f\n\nsupport the petitioner's contention that he had disassociated himself from the Taliban by the time\n\nof his capture.\n\n       Based on these considerations, the court concludes that the government has established\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioner was part ofTaliban forces engaged in\n\nhostilities against the United States at the time of his capture. The petitioner is therefore lawfuJly\n\ndetained and his petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be denied.\n\n\n\n                                        v.   CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, the court denies the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
