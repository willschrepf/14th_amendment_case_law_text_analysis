Box 1012\nSomerville, NJ 08876\n\n         COUNSEL FOR SHARON TAXMAN\n                           ___________\n\n                       OPINION OF THE COURT\n                            __________\n\nMANSMANN, Circuit Judge.\n         In this Title VII matter, we must determine whether the\nBoard of Education of the Township of Piscataway violated that\nstatute when it made race a factor in selecting which of two\nequally qualified employees to lay off. Specifically, we must\ndecide whether Title VII permits an employer with a racially\nbalanced work force to grant a non-remedial racial preference in\norder to promote \"racial diversity\".\n         It is clear that the language of Title VII is violated\nwhen an employer makes an employment decision based upon an\nemployee's race. The Supreme Court determined in United\nSteelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), however, that Title\nVII's prohibition against racial discrimination is not violated\nby affirmative action plans which first, \"have purposes that\nmirror those of the statute\" and second, do not \"unnecessarily\ntrammel the interests of the [non-minority] employees,\" id. at\n208.\n         We hold that Piscataway's affirmative action policy is\nunlawful because it fails to satisfy either prong of Weber.\nGiven the clear antidiscrimination mandate of Title VII, a non-\nremedial affirmative action plan, even one with a laudable\npurpose, cannot pass muster. We will affirm the district court's\ngrant of summary judgment to Sharon Taxman.\n\nI.\n\f         In 1975, the Board of Education of the Township of\nPiscataway, New Jersey, developed an affirmative action policy\napplicable to employment decisions. The Board's Affirmative\nAction Program, a 52-page document, was originally adopted in\nresponse to a regulation promulgated by the New Jersey State\nBoard of Education. That regulation directed local school boards\nto adopt \"affirmative action programs,\" N.J. Admin. Code Tit. 6 §\n6:4-1.3(b), to address employment as well as school and classroom\npractices and to ensure equal opportunity to all persons\nregardless of race, color, creed, religion, sex or national\norigin. N.J. Admin. Code Tit. 6 §§ 6:4-1.5, 6:4-1.6(a). In 1983\nthe Board also adopted a one page \"Policy\", entitled \"Affirmative\nAction - Employment Practices.\" It is not clear from the record\nwhether the \"Policy\" superseded or simply added to the \"Program,\"\nnor does it matter for purposes of this appeal.\n         The 1975 document states that the purpose of the\nProgram is \"to provide equal educational opportunity for students\nand equal employment opportunity for employees and prospective\nemployees,\" and \"to make a concentrated effort to attract . . .\nminority personnel for all positions so that their qualifications\ncan be evaluated along with other candidates.\" The 1983 document\nstates that its purpose is to \"ensure[] equal employment\nopportunity . . . and prohibit[] discrimination in employment\nbecause of [,inter alia,] race. . . .\"\n         The operative language regarding the means by which\naffirmative-action goals are to be furthered is identical in the\ntwo documents. \"In all cases, the most qualified candidate will\nbe recommended for appointment. However, when candidates appear\nto be of equal qualification, candidates meeting the criteria of\nthe affirmative action program will be recommended.\" The phrase\n\"candidates meeting the criteria of the affirmative action\nprogram\" refers to members of racial, national origin or gender\ngroups identified as minorities for statistical reporting\npurposes by the New Jersey State Department of Education,\nincluding Blacks. The 1983 document also clarifies that the\naffirmative action program applies to \"every aspect of employment\nincluding . . . layoffs . . . .\"\n         The Board's affirmative action policy did not have \"any\nremedial purpose\"; it was not adopted \"with the intention of\nremedying the results of any prior discrimination or identified\nunderrepresentation of minorities within the Piscataway Public\nSchool System.\" At all relevant times, Black teachers were\nneither \"underrepresented\" nor \"underutilized\" in the Piscataway\nSchool District work force. Indeed, statistics in 1976 and 1985\nshowed that the percentage of Black employees in the job category\nwhich included teachers exceeded the percentage of Blacks in the\navailable work force.\n\n                                A.\n         In May, 1989, the Board accepted a recommendation from\nthe Superintendent of Schools to reduce the teaching staff in the\nBusiness Department at Piscataway High School by one. At that\ntime, two of the teachers in the department were of equal\nseniority, both having begun their employment with the Board on\n\fthe same day nine years earlier. One of those teachers was\nintervenor plaintiff Sharon Taxman, who is White, and the other\nwas Debra Williams, who is Black. Williams was the only minority\nteacher among the faculty of the Business Department.\n         Decisions regarding layoffs by New Jersey school boards\nare highly circumscribed by state law; nontenured faculty must be\nlaid off first, and layoffs among tenured teachers in the\naffected subject area or grade level must proceed in reverse\norder of seniority. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 18A:28-9 et seq.\nSeniority for this purpose is calculated according to specific\nguidelines set by state law. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 18A:28-10; N.J.\nAdmin. Code Tit. 6 § 6:3-5.1. Thus, local boards lack discretion\nto choose between employees for layoff, except in the rare\ninstance of a tie in seniority between the two or more employees\neligible to fill the last remaining position.\n         The Board determined that it was facing just such a\nrare circumstance in deciding between Taxman and Williams. In\nprior decisions involving the layoff of employees with equal\nseniority, the Board had broken the tie through \"a random process\nwhich included drawing numbers out of a container, drawing lots\nor having a lottery.\" In none of those instances, however, had\nthe employees involved been of different races.\n         In light of the unique posture of the layoff decision,\nSuperintendent of Schools Burton Edelchick recommended to the\nBoard that the affirmative action plan be invoked in order to\ndetermine which teacher to retain. Superintendent Edelchick made\nthis recommendation \"because he believed Ms. Williams and Ms.\nTaxman were tied in seniority, were equally qualified, and\nbecause Ms. Williams was the only Black teacher in the Business\nEducation Department.\"\n         While the Board recognized that it was not bound to\napply the affirmative action policy, it made a discretionary\ndecision to invoke the policy to break the tie between Williams\nand Taxman. As a result, the Board \"voted to terminate the\nemployment of Sharon Taxman, effective June 30, 1988. . . .\"\n         At her deposition, Paula Van Riper, the Board's Vice\nPresident at the time of the layoff, described the Board's\ndecision-making process. According to Van Riper, after the Board\nrecognized that Taxman and Williams were of equal seniority, it\nassessed their classroom performance, evaluations, volunteerism\nand certifications and determined that they were \"two teachers of\nequal ability\" and \"equal qualifications.\"\n         At his deposition Theodore H. Kruse, the Board's\nPresident, explained his vote to apply the affirmative action\npolicy as follows:\n         A.   Basically I think because I had been\n         aware that the student body and the community\n         which is our responsibility, the schools of\n         the community, is really quite diverse and\n         there -- I have a general feeling during my\n         tenure on the board that it was valuable for\n         the students to see in the various employment\n         roles a wide range of background, and that it\n         was also valuable to the work force and in\n\f         particular to the teaching staff that they\n         have -- they see that in each other.\n         Asked to articulate the \"educational objective\" served\nby retaining Williams rather than Taxman, Kruse stated:\n         A.   In my own personal perspective I believe\n         by retaining Mrs. Williams it was sending a\n         very clear message that we feel that our\n         staff should be culturally diverse, our\n         student population is culturally diverse and\n         there is a distinct advantage to students, to\n         all students, to be made -- come into contact\n         with people of different cultures, different\n         background, so that they are more aware, more\n         tolerant, more accepting, more understanding\n         of people of all background.\n\n         Q.   What do you mean by the phrase you used,\n         culturally diverse?\n\n         A.   Someone other than -- different than\n         yourself. And we have, our student\n         population and our community has people of\n         all different background, ethnic background,\n         religious background, cultural background,\n         and it's important that our school district\n         encourage awareness and acceptance and\n         tolerance and, therefore, I personally think\n         it's important that our staff reflect that\n         too.\n\n                                B.\n         Following the Board's decision, Taxman filed a charge\nof employment discrimination with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission. Attempts at conciliation were\nunsuccessful, and the United States filed suit under Title VII\nagainst the Board in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of New Jersey. Taxman intervened, asserting claims\nunder both Title VII and the New Jersey Law Against\nDiscrimination (NJLAD).\n         Following discovery, the Board moved for summary\njudgment and the United States and Taxman cross-moved for partial\nsummary judgment only as to liability. The district court denied\nthe Board's motion and granted partial summary judgment to the\nUnited States and Taxman, holding the Board liable under both\nstatutes for discrimination on the basis of race. United States\nv. Board of Educ. of Township Piscataway, 832 F. Supp. 836, 851\n(D.N.J. 1993).\n         A trial proceeded on the issue of damages. By this\ntime, Taxman had been rehired by the Board and thus her\nreinstatement was not an issue. The court awarded Taxman damages\nin the amount of $134,014.62 for backpay, fringe benefits and\nprejudgment interest under Title VII. A jury awarded an\nadditional $10,000 for emotional suffering under the NJLAD. The\ndistrict court denied the United States' request for a broadly\n\fworded injunction against future discrimination, finding that\nthere was no likelihood that the conduct at issue would recur,\nbut it did order the Board to give Taxman full seniority\nreflecting continuous employment from 1980. Additionally, the\ncourt dismissed Taxman's claim for punitive damages under the\nNJLAD.\n         The Board appealed, contending that the district court\nerred in granting Taxman summary judgment as to liability. The\nBoard also contends, in the alternative, that the court erred in\nawarding Taxman 100% backpay and in awarding prejudgment interest\nat the IRS rate rather than under 28 U.S.C. § 1961. Taxman\ncross-appealed, contending that the district court erred in\ndismissing her claim for punitive damages. Subsequently, the\nUnited States sought leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in\nsupport of reversal of the judgment, representing that it could\nno longer support the judgment of the district court. By order\nof November 17, 1995, we denied the United States' request. We\ntreated the position of the United States at the original\nargument before this court on January 24, 1995, as a motion to\nwithdraw as a party, which we granted. Thus, the only parties\nbefore us on this appeal are the Board and Taxman.\n         This court has jurisdiction over the appeals under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the district court's decision on\nsummary judgment is plenary. Waldron v. SL Industries, 56 F.3d\n491, 496 (3d Cir. 1995).\n\n                               II.\n         In relevant part, Title VII makes it unlawful for an\nemployer \"to discriminate against any individual with respect to\nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\"\nor \"to limit, segregate, or classify his employees . . . in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\nemployment opportunities or otherwise affect his status as an\nemployee\" on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.\" 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). For a time, the\nSupreme Court construed this language as absolutely prohibiting\ndiscrimination in employment, neither requiring nor permitting\nany preference for any group. Johnson v. Transportation Agency,\nSanta Clara County, 480 U.S. 616, 643 (1987) (Stevens, J.,\nconcurring) (citing, inter alia, Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401\nU.S. 424, 431 (1971), and McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co.,\n427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976)).\n         In 1979, however, the Court interpreted the statute's\n\"antidiscriminatory strategy\" in a \"fundamentally different way\",\nid. at 644, holding in the seminal case of United Steelworkers v.\nWeber, 433 U.S. 193 (1979), that Title VII's prohibition against\nracial discrimination does not condemn all voluntary race-\nconscious affirmative action plans. In Weber, the Court\nconsidered a plan implemented by Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical\nCorporation. Prior to 1974, Kaiser hired as craftworkers only\nthose with prior craft experience. Id. at 198. Because they had\nlong been excluded from craft unions, Blacks were unable to\npresent the credentials required for craft positions. Id.\nMoreover, Kaiser's hiring practices, although not admittedly\n\fdiscriminatory with regard to minorities, were questionable. Id.at 210.\nAs a consequence, while the local labor force was about\n39% Black, Kaiser's labor force was less than 15% Black and its\ncrafts-work force was less than 2% Black. Id. at 198. In 1974,\nKaiser entered into a collective bargaining agreement which\ncontained an affirmative action plan. The plan reserved 50% of\nthe openings in an in-plant craft-training program for Black\nemployees until the percentage of Black craft-workers in the\nplant reached a level commensurate with the percentage of Blacks\nin the local labor force. Id. at 198. During the first year of\nthe plan's operation, 13 craft-trainees were selected, seven of\nwhom were Black and six of whom were White. Id. at 199.\n         Thereafter, Brian Weber, a White production worker,\nfiled a class action suit, alleging that the plan unlawfully\ndiscriminated against White employees under Title VII. Relying\nupon a literal reading of subsections 2000-3(2)(a) and (d) of\nthe Act, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-2(a), (d), and upon the Court's\ndecision in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. at\n273, where the Court held that Title VII forbids discrimination\nagainst Whites as well as Blacks, the plaintiffs argued that it\nnecessarily followed that the Kaiser plan, which resulted in\njunior Black employees receiving craft training in preference to\nsenior White employees, violated Title VII. Id. at 199. The\ndistrict court agreed and entered a judgment in favor of the\nplaintiffs; the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nId. at 200.\n         The Supreme Court, however, reversed, noting initially\nthat although the plaintiffs' argument was not \"without force\",\nit disregarded \"the significance of the fact that the Kaiser-USWA\nplan was an affirmative action plan voluntarily adopted by\nprivate parties to eliminate traditional patterns of racial\nsegregation.\" Id. at 201. The Court then embarked upon an\nexhaustive review of Title VII's legislative history and\nidentified Congress' concerns in enacting Title VII's prohibition\nagainst discrimination -- the deplorable status of Blacks in the\nnation's economy, racial injustice, and the need to open\nemployment opportunities for Blacks in traditionally closed\noccupations. Id. at 202-204. Against this background, the Court\nconcluded that Congress could not have intended to prohibit\nprivate employers from implementing programs directed toward the\nvery goal of Title VII -- the eradication of discrimination and\nits effects from the workplace:\n         It would be ironic indeed if a law triggered\n         by a Nation's concern over centuries of\n         racial injustice and intended to improve the\n         lot of those who had \"been excluded from the\n         American dream for so long,\" 110 Cong. Rec.\n         6552 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey),\n         constituted the first legislative prohibition\n         of all voluntary, private, race-conscious\n         efforts to abolish traditional patterns of\n         racial segregation and hierarchy.\n\nId. at 204.\n\f         The Court found support for its conclusion in the\nlanguage and legislative history of section 2000e-2(j) of Title\nVII which expressly provides that nothing in the Act requires\nemployers to grant racial preferences. According to the Court,\nthe opponents of Title VII had raised two arguments: the Act\nwould be construed to impose obligations upon employers to\nintegrate their work forces through preferential treatment of\nminorities, and even without being obligated to do so, employers\nwith racially imbalanced work forces would grant racial\npreferences. Id. at 205. Since Congress addressed only the\nfirst objection and did not specifically prohibit affirmative\naction efforts in section 2000e-2(j), the Court inferred that\nCongress did not intend that Title VII forbid all voluntary race-\nconscious preferences. Id. at 205-06. The Court further\nreasoned that since Congress also intended in section 2000e-2(j)\n\"to avoid undue federal regulation of private businesses,\" a\nprohibition against all voluntary affirmative action would\ndisserve this end by \"augment[ing] the power of the Federal\ngovernment and diminish[ing] traditional management prerogatives.\n. . .\" Id. at 206-07.\n         The Court then turned to the Kaiser plan in order to\ndetermine whether it fell on the \"permissible\" side of the \"line\nof demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative\naction plans.\" Id. at 208. The Court upheld the Kaiser plan\nbecause its purpose \"mirror[ed] those of the statute\" and it did\nnot \"unnecessarily trammel the interests of the [non-minority]\nemployees\":\n         The purposes of the plan mirror those of the\n         statute. Both were designed to break down\n         old patterns of racial segregation and\n         hierarchy. Both were structured to \"open\n         employment opportunities for Negroes in\n         occupations which have been traditionally\n         closed to them.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964)\n         (remarks of Sen. Humphrey).\n\n              At the same time, the plan does not\n         unnecessarily trammel the interests of the\n         white employees. The plan does not require\n         the discharge of white workers and their\n         replacement with new black hires. Nor does\n         the plan create an absolute bar to the\n         advancement of white employees; half of those\n         trained in the program will be white.\n         Moreover, the plan is a temporary measure; it\n         is not intended to maintain racial balance,\n         but simply to eliminate a manifest racial\n         imbalance.\n\nId. at 208 (citation and footnote omitted).\n         In 1987, the Supreme Court decided a second Title VII\naffirmative action case, Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa\nClara County, 480 U.S. at 616. There, the Santa Clara County\nTransit District Board of Supervisors implemented an affirmative\n\faction plan stating that \"`mere prohibition of discriminatory\npractices [was] not enough to remedy the effects of past\ndiscriminatory practices and to permit attainment of an equitable\nrepresentation of minorities, women and handicapped persons.'\"\nId. at 620. The plan noted that women were represented in\nnumbers far less than their proportion of the available work\nforce in the Agency as a whole and in the skilled craft worker\njob category relevant to the case, and observed that a lack of\nmotivation in women to seek training or employment where\nopportunities were limited partially explained the\nunderrepresentation. Id. at 621. The plan authorized the Agency\nto consider as one factor the gender of a qualified candidate in\nmaking promotions to positions with a traditionally segregated\njob classification in which women were significantly\nunderrepresented. Id. at 620-21. The plan did not set quotas,\nbut had as its long-term goal the attainment of a work force\nwhose composition reflected the proportion of women in the area\nlabor force. Id. at 621-22. Acknowledging the practical\ndifficulties in attaining the long-term goal, including the\nlimited number of qualified women, the plan counseled that short-\nrange goals be established and annually adjusted to serve as\nrealistic guides for actual employment decisions. Id. at 622.\n         On December 12, 1979, the Agency announced a vacancy\nfor the promotional position of road dispatcher. At the time,\nnone of the 238 positions in the applicable job category was\noccupied by a woman. Id. at 621. The Agency Director,\nauthorized to choose any of seven applicants who had been deemed\neligible, promoted Diane Joyce, a qualified woman, over Paul\nJohnson, a qualified man. Id. at 624-25. As the Agency Director\ntestified: \"`I tried to look at the whole picture, the\ncombination of her qualifications and Mr. Johnson's\nqualifications, their test scores, their expertise, their\nbackground, affirmative action matters, things like that . . . I\nbelieve it was a combination of all those.'\" Id. at 625.\n         Johnson sued, alleging that the Agency's employment\ndecision constituted unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII.\nEvaluating the plan against the criteria announced in Weber, the\ndistrict court held that the plan did not satisfy Weber's\ncriterion that the plan be temporary. Id. at 625. The Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that since the\nplan provided for the attainment, rather than the maintenance, of\na balanced work force, the absence of an express termination date\nin the plan was not dispositive of its validity. Id. at 625-26.\nThe court of appeals further held that the plan had been adopted\n\"to address a conspicuous imbalance in the Agency's work force,\nand neither unnecessarily trammeled the rights of other\nemployees, nor created an absolute bar to their advancement.\"\nId. at 626.\n         The Supreme Court affirmed. Declaring its prior\nanalysis in Weber controlling, the Court examined whether the\nemployment decision at issue \"was made pursuant to a plan\nprompted by concerns similar to those of the employer in Weber\"\nand whether \"the effect of the [p]lan on males and nonminorities\n\f[was] comparable to the effects of the plan in that case.\" Id.at 631.\nThe first issue the Court addressed, therefore, was\nwhether \"consideration of the sex of applicants for Skilled Craft\njobs was justified by the existence of a `manifest imbalance'\nthat reflected underrepresentation of women in `traditionally\nsegregated job categories.'\" Id. at 631 (quoting Weber, 433 U.S.\nat 197). Although the Court did not set forth a quantitative\nmeasure for determining what degree of disproportionate\nrepresentation in an employer's work force would be sufficient to\njustify affirmative action, it made clear that the terms\n\"manifest imbalance\" and \"traditionally segregated job category\"\nwere not tantamount to a prima facie case of discrimination\nagainst an employer since the constraints of Title VII and the\nFederal Constitution on voluntarily adopted affirmative action\nplans are not identical. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632. In this\nregard, the Court further reasoned that requiring an employer in\na Title VII affirmative action case to show that it had\ndiscriminated in the past \"would be inconsistent with Weber's\nfocus on statistical imbalance, and could inappropriately create\na significant discentive for employers to adopt an affirmative\naction plan\". Id. at 633 (footnote omitted).\n         Reviewing Agency statistics which showed that women\nwere concentrated in traditionally female jobs and represented a\nlower percentage in other jobs than would be expected if\ntraditional segregation had not occurred, the Court concluded\nthat the decision to promote Joyce was made pursuant to a plan\ndesigned to eliminate work force imbalances in traditionally\nsegregated job categories and thus satisfied Weber's first prong.\nId. at 634. Moving to Weber's second prong, whether the plan\nunnecessarily trammeled the rights of male employees, the Court\nconcluded that the plan passed muster because it authorized\nmerely that consideration be given to affirmative action concerns\nwhen evaluating applicants; gender was a \"plus\" factor, only one\nof several criteria that the Agency Director considered in making\nhis decision; no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on the\npart of Johnson was denied since the Agency Director could have\npromoted any of the seven candidates classified as eligible; even\nthough Johnson was refused a promotion, he retained his\nemployment; and the plan was intended to attain a balanced work\nforce, not to maintain one. Id. at 638-40.\n\n                               III.\n         We analyze Taxman's claim of employment discrimination\nunder the approach set forth in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, 411\nU.S. 792 (1978). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima faciecase, the\nburden of production shifts to the employer to show a\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the decision; an\naffirmative action plan may be one such reason. Johnson v.\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616, 626\n(1987). When the employer satisfies this requirement, the burden\nof production shifts back to the employee to show that the\nasserted nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext and that the\naffirmative action plan is invalid. Id.\n         For summary judgment purposes, the parties do not\n\fdispute that Taxman has established a prima facie case or that\nthe Board's decision to terminate her was based on its\naffirmative action policy. The dispositive liability issue,\ntherefore, is the validity of the Board's policy under Title VII.\n\n                               IV.\n         Having reviewed the analytical framework for assessing\nthe validity of an affirmative action plan as established in\nUnited Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), and refined in\nJohnson, 490 U.S. at 616, we turn to the facts of this case in\norder to determine whether the racial diversity purpose of the\nBoard's policy mirrors the purposes of the statute. We look for\nthe purposes of Title VII in the plain meaning of the Act's\nprovisions and in its legislative history and historical context.\nSee Edward v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 594-95 (1987) (in\ndetermining a statute's purpose, courts look to the statute's\nwords, legislative history, historical context and the sequence\nof events leading to its passage).\n\n                                A.\n         Title VII was enacted to further two primary goals: to\nend discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or\nnational origin, thereby guaranteeing equal opportunity in the\nworkplace, and to remedy the segregation and underrepresentation\nof minorities that discrimination has caused in our Nation's work\nforce.\n         Title VII's first purpose is set forth in section\n2000e-2's several prohibitions, which expressly denounce the\ndiscrimination which Congress sought to end. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a)-(d),(l); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 800 (\"The language\nof Title VII makes plain the purpose of Congress to assure\nequality of employment opportunities and to eliminate those\ndiscriminatory practices and devices which have fostered racially\nstratified job environments to the disadvantage of minority\ncitizens.\").            This antidiscriminatory purpose is also reflected\nin the Act's legislative history. In an interpretative\nmemorandum entered into the Congressional Record, Senators Case\nand Clark, comanagers of the Senate bill, stated:\n         To discriminate is to make a distinction, to\n         make a difference in treatment or favor, and\n         those distinctions or differences in\n         treatment or favor which are prohibited by\n         section 704 are those which are based on any\n         five of the forbidden criteria: race, color,\n         religion, sex, and national origin. Any\n         other criterion or qualification for\n         employment is not affected by this title.\n\n                              * * *\n\n         . . . [Title VII] expressly protects the\n         employer's right to insist that any\n         prospective applicant, Negro or white, must\n         meet the applicable job qualifications.\n\f         Indeed the very purpose of Title VII is to\n         promote hiring on the basis of job\n         qualifications, rather than on the basis of\n         race or color.\n\n110 Cong. Rec. 7213, 7247 (1964), quoted in Price Waterhouse v.\nHopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 243 (1989).\n         Title VII's second purpose, ending the segregative\neffects of discrimination, is revealed in the congressional\ndebate surrounding the statute's enactment. In Weber, the Court\ncarefully catalogued the comments made by the proponents of Title\nVII which demonstrate the Act's remedial concerns. Weber, 433\nU.S. at 202-04. By way of illustration, we cite Senator Clark's\nremarks to the Senate:\n         The rate of Negro unemployment has gone up\n         consistently as compared with white\n         unemployment for the past 15 years. This is\n         a social malaise and a social situation which\n         we should not tolerate. That is one of the\n         principal reasons why the bill should pass.\n\nId. (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. at 7220) (statement of Sen. Clark).\nLikewise, Senator Humphrey spoke of the Nation's need \"`to open\nemployment opportunities for Negroes which have been\ntraditionally closed to them,'\" and to assist those who have\n\"`been excluded from the American dream for so long[.]'\" Id.(quoting 110\nCong. Rec. at 6548, 6552) (statements of Sen.\nHumphrey).\n         The significance of this second corrective purpose\ncannot be overstated. It is only because Title VII was written\nto eradicate not only discrimination per se but the consequencesof prior\ndiscrimination as well, that racial preferences in the\nform of affirmative action can co-exist with the Act's\nantidiscrimination mandate.\n         Thus, based on our analysis of Title VII's two goals,\nwe are convinced that unless an affirmative action plan has a\nremedial purpose, it cannot be said to mirror the purposes of the\nstatute, and, therefore, cannot satisfy the first prong of the\nWeber test.\n         We see this case as one involving straightforward\nstatutory interpretation controlled by the text and legislative\nhistory of Title VII as interpreted in Weber and Johnson. The\nstatute on its face provides that race cannot be a factor in\nemployer decisions about hires, promotions, and layoffs, and the\nlegislative history demonstrates that barring considerations of\nrace from the workplace was Congress' primary objective. If\nexceptions to this bar are to be made, they must be made on the\nbasis of what Congress has said. The affirmative action plans at\nissue in Weber and Johnson were sustained only because the\nSupreme Court, examining those plans in light of congressional\nintent, found a secondary congressional objective in Title VII\nthat had to be accommodated -- i.e., the elimination of the\neffects of past discrimination in the workplace. Here, there is\nno congressional recognition of diversity as a Title VII\n\fobjective requiring accommodation.\n         Accordingly, it is beyond cavil that the Board, by\ninvoking its affirmative action policy to lay off Sharon Taxman,\nviolated the terms of Title VII. While the Court in Weber and\nJohnson permitted some deviation from the antidiscrimination\nmandate of the statute in order to erase the effects of past\ndiscrimination, these rulings do not open the door to additional\nnon-remedial deviations. Here, as in Weber and Johnson, the\nBoard must justify its deviation from the statutory mandate based\non positive legislative history, not on its idea of what is\nappropriate.\n\n                                B.\n         The Board recognizes that there is no positive\nlegislative history supporting its goal of promoting racial\ndiversity \"for education's sake\", and concedes that there is no\ncaselaw approving such a purpose to support an affirmative action\nplan under Title VII. \"[T]he Board would have [us] infer the\npropriety of this purpose from fragments of other authority.\"\nBoard of Educ. of Township of Piscataway, 832 F. Supp. at 845.\n         The Board first attempts to meet its obligations with\nrespect to Title VII by arguing that Congress meant to cover the\nsituation presented here \"when it amended Title VII in 1972 to\ncover academic institutions public and private.\" A review of a\nSenate Committee's explanation for recommending the amendment,\nhowever, reveals that Congress neither addressed nor embraced the\nracial diversity purpose before us. Instead, Congress pursued,\nin Title VII's 1972 amendment with regard to the nation's\nschools, the same purposes it had pursued in 1964 when enacting\nthe original statute with respect to other employers, namely, the\nelimination of discriminatory employment practices and the\nabolition of discrimination's invidious effects:\n              The presence of discrimination in the\n         Nation's educational institutions is no\n         secret. . . . This discrimination, however,\n         is not limited to the students alone.\n         Discriminatory practices against faculty,\n         staff, and other employees is also common.\n\n              As in other areas of employment,\n         statistics for educational institutions\n         indicate that minorities and women are\n         precluded from the more prestigious and\n         higher-paying positions, and are relegated to\n         the more menial and lower-paying jobs. While\n         in elementary and secondary school systems\n         Negroes accounted for approximately 10% of\n         the total number of positions in the higher-\n         paying and more prestigious positions in\n         institutions of higher learning, blacks\n         constituted only 2.2% of all positions, most\n         of these being found in all-black or\n         predominantly black institutions. Women are\n         similarly subject to discriminatory patterns.\n\f         Not only are they generally under-represented\n         in institutions of higher learning, but those\n         few that do obtain positions are generally\n         paid less and advanced more slowly than their\n         male counterparts. Similarly, while women\n         constitute 67% of elementary and secondary\n         school teachers, out of 778,000 elementary\n         and secondary school principals, 78% of\n         elementary school principals are men and 94%\n         of secondary school principals are men.\n\n              . . . There is nothing in the\n         legislative background of Title VII, nor does\n         any national policy suggest itself, to\n         support the present exemption. In fact, the\n         Committee believes that the existence of\n         discrimination in educational institutions is\n         particularly critical. It is difficult to\n         imagine a more sensitive area than\n         educational institutions, where the youth of\n         the Nation are exposed to a multitude of\n         ideas and impressions that will strongly\n         influence their future development. To\n         permit discrimination here would, more than\n         in any other area, tend to promote existing\n         misconceptions and stereotypical\n         categorizations which in turn would lead to\n         future patterns of discrimination.\n\nS.Rep. 415, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1971). See Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 627-28 n.6 (\"While public employers were not added to the\ndefinition of `employer' in Title VII until 1972, there is no\nevidence that this mere addition to the definitional section of\nthe statute was intended to transform the substantive standard\ngoverning employer conduct.\").\n         We find the Board's reliance on Fourteenth Amendment\ncaselaw misplaced as well. We are acutely aware, as is the\nBoard, that the federal courts have never decided a \"pure\" Title\nVII case where racial diversity for education's sake was advanced\nas the sole justification for a race-based decision. The Board\nargues that in deciding just such a case, we should look to the\nSupreme Court's endorsement of diversity as a goal in the Equal\nProtection context. This argument, however, is based upon a\nfaulty premise.\n         In relying on Equal Protection cases to support its\ndiversity goal, we understand the Board to reason as follows:\nThe Supreme Court observed in Johnson that \"the statutory\nprohibition [in Title VII] with which an employer must contend\nwas not intended to extend as far as that of the Constitution\",\n480 U.S. at 628 n.6. Accordingly, a purpose which survives\nconstitutional strict scrutiny necessarily passes muster under\nTitle VII's permissible purpose test -- since the Court has\nendorsed the concept of diversity in Equal Protection cases, it\nwould approve the Board's diversity purpose in this Title VII\n\fcase, where the limitations on purpose are less stringent.\n         We are convinced, however, that Johnson's footnote six,\n480 U.S. at 627-28 n.6, in which the Court contrasted the reach\nof Title VII with that of the Constitution, does not speak to the\npurposes that may support affirmative action under the former but\nnot the latter. We read the Court's observation to relate,\ninstead, to the factual predicate that employers must offer to\nprove the need for remedial efforts in Title VII as contrasted\nwith Equal Protection affirmative action cases.\n         In Johnson, the Court held that the legality of the\nSanta Clara County Transportation Agency's plan under Title VII\nmust be guided by the Court's determination in Weber that\naffirmative action is lawful if an employer can point to a\n\"`manifest imbalance . . . in traditionally segregated job\ncategories.'\" 480 U.S. at 630-32 (quoting Weber, 433 U.S. at\n197). In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267\n(1986), by contrast, the Court determined that under the\nConstitution a public employer's remedial affirmative action\ninitiatives are valid only if crafted to remedy its own past or\npresent discrimination; that is, societal discrimination is an\ninsufficient basis for \"imposing discretionary legal remedies\nagainst innocent people.\" Id. at 274-76. In the plurality's\nwords, affirmative action must be supported by \"a factual\ndetermination that the employer had a strong basis in evidence\nfor its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\" Id. at\n277.\n         When the Court in Johnson observed that Title VII's\nstatutory prohibition does not extend as far as the Constitution,\nit was addressing one of Justice Scalia's arguments in dissent\nthat since obligations under Title VII and the Constitution are\nidentical, a public employer's adoption of an affirmative action\nplan in a Title VII case should be governed by the prior\ndiscrimination standard set forth in Wygant. Johnson, 480 U.S.\nat 627-28 n.6.\n\n         While the Supreme Court may indeed at some future date\nhold that an affirmative action purpose that satisfies the\nConstitution must necessarily satisfy Title VII, it has yet to do\nso.\n         Were we to accept that equal protection standards may\nbe imported into Title VII analysis, we are still unpersuaded\nthat the Equal Protection caselaw validates the Board's asserted\ngoal of racial diversity. We cannot agree with the Board that\nthe racial diversity purpose is supported by both the Supreme\nCourt's holding and the dissenting opinions in Wygant. The Court\nin Wygant, although divided, agreed that under the Equal\nProtection Clause, racial classifications in the context of\naffirmative action must be justified by a compelling state\npurpose and the means chosen to effectuate that purpose must be\nnarrowly tailored; that societal discrimination alone will not\njustify a racial classification; that evidence of prior\ndiscrimination by an employer must be presented before remedial\nracial classifications can be employed; and that the \"role model\"\ntheory proposed by the employer as a basis for race-conscious\n\fstate action was unacceptable because it would have allowed\ndiscriminatory hiring and layoff well beyond the point necessary\nfor any remedial purpose and did not bear any relationship to the\nharm caused by prior discrimination. Id. at 270-78; id. at 284-\n93 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\nCourt's judgment); id. at 294-95 (White, J., concurring in the\nCourt's judgment). The dissenting Justices believed that the\nConstitution would allow a public employer to preserve the\nintegration it had achieved through a legitimate affirmative\naction hiring plan by thereafter apportioning layoffs between\nminority and nonminority groups. Id. at 306 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting, joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.); id. at 267-68\n(Stevens, J., dissenting).\n         We are also unpersuaded by the Board's contention that\nEqual Protection cases arising in an education context support\nupholding the Board's purpose in a Title VII action. These Equal\nProtection cases, unlike the case at hand, involved corrective\nefforts to confront racial segregation or chronic minority\nunderrepresentation in the schools. In this context, we are not\nat all surprised that the goal of diversity was raised. While we\nwholeheartedly endorse any statements in these cases extolling\nthe educational value of exposing students to persons of diverse\nraces and backgrounds, given the framework in which they were\nmade, we cannot accept them as authority for the conclusion that\nthe Board's non-remedial racial diversity goal is a permissible\nbasis for affirmative action under Title VII. See, e.g., Wygant,\n476 U.S. at 267 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting that the\nracially-conscious layoff provision at issue was aimed at\npreserving the faculty integration achieved by the Jackson,\nMichigan Public Schools in the early 1970s through affirmative\naction; minority representation went from 3.9% in 1969 to 8.8% in\n1971); Columbus Board of Education v. Penick, 443 U.S. 449, 467\n(1979) (condemning intentional segregation and the creation of\nracially-identifiable schools practiced by the Columbus, Ohio\nBoard of Education); Regents of the University of California v.\nBakke, 438 U.S. 265, 272 (1978) (Powell, J., announcing the\njudgment of the Court) (observing that the 1968 class of the\nMedical School of the University of California at Davis contained\nthree Asians, no Blacks, no Mexican-Americans and no American\nIndians); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402\nU.S. 1 (1971) (observing that 14,000 Black pupils in the\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina school system attended 21\nschools that were at least 99% Black); Kromnick v. School Dist.\nof Philadelphia, 739 F.2d 894, 897 (3d Cir. 1984) (recognizing\nthat \"[t]he Philadelphia School System has long suffered from defacto\nsegregation by race of students and faculty\"), cert.denied, 469 U.S. 1107\n(1985).\n         More specifically, two Supreme Court cases upon which\nthe Board relies, Bakke, 438 U.S. at 265, and Metro Broadcasting\nInc. v. FCC, 497 U.S. 547 (1990), are inapposite. Bakke involved\na rejected White applicant's challenge under the Constitution and\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, to a\nspecial admissions program instituted by the Medical School of\nthe University of California at Davis which essentially set aside\n\f16 places for minority candidates. Justice Powell, whose vote\nwas necessary both to establish the validity of considering race\nin admission decisions and to invalidate the racial quota before\nthe Court, was of the opinion that the attainment of a \"diverse\nstudent body\" is a constitutionally permissible goal for an\ninstitution of higher education. Justice Powell pointed out that\nthe academic freedom that has been viewed as a \"special concern\"\nof the First Amendment includes \"the freedom of a university to\nmake its own judgments as to the selection of its student body\"\nand that \"[t]he atmosphere of `speculation, experiment and\ncreation' -- so essential to the quality of higher education --\nis widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body.\"\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (footnote omitted). He then agreed with\nDavis' assertion that its interest in diversity implicated First\nAmendment concerns:\n              Thus, in arguing that its universities\n         must be accorded the right to select those\n         students who will contribute the most to the\n         \"robust exchange of ideas,\" [Davis] invokes a\n         countervailing constitutional interest, that\n         of the First Amendment. In this light,\n         petitioner must be viewed as seeking to\n         achieve a goal that is of paramount\n         importance in the fulfillment of its mission.\n\nId. at 313.\n         Davis' reservation of a specified number of seats in\neach class for individuals from preferred ethnic groups to\nfurther its diversity purpose, however, was unacceptable because,\naccording to Justice Powell, it misconceived the nature of the\nstate interest that would justify consideration of race or ethnic\nbackground:\n         It is not an interest in simple ethnic\n         diversity, in which a specified percentage of\n         the student body is in effect guaranteed to\n         be members of selected ethnic groups, with\n         the remaining percentage an undifferentiated\n         aggregation of students. The diversity that\n         furthers a compelling state interest\n         encompasses a far broader array of\n         qualifications and characteristics of which\n         racial or ethnic origin is but a single\n         though important element. Davis' special\n         admissions program, focused solely on ethnic\n         diversity, would hinder rather than further\n         attainment of genuine diversity.\n\nId. at 315 (footnote omitted).\n         Bakke's factual and legal setting, as well as the\ndiversity that universities aspire to in their student bodies,\nare, in our view, so different from the facts, relevant law and\nthe racial diversity purpose involved in this case that we find\nlittle in Bakke to guide us.\n         Likewise, statements regarding the value of programming\n\fdiversity made by the Court in Metro Broadcasting when it upheld\ntwo minority preference policies adopted by the Federal\nCommunications Commission, 497 U.S. at 547, have no application\nhere. The diversity interest the Court found sufficient under\nthe Constitution to support a racial classification had nothing\nwhatsoever to do with the concerns that underlie Title VII.\nCiting Bakke, the Court concluded that \"[j]ust as a `diverse\nstudent body' contributing to a `robust exchange of ideas' is a\n`constitutionally permissible goal' on which a race-conscious\nuniversity admissions program may be predicated, the diversity of\nviews and information on the airwaves serves important First\nAmendment values.\" Id. at 568 (citation omitted).\n         Finally, we turn to the Board's argument that the\ndiversity goal underlying its application of the affirmative\naction policy was endorsed in Justice O'Connor's concurring\nopinion in Wygant and in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in\nJohnson. We find that these statements are slender reeds indeed\nand any bearing that they may have in the situation presented\nhere is minimal. While Justice O'Connor did refer favorably to\nBakke and the notion of racial diversity in institutions of\nhigher learning, Wygant, 480 U.S. at 286 (O'Connor J.\nconcurring), just one year later in Johnson, a Title VII case,\nshe rejected Justice Steven's expansive view of the purposes that\nmay underlie affirmative action, stating: \"[C]ontrary to the\nintimations in JUSTICE STEVENS' concurrence, this Court did not\napprove preferences for minorities `for any reason that might\nseem sensible from a business or social point of view.'\"\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 649 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the Court's\njudgment). As for Justice Stevens' concurrence in Johnson, while\nhe clearly pondered the idea of \"forward-looking\" affirmative\naction where employers do not focus on \"`purg[ing] their own past\nsins of discrimination'\", id. at 647 (Stevens, J., concurring),\nhis comments are not controlling.\n\n                                V.\n         Since we have not found anything in the Board's\narguments to convince us that this case requires examination\nbeyond statutory interpretation, we return to the point at which\nwe started: the language of Title VII itself and the two cases\nreviewing affirmative action plans in light of that statute. Our\nanalysis of the statute and the caselaw convinces us that a non-\nremedial affirmative action plan cannot form the basis for\ndeviating from the antidiscrimination mandate of Title VII.\n         The Board admits that it did not act to remedy the\neffects of past employment discrimination. The parties have\nstipulated that neither the Board's adoption of its affirmative\naction policy nor its subsequent decision to apply it in choosing\nbetween Taxman and Williams was intended to remedy the results of\nany prior discrimination or identified underrepresentation of\nBlacks within the Piscataway School District's teacher workforce\nas a whole. Nor does the Board contend that its action here was\ndirected at remedying any de jure or de facto segregation. Butsee\nPiscataway Township Bd. of Educ. v. Burke, 386 A.2d 439 (N.J.\nSuper. Ct. App. Div.), appeal dismissed, 401 A.2d 230 (N.J.\n\f1978). Even though the Board's race-conscious action was taken\nto avoid what could have been an all-White faculty within the\nBusiness Department, the Board concedes that Blacks are not\nunderrepresented in its teaching workforce as a whole or even in\nthe Piscataway High School.\n         Rather, the Board's sole purpose in applying its\naffirmative action policy in this case was to obtain an\neducational benefit which it believed would result from a\nracially diverse faculty. While the benefits flowing from\ndiversity in the educational context are significant indeed, we\nare constrained to hold, as did the district court, that inasmuch\nas \"the Board does not even attempt to show that its affirmative\naction plan was adopted to remedy past discrimination or as the\nresult of a manifest imbalance in the employment of minorities,\"\n832 F. Supp. at 845, the Board has failed to satisfy the first\nprong of the Weber test. United States v. Board of Educ. of\nTownship of Piscataway, 832 F. Supp. 836, 848 (D.N.J. 1993).\n         We turn next to the second prong of the Weber analysis.\nThis second prong requires that we determine whether the Board's\npolicy \"unnecessarily trammel[s] . . . [nonminority] interests.\n. . .\" Weber, 433 U.S. at 208. Under this requirement, too, the\nBoard's policy is deficient.\n         We begin by noting the policy's utter lack of\ndefinition and structure. While it is not for us to decide how\nmuch diversity in a high school facility is \"enough,\" the Board\ncannot abdicate its responsibility to define \"racial diversity\"\nand to determine what degree of racial diversity in the\nPiscataway School is sufficient.\n         The affirmative action plans that have met with the\nSupreme Court's approval under Title VII had objectives, as well\nas benchmarks which served to evaluate progress, guide the\nemployment decisions at issue and assure the grant of only those\nminority preferences necessary to further the plans' purpose.\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 621-22 (setting forth long-range and short-\nterm objectives to achieve \"`a statistically measurable yearly\nimprovement in hiring, training and promotion of minorities and\nwomen . . . in all major job classifications where they are\nunderrepresented'\"); Weber, 433 U.S. at 193 (reserving for Black\nemployees 50% of the openings in craft-training programs until\nthe percentage of Black craftworkers reflected the percentage of\nBlacks in the available labor force). By contrast, the Board's\npolicy, devoid of goals and standards, is governed entirely by\nthe Board's whim, leaving the Board free, if it so chooses, to\ngrant racial preferences that do not promote even the policy's\nclaimed purpose. Indeed, under the terms of this policy, the\nBoard, in pursuit of a \"racially diverse\" work force, could use\naffirmative action to discriminate against those whom Title VII\nwas enacted to protect. Such a policy unnecessarily trammels the\ninterests of nonminority employees.\n          Moreover, both Weber and Johnson unequivocally provide\nthat valid affirmative action plans are \"temporary\" measures that\nseek to \"'attain'\", not \"maintain\" a \"permanent racial . . .\nbalance.\" Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639-40. See Weber, 433 U.S. at\n208. The Board's policy, adopted in 1975, is an established\n\ffixture of unlimited duration, to be resurrected from time to\ntime whenever the Board believes that the ratio between Blacks\nand Whites in any Piscataway School is skewed. On this basis\nalone, the policy contravenes Weber's teaching. See Cunico v.\nPueblo School Dist. No. 60, 917 F.2d 431, 440 (10th Cir. 1990)\n(holding that the school district's layoff decision aimed at\nensuring the employment of the district's only Black\nadministrator was \"outright racial balancing\" in violation of\nWeber's second prong).\n          Finally, we are convinced that the harm imposed upon a\nnonminority employee by the loss of his or her job is so\nsubstantial and the cost so severe that the Board's goal of\nracial diversity, even if legitimate under Title VII, may not be\npursued in this particular fashion. This is especially true\nwhere, as here, the nonminority employee is tenured. In Weberand Johnson,\nwhen considering whether nonminorities were unduly\nencumbered by affirmative action, the Court found it significant\nthat they retained their employment. Weber, 433 U.S. at 208\n(observing that the plan did not require the discharge of\nnonminority workers); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638 (observing that\nthe nonminority employee who was not promoted nonetheless kept\nhis job). We, therefore, adopt the plurality's pronouncement in\nWygant that \"[w]hile hiring goals impose a diffuse burden, often\nforeclosing only one of several opportunities, layoffs impose the\nentire burden of achieving racial equality on particular\nindividuals, often resulting in serious disruption of their\nlives. That burden is too intrusive.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 283\n(footnote omitted).\n         Accordingly, we conclude that under the second prong of\nthe Weber test, the Board's affirmative action policy violates\nTitle VII. In addition to containing an impermissible purpose,\nthe policy \"unnecessarily trammel[s] the interests of the\n[nonminority] employees.\" Weber, 430 U.S. at 208.\n\n                               VI.\n         The district court did not analyze Taxman's claims\nbased on the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and we need\nnot do so in detail here. The parties have agreed that the legal\nanalysis required by the state statute is essentially the same as\nthat undertaken in Title VII cases. While the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt has yet to consider a voluntarily adopted affirmative\naction plan in light of the NJLAD, it is undisputed that the\nNJLAD has been interpreted to parallel Title VII. In Peper v.\nPrinceton Univ. Bd. of Trustees, 389 A.2d 465, 478 (N.J. 1978),\nthe Supreme Court of New Jersey wrote that \"where [Title VII]\nstandards are useful and fair, it is in the best interests of\neveryone concerned to have some uniformity in the law.\"\n         Given that statement, we predict that the New Jersey\nSupreme Court would follow the analytical directive of Weber and\nJohnson. Analysis of this case under the NJLAD would, therefore,\nlead to the same result as that which we have reached under Title\nVII. Sharon Taxman is entitled to summary judgment on her claim\nmade under the NJLAD.\n\f                               VII.\n         Having found the Board liable under Title VII, we turn\nour attention to the issue of damages, addressing first the\ndistrict court's order that Taxman be awarded one hundred percent\nbackpay for the entire period of her layoff. The Board argues\nthat where a backpay award is appropriate, the court's goal\nshould be to restore \"`the conditions and relationships that\nwould have been had there been no'\" unlawful discrimination.\nTeamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 371 (1977) (quoting\nFranks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 769 (1976)).\nAccording to the Board, the district court's award of one hundred\npercent backpay was plainly unfair. Had it not invoked the\naffirmative action plan, the Board would have followed its usual\nprocedure, using a coin toss or other random process to break the\nseniority between Williams and Taxman. Taxman, therefore, would\nhave stood no more than a fifty percent chance of keeping her job\nhad there been no unlawful discrimination.\"\n         We disagree. In deciding backpay issues, a district\ncourt has wide latitude to \"locate `a just result'\" and to\nfurther the \"make whole remedy of Title VII in light of the\ncircumstances of a particular case.\" Albemarle Paper Co. v.\nMoody, 422 U.S. 405, 424-25 (1975). While Taxman cannot be\nreturned to the position that she held prior to her layoff -- one\nof virtually precise equality with Williams in terms of the\nfactors relevant to the decision -- she can be returned to a\nposition of financial equality with Williams through a one\nhundred percent backpay award. We are convinced that this award\nmost closely approximates the conditions that would have\nprevailed in the absence of discrimination.\n         We find an additional basis for our holding in the\nanalysis set forth in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228\n(1989). In that case, the Supreme Court held that where an\nemployee proves that discrimination played a role in an\nemployment decision, the employer will not be found \"liable if it\ncan prove that, even if it had not taken [race] into account it\nwould have come to the same decision regarding a particular\nperson.\" Id. at 242. Here, Taxman has clearly established that\nthe Board is liable and that she was not paid during the relevant\nperiod. Under the logic of Hopkins, the Board cannot avoid a one\nhundred percent backpay award unless it can establish, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that Taxman would have received\nsome lesser amount had the Board not taken race into account.\nThis, of course, the Board cannot do.\n         Given the law and the circumstances presented in this\ncase, we are convinced that the district court's analysis with\nrespect to backpay reflects the sound exercise of judicial\ndiscretion and we will affirm the award.\n         The Board further contends that the district court\nerred in calculating prejudgment interest using the IRS adjusted\nprime rate. According to the Board, the district court should\nhave applied the post-judgment rate set forth in 28 U.S.C. §\n1961(a). This argument is meritless.\n         The matter of prejudgment interest is left to the\ndiscretion of the district court. Although a court \"may\" use the\n\fpost-judgment standards of 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a), Sun Ship, Inc. v.\nMatson Navigation Co., 785 F.2d 59, 63 (3d Cir. 1986), it is not\ncompelled to do so. E.E.O.C. v. Wooster Brush Co. Employees\nRelief Ass'n., 727 F.2d 566, 579 (1984). The adjusted prime\nrate, established periodically by the Secretary of the Treasury\nand codified in 26 U.S.C. § 6621, has been used regularly by\ndistrict courts to calculate prejudgment interest. See, e.g.,\nE.E.O.C. v. Erie County, 751 F.2d 79, 82 (1984) (trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in using adjusted prime rate to\ncalculate the amount of prejudgment interest to be paid on\nbackpay award under the Equal Pay Act).\n         We thus hold that the district court's calculation of\npre-judgment interest was consistent with the sound exercise of\njudicial discretion.\n         Finally, in her cross-appeal, Taxman asks that we find\nthat the district court erred in dismissing her claim for\npunitive damages under the NJLAD.\n         At a January 5, 1994 proceeding devoted to the issue of\ndamages, the district court reaffirmed a decision made at a\npretrial conference to \"strike the punitive damages claim\" on the\nground that \"there is no evidence to support [it].\" (App. at\n209). The court made the following comment with respect to\npunitive damages:\n         I didn't say I felt the board -- I may have\n         said that the board acted in good faith, but\n         I think what I did say is that there's no\n         evidence that would support any claim for\n         punitive damages. And I struck the punitive\n         damages claim.\n\n         There's absolutely no evidence that the board\n         acted willfully, wantonly, outrageously or in\n         any other way than trying its best to make\n         the best of a very unhappy situation.\n\n         The New Jersey Supreme Court has established a high\nthreshold requirement which must be met before an award of\npunitive damages can be sustained. Punitive damages are to be\nawarded only \"`when the wrongdoer's conduct is especially\negregious.'\" Rendine v. Pantzer, 141 N.J. 292, 313, 661 A.2d\n1201, 1215 (1995). \"To warrant a punitive award, the defendant's\nconduct must have been wantonly reckless or malicious. There\nmust be an intentional wrongdoing in the sense of an `evil-\nminded' act accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard to the\nrights of another. . . . The key to the right to punitive\ndamages is the wrongfulness of the intentional action.\" Id.\n\"[The New Jersey] case indicates that the requirement [of\nwillfulness or wantonness] may be satisfied a showing that there\nhas been a deliberate act or omission with knowledge of a high\ndegree of probability of harm and reckless indifference or\nconsequences.'\" Id. (citation omitted). \"[The New Jersey courts\nhave] stated that proof of actual malice [is] \"`a condition\nprecedent to a punitive damages award.'\" Id. (citation omitted).\n         Having examined the record evidence in this case\n\fagainst the background of the New Jersey punitive damages\nstandard, we agree with the district court that the evidence\nwould not support a finding that the Board acted willfully,\nwantonly or outrageously in dismissing Taxman. We conclude,\ntherefore, that Taxman's claim for punitive damages was properly\ndismissed.\n\n                              VIII.\n         While we have rejected the argument that the Board's\nnon-remedial application of the affirmative action policy is\nconsistent with the language and intent of Title VII, we do not\nreject in principle the diversity goal articulated by the Board.\nIndeed, we recognize that the differences among us underlie the\nrichness and strength of our Nation. Our disposition of this\nmatter, however, rests squarely on the foundation of Title VII.\nAlthough we applaud the goal of racial diversity, we cannot agree\nthat Title VII permits an employer to advance that goal through\nnon-remedial discriminatory measures.\n         Having found that the district court properly concluded\nthat the affirmative action plan applied by the Board to lay off\nTaxman is invalid under Title VII, and that the district court\ndid not err in calculating Taxman's damages or in dismissing her\nclaim for punitive damages, we will affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n        TAXMAN v. BD. OF EDUC. OF THE TWP. OF PISCATAWAY,\nNos. 94-5090, 94-5112\nSTAPLETON, Circuit Judge, Concurring:\n\n         I agree that the Board's non-remedial affirmative\naction decision is unlawful because non-remedial affirmative\naction employment decisions cannot pass muster under Title VII.\nIt is unnecessary, however, for the court to decide whether the\nBoard's actions unnecessarily trammel Taxman's interests.\nAccordingly, I would express no opinion on that issue. I join\nthe remainder of the court's opinion.\nUnited States of America, Sharon Taxman, Plaintiff-Intervenor\nv. Bd. of Education of the Township of Piscataway,\nSharon Taxman, Appellant v. Bd. of Education of the Township of\nPiscataway, Nos. 94-5090, 94-5112\n\nSLOVITER, Chief Judge, dissenting, with whom Judges Lewis and\nMcKee join.\n         In the law, as in other professions, it is often how\nthe question is framed that determines the answer that is\nreceived. Although the divisive issue of affirmative action\ncontinues on this country's political agenda, I do not see this\nappeal as raising a broad legal referendum on affirmative action\npolicies. Indeed, it is questionable whether this case is about\naffirmative action at all, as that term has come to be generally\nunderstood -- i.e. preference based on race or gender of one\ndeemed \"less qualified\" over one deemed \"more qualified.\" Nor\ndoes this case even require us to examine the parameters of the\naffirmative action policy originally adopted in 1975 by the Board\n\fof Education of the Township of Piscataway (School Board or\nBoard) in response to a state regulation requiring affirmative\naction programs or the Board's concise 1983 one-page Affirmative\nAction policy.\n         Instead, the narrow question posed by this appeal can\nbe restated as whether Title VII requires a New Jersey school or\nschool board, which is faced with deciding which of two equally\nqualified teachers should be laid off, to make its decision\nthrough a coin toss or lottery, a solution that could be expected\nof the state's gaming tables, or whether Title VII permits the\nschool board to factor into the decision its bona fide belief,\nbased on its experience with secondary schools, that students\nderive educational benefit by having a Black faculty member in an\notherwise all-White department. Because I believe that the area\nof discretion left to employers in educational institutions by\nTitle VII encompasses the School Board's action in this case, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n         The posture in which the legal issue in this case is\npresented is so stripped of extraneous factors that it could well\nserve as the question for a law school moot court. I emphasize\nat the outset issues that this case does not present. We need\nnot decide whether it is permissible for a school to lay off a\nmore qualified employee in favor of a less qualified employee on\nthe basis of race, because that did not happen here. Nor need we\nconsider what requirements Title VII may impose on unwilling\nemployers, or how much racial diversity in a high school faculty\nmay be \"enough.\"\n         Significantly, although the School Board is a public\nemployer, this case does not place before us for decision the\nlimits on race-conscious action imposed on public entities by the\nConstitution because we are presented with no constitutional\nclaim. Therefore, we must measure the Board's actions under the\nrestraints imposed by Title VII rather than the more demanding\nones imposed on government action by the Equal Protection Clause.\nIn this respect the case is similar to that presented in Johnson\nv. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616\n(1987), where the Supreme Court noted that even though the\ndefendant was a public employer it would decide the case only\nunder Title VII because no constitutional issue was raised or\naddressed below. See id. at 620 n.2. The Court also made clear\nthat for purposes of Title VII, the same standard applies to\npublic and private employers, stating that \"[t]he fact that a\npublic employer must also satisfy the Constitution does not\nnegate the fact that the statutory prohibition with which that\nemployer must contend was not intended to extend as far as that\nof the Constitution.\" Id. at 628 n.6. This was an express\nrejection of Justice Scalia's contention \"that the obligations of\na public employer under Title VII must be identical to its\nobligations under the Constitution.\" Id. at 627 n. 6; see alsoid. at 649\n(O'Connor, J., concurring). Thus it is important to\nkeep in mind that we must measure the Board's action in this case\nagainst the same standard we would apply to a private school.\n\nI.\n\f         When in May 1989 the School Board was faced with the\ndisagreeable necessity of reducing by one the teaching staff in\nthe Business Department of Piscataway High School, it recognized\nthat reference to the applicable New Jersey law, which provides\nthe roadmap in terms of seniority, would not suffice here because\nthe two teachers had equal seniority. The Board, which has the\nresponsibility of gauging the educational requirements of the\nstudents under its charge, would have to resort to its own\nexperience as there were no other prescribed guidelines. It did\nnot then turn to the affirmative action policy to make the\ndecision based on race. There was no built-in quota, expressed\nor implied, for minority faculty, and Taxman does not so suggest.\nOn the contrary, the Board next considered a variety of\nundoubtedly relevant factors, any one of which might have tipped\nthe scales in favor of laying off one teacher or the other. Had\nTaxman been deemed a better teacher than Williams, that alone\ncould have pointed the arrow in her direction. Or, had Williams\nparticipated in volunteer activity while Taxman spent her spare\ntime in other activities, that alone could have accounted for\nWilliams' retention. The deposition testimony of several board\nmembers who participated in the decision indicates that before\nthe affirmative action policy was considered, a number of other\ncriteria were discussed to break the tie, including work\nperformance, certifications, evaluations, teaching ability, and\nvolunteerism. The two teachers with the least seniority, Taxman\nand Williams, were determined to be equal with respect to each of\nthese other criteria.\n         The Board's Vice President, Paula Van Riper, testified:\n         [T]he seniority and the person's\n         qualifications came into play first. If one\n         was more senior than the other, it would have\n         ended right there, if they were of like\n         seniority. From that point it was based on\n         their work performance and their evaluations\n         . . . . There was some consideration given\n         . . . to the various other activities that\n         they did . . . . But certainly the weight\n         would be given to their performance in the\n         classroom. At that point we were told that\n         these are two teachers of equal ability,\n         equal qualifications, I should say. They\n         . . . both[] had good evaluations, they were\n         good teachers, they were supportive of the\n         school district, volunteered in various ways\n         and they . . . had similar certification or\n         like certification and their seniority was\n         the same so therefore they were equal.\n\n\nDa179-80.\n         The equal position of both teachers in light of all\nrelevant criteria was also stressed by the Director of Personnel,\nGordon Moore, who explained: \"we . . . concluded that work\nhistory or performance criteria [were] not going to be usable in\n\fbreaking the tie, because there was no distinction that could be\nmade.\" Da177.\n         In its opinion, the majority declares the School\nBoard's affirmative action policy unlawful. An examination of\nthe so-called affirmative action policy reveals that it does\nnothing more than place before the School Board the need to\nconsider minority personnel among other equally qualifiedcandidates for\nemployment decisions. Da5, 53. That this was a\nnecessary reminder in 1975 when the policy was formed can hardly\nbe gainsaid. I believe that it also was a useful reminder in\n1989, when this School Board was faced with this decision, and\nperhaps even today.\n         A review of the record makes clear that the Board did\nnot view itself as bound to select Williams for retention by the\n1975 affirmative action policy, which speaks only of\nrecommendations, but after discussion and consideration the Board\nmade a discretionary decision to select Williams for retention to\nfurther the educational goal of a diverse faculty. Da72, 94.\n         The Board members described their purpose in using the\ngoal of diversity underlying the previously adopted affirmative\naction policy as a factor in the layoff decision as reflecting\nthe \"general feeling . . . that it was valuable for the students\nto see in the various employment roles a wide range of\nbackground[s],\" Da74, and \"the desire to have a diverse teaching\nstaff in the school district.\" Da175-76. It was also intended\nto send \"a very clear message that we feel that our staff should\nbe culturally diverse [for the benefit of the students]\" and to\n\"encourage awareness and acceptance and tolerance [of people of\nall backgrounds].\" Da75. Thus, the Board took into\nconsideration that if Williams were laid off, the Business\nDepartment faculty at the school would be all White. Da94, 110,\n168, 175-176.\n                               II.\n         It was the Board's decision to include the desire for a\nracially diverse faculty among the various factors entering into\nits discretionary decision that the majority of this court brands\na Title VII violation as a matter of law. No Supreme Court case\ncompels that anomalous result. Notwithstanding the majority's\nliteral construction of the language of Title VII, no Supreme\nCourt case has ever interpreted the statute to preclude\nconsideration of race or sex for the purpose of insuring\ndiversity in the classroom as one of many factors in an\nemployment decision, the situation presented here. Moreover, in\nthe only two instances in which the Supreme Court examined under\nTitle VII, without the added scrutiny imposed by the Equal\nProtection Clause, affirmative action plans voluntarily adopted\nby employers that gave preference to race or sex as a\ndeterminative factor, the Court upheld both plans.\n         In its 1979 decision in United Steelworkers v. Weber,\n443 U.S. 193 (1979), the Court held that an agreement between a\nprivate company and a union that sought to remedy the historical\nexclusion of Blacks from skilled craft unions by reserving half\nthe openings in an in-house training program for Blacks did not\nviolate Title VII. A scarce decade later, it reached a similar\n\fdecision in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County,\n480 U.S. 616 (1987), where the plan that the Court upheld\nauthorized consideration of the gender of a qualified applicant\nas one of various factors for promoting employees into jobs in\nwhich women had been significantly underrepresented.\n         The majority presents Weber and Johnson as if their\nsignificance lies in the obstacle course they purportedly\nestablish for any employer adopting an affirmative action\nprogram.   But, as the Justices of the Supreme Court recognized,\nthe significance of each of those cases is that the Supreme Court\nsustained the affirmative action plans presented, and in doing so\ndeviated from the literal interpretation of Title VII precluding\nuse of race or gender in any employment action. As Justice\nBrennan explained in Weber, \"It is a 'familiar rule that a thing\nmay be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the\nstatute, because not within its spirit nor within the intention\nof its makers.'\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 201 (quoting Holy Trinity\nChurch v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 459 (1892)). The Justices\ndissenting in those cases noted and vigorously objected to the\ndeparture. See, e.g., Weber, 443 U.S. at 222, 228 (Rehnquist,\nJ., dissenting) (asserting that the majority \"eludes the clear\nstatutory language\" and that Kaiser's affirmative action plan is\n\"flatly prohibited by the plain language of Title VII\"); Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 670 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"It is well to keep in\nmind just how thoroughly Weber rewrote the statute it purported\nto construe . . . Weber disregarded the text of the statute,\ninvoking instead its 'spirit'\").\n         While the majority in this case views the Supreme\nCourt's articulation of the factors that rationalized its\nupholding of the affirmative action plans in those cases as\nestablishing boundaries, no language in either Weber or Johnsonso states\nand, in fact, there is language to the contrary. The\nmajority draws the line at the factors used in those cases. In\nboth Weber and Johnson, the Court inquired whether consideration\nof race in the employment decision was justified by a permissible\npurpose, and then examined the effect on nonminorities to\nascertain whether the action taken \"unnecessarily trammel[ed] the\ninterests of the white employees.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 208;\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 630.\n         However, it does not follow as a matter of logic that\nbecause the two affirmative action plans in Weber and Johnsonwhich sought\nto remedy imbalances caused by past discrimination\nwithstood Title VII scrutiny, every affirmative action plan that\npursues some purpose other than correcting a manifest imbalance\nor remedying past discrimination will run afoul of Title VII.\nIndeed, the Court in Weber explicitly cautioned that its holding\nin that case should not be read to define the outer boundaries of\nthe area of discretion left to employers by Title VII for the\nvoluntary adoption of affirmative action measures. The Court\nstated:\n         We need not today define in detail the line\n         of demarcation between permissible and\n         impermissible affirmative action plans. It\n         suffices to hold that the challenged Kaiser-\n\f         USWA affirmative action plan falls on the\n         permissible side of the line. The purposes\n         of the plan mirror those of the statute.\n         Both were designed to break down old patterns\n         of racial segregation and hierarchy. Both\n         were structured to \"open employment\n         opportunities for Negroes in occupations\n         which have been traditionally closed to\n         them.\"\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 208. See also id. at 215-16 (Blackmun, J.,\nconcurring)(noting that Kaiser plan \"is a moderate one\" and that\n\"the Court's opinion does not foreclose other forms of\naffirmative action\").\n         The majority opinion in Johnson made no attempt to draw\nthe line that Weber left undefined. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 642\n(Stevens, J., concurring) (\"I write . . . to . . . emphasize that\nthe opinion does not establish the permissible outer limits of\nvoluntary [affirmative action] programs\"). Although Justice\nO'Connor's concurring opinion argued that permissible purposes\nunder Title VII were limited to those that served to remedy past\ndiscrimination, Johnson 480 U.S. at 649, her vote was the sixth\nin favor of the majority's holding and therefore not crucial to\nthe outcome of the case. It follows that her narrow reading\nshould not be read as constituting the view of the Court. SeeMarks v.\nUnited States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977).\n\n         The majority here has taken the language of Weber where\nthe Court observed that the plan's purposes \"mirrored\" those of\nthe statute, and has elevated it to a litmus test under which an\naffirmative action plan can only pass muster under Title VII if\nparticular language in the text or legislative history of the\nstatute can be identified that matches the articulated purpose of\nthe plan. Nothing in Weber suggests that the Court intended by\nits \"mirroring\" language to create such a rigid test.\n         In Weber, when the Court found that the purposes of the\nplan were consistent with those of Title VII, it did so by\nreference not only to the language of the legislative history,\nbut to the historical context from which the Act arose as well.\nId. at 201. In Johnson, the Court made no attempt at all to\nidentify language in the legislative history paralleling the\nparticular objectives of the plan it sustained. Thus, even in\nthose cases the Court did not demonstrate the kind of close fit\nbetween the plan and the statutory history demanded of the Board\nin this case.\n         In Weber, the Court's examination into the purposes of\nTitle VII led it to the conclusion that the Act was designed to\npromote \"the integration of blacks into the mainstream of\nAmerican society,\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 202, and the breakdown of\n\"old patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy,\" id. at 208.\nThe Kaiser affirmative action plan was consistent with these\nsweeping, broadly stated purposes and hence was sustained.\n         Of course, I do not disagree with the majority that\n\"Title VII was written to eradicate not only discrimination per\nse but the consequences of prior discrimination,\" but I do not\n\fbelieve that in doing so, Congress intended to limit the reach of\nTitle VII to remedying past discrimination, thereby turning a\nblind eye toward those social forces that give rise to future\ndiscrimination. Title VII, which was a part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, was fundamentally forward-looking legislation, and\nthat purpose should not be ignored.\n         The effort to remedy the consequences of past\ndiscrimination (such as the \"patterns of segregation and\nhierarchy\" referred to in Weber, 443 U.S. at 208), cannot be\nisolated from the statute's broader aim to eliminate those\npatterns that were potential causes of continuing or future\ndiscrimination. The causal relationship is illustrated by the\nindustry at issue in Weber, where the Court noted that the\nongoing imbalance in the hiring of craftworkers had its roots in\na history of discrimination that had excluded Blacks from craft\nunions and thus prevented them from acquiring the necessary\nqualifications. Id. at 198. In describing the overarching goal\ntoward which the Civil Rights Act was aimed, the House Report\nspoke of the need to \"eliminat[e] all of the causes and\nconsequences of racial and other types of discrimination against\nminorities.\" H.R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at\n18 (1963), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2391, 2393 (emphasis\nadded).\n         Thus, using the approach taken in Weber and Johnson as\na springboard, actions consistent with and in furtherance of the\nbroad statutory goal of eliminating the causes of discrimination\nare not per se proscribed by Title VII. This generation of young\npeople may not recall that in 1964 racial homogeneity in schools\nwas viewed as among the most fundamental and pernicious aspects\nof the social pattern undergirding the system of discrimination\nthat the Civil Rights Act sought to dismantle. In the years\nleading up to the Act's passage, school integration was one of\nthe focal points of the civil rights movement. The Senate Report\naccompanying the 1972 amendments to Title VII, when it was\nexpanded to cover state and local governments, noted the\nconnection between racial homogeneity in schools and attitudes\nthat lead to discrimination:\n              It is difficult to imagine a more\n              sensitive area than educational\n              institutions where the youth of the\n              Nation are exposed to a multitude of\n              ideas and impressions that will strongly\n              influence their future development. To\n              permit discrimination here [among\n              faculty and staff] would, more than in\n              any other area, tend to promote existing\n              misconceptions and stereotypical\n              categorizations which in turn would lead\n              to future patterns of discrimination.\nS. Rep. No. 415, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1971)).\n         In other contexts, the Court has repeatedly recognized\nracial diversity in the classroom as an important means of\ncombatting the attitudes that can lead to future patterns of\ndiscrimination. As Justice Stevens observed in Wygant:\n\f         In the context of public education, it is\n         quite obvious that a school board may\n         reasonably conclude that an integrated\n         faculty will be able to provide benefits to\n         the student body that could not be provided\n         by an all-white, or nearly all-white,\n         faculty. For one of the most important\n         lessons that the American public schools\n         teach is that the diverse ethnic, cultural\n         and national backgrounds that have been\n         brought together in our famous \"melting pot\"\n         do not identify essential differences among\n         the human beings that inhabit our land. It\n         is one thing for a white child to be taught\n         by a white teacher that color, like beauty,\n         is only \"skin deep\"; it is far more\n         convincing to experience that truth on a day-\n         to-day basis during the routine ongoing\n         learning process.\n476 U.S. at 315 (Stevens, J., dissenting). See also Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 647 (Stevens, J., concurring) (noting educational benefit\nto be derived from racial diversity, \"'by dispelling for black\nand white students alike any idea that white supremacy governs\nour social institutions'\" (quoting Sullivan, The Supreme Court--\nComment, Sins of Discrimination: Last Term's Affirmative Action\nCases, 100 Harv.L.Rev. 78, 96 (1986))); Washington v. Seattle\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 473 (1982) (\"Attending an\nethnically diverse school may help . . . prepar[e] minority\nchildren 'for citizenship in our pluralistic society,' while, we\nmay hope, teaching members of the racial majority 'to live in\nharmony and mutual respect' with children of minority\nheritage.\"(citations omitted)); Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick,\n443 U.S. 449, 461, 467 (1979) (disapproving policies that\n\"deprive black students of opportunities for contact with and\nlearning from white teachers, and . . . deprive white students of\nsimilar opportunities to meet, know and learn from black\nteachers\"); Kromnick v. School District of Philadelphia, 739 F.2d\n894, 905 (3d Cir. 1984)(\"Schools are great instruments in\nteaching social policy [from which students learn] from the\nimages and experiences that surround them . . . a spirit of\ntolerance and mutual benefit.\"), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1107\n(1985).\n         It is \"ironic indeed\" that the promotion of racial\ndiversity in the classroom, which has formed so central a role in\nthis country's struggle to eliminate the causes and consequences\nof racial discrimination, is today held to be at odds with the\nvery Act that was triggered by our \"Nation's concern over\ncenturies of racial injustice.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 204. Nor\ndoes it seem plausible that the drafters of Title VII intended it\nto be interpreted so as to require a local school district to\nresort to a lottery to determine which of two qualified teachers\nto retain, rather than employ the School Board's own educational\npolicy undertaken to insure students an opportunity to learn from\na teacher who was a member of the very group whose treatment\n\fmotivated Congress to enact Title VII in the first place. In my\nview, the Board's purpose of obtaining the educational benefit to\nbe derived from a racially diverse faculty is entirely consistent\nwith the purposes animating Title VII and the Civil Rights Act of\n1964.\n         The majority criticizes the Board's use of caselaw\nconstruing the Equal Protection Clause in this Title VII case,\nnotwithstanding the Supreme Court's explicit statement in Johnsonthat\nTitle VII's constraint on affirmative action was \"not\nintended to extend as far as that of the Constitution.\" 480 U.S.\nat 628 n.6. Nothing in the Court's language in the Johnsonfootnote\nsuggests that we confine it to the particular factual\ncontext in which it was made, and the Court is certainly\nsufficiently articulate to limit its language when so inclined.\nNor is the Johnson footnote the only place where the Court\nsignified its understanding that Title VII imposes fewer\nlimitations on employers' voluntary affirmative action than does\nthe Constitution. In Weber, the Court spoke of the \"narrowness\nof [its] inquiry\" since the plan did not involve state action and\nhence did not present an alleged violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause, Weber, 443 U.S. at 200, and later stated that\n\"Title VII . . . was not intended to incorporate and\nparticularize the commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.\" Id. at 206 n.6 (quoted in Johnson, 480 U.S. at 627\nn.6). The latter statement was not made in a discussion that had\nto do with the \"factual predicate\" for demonstrating the need for\nremedial affirmative action, as the majority would confine the\nsimilar language in Johnson.\n         In any event, ultimately it is the Supreme Court rather\nthan this one that will decide whether Title VII allows an\nemployer more discretion to implement race-conscious employment\npolicies than does the Constitution in the employer's effort to\npromote the underlying goals of the Act. But, in the absence of\nany dispositive precedent, I believe it would be shortsighted for\nus to disregard the Supreme Court's statements regarding the\nadvantages of diversity in an educational context when examining\nthe limited use to which diversity was used as a factor in the\nBoard's decision here. In Regents of the University of\nCalifornia v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), where the Court\nconsidered a University of California affirmative action program\nfor student admissions, Justice Powell, who announced the\njudgment of the Court, recognized that a diverse student body\nleads to a \"robust exchange of ideas,\" id. at 312 (quoting\nKeyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967)), and\nnoted that the \"essential\" elements of academic freedom include\nthe ability not only to select the student body but to determine\n\"who may teach,\" id. (quoting Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S.\n234, 263 (1957)).\n         In Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267\n(1986), the Court held that preferential protection against\nlayoffs afforded to minority teachers by the public school\nboard's affirmative action plan could not be sustained, because\nthe school board's proffered justification for the plan -- that\nminority teachers were needed to provide role models for minority\n\fstudents -- was not sufficiently compelling to withstand the\nstrict scrutiny to which it was subject under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Id. at 274-276 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C.J.,\nRehnquist, J. and O'Connor, J.); id. at 288 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring); id. at 295 (White, J., concurring). However,\nJustice O'Connor, in her concurring opinion which was the\ndecisive vote in the Court's holding, specifically distinguished\nthe goal of providing role models from \"the very different goal\nof promoting racial diversity among the faculty,\" explicitly\nleaving open the possibility that the latter goal might be\nsufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster. Id. at\n288 n.*. She also made a favorable reference to Justice Powell's\nendorsement of diversity in the classroom in Bakke, stating,\n\"although its precise contours are uncertain, a state interest in\nthe promotion of racial diversity has been found sufficiently\n'compelling,' at least in the context of higher education, to\nsupport the use of racial considerations in furthering that\ninterest.\" Id. at 286. Her position, plus that of the four\ndissenting justices, (Marshall, J., dissenting, joined by Brennan\n& Blackmun, JJ.) (seeking \"to achieve diversity and stability for\nthe benefit of all students\" through faculty integration is a\nconstitutionally sufficient purpose); id. at 315 (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting) (\"'recognition of the desirability of multi-ethnic\nrepresentation on the teaching faculty'\" is a \"completely sound\neducational purpose\" (citation omitted)), meant there were five\njustices in Wygant who approved in general terms the concept that\nthe educational benefit derived from diversity in the classroom\ncan constitute an acceptable justification for affirmative\naction. See also Britton v. South Bend Community School Corp.,\n819 F.2d 766, 773 n.1 (7th Cir.) (en banc) (Flaum & Bauer, JJ.,\nconcurring) (\"Remedying past discrimination is not necessarily\nthe only government purpose sufficiently compelling to justify\nthe remedial use of race. Providing faculty diversity may be a\nsecond.\"), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 925 (1987); Zaslawsky v. Board\nof Education of Los Angeles, 610 F.2d 661, 664 (9th Cir. 1979)(in\nequal protection context, purpose of \"enhanc[ing] the educational\nopportunities available to the students by achieving better\nracial balance in the teaching faculty . . . has been well\nrecognized and approved by the Supreme Court\").\n         I therefore respectfully disagree with the majority,\nboth in its construction of Weber and Johnson as leaving no doors\nopen for any action that takes race into consideration in an\nemployment situation other than to remedy past discrimination and\nthe consequential racial imbalance in the workforce, and in what\nappears to be its limited view of the purposes of Title VII. I\nwould hold that a school board's bona fide decision to obtain the\neducational benefit to be derived from a racially diverse faculty\nis a permissible basis for its voluntary affirmative action under\nTitle VII scrutiny.\n                               III.\n         It is undeniable that, in the abstract, a layoff\nimposes a far greater burden on the affected employee than a\ndenial of promotion or even a failure to hire. In this case,\nhowever, it cannot be said with any certainty that Taxman would\n\fhave avoided the layoff had the Board's decision not been race-\nconscious. If a random selection had been made, Taxman would\nhave had no more than a fifty-percent chance of not being laid\noff. Thus, this was not a situation where Taxman had a\n\"legitimate and firmly rooted expectation\" of no layoff.\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 638; cf. Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d\n1273, 1278 (1st Cir. 1992) (where, even in absence of affirmative\naction scheme, White applicants \"could not reasonably have felt\nassured that they would be appointed,\" plan did not disturb any\nlegitimate expectations), cert. denied, 113 S.Ct. 1043 (1993).\n         This differs from the situation of an employee who is\nnext in line for a promotion by the objective factor of\nseniority. Taxman's qualifications were merely equal to those of\nher competitor for this purpose. In Johnson the Court held that\nbecause there were six other employees who also met the\nqualifications for the job, Johnson had no \"entitlement\" or\n\"legitimate firmly rooted expectation\" in the promotion, even\nthough he had scored higher than the others on the qualifying\ntest. See Peightal v. Metropolitan Dade County, 940 F.2d 1394,\n1408 (11th Cir. 1991) (affirmative action plan valid under Title\nVII where it never requires hiring unqualified person over\nqualified person), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1073 (1992); cf. United\nStates v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 177-78 (same under equal\nprotection). Moreover, just as the plaintiff in Johnson remained\neligible for promotion in the future, 480 U.S. at 638, Taxman\nretained recall rights after her layoff, and did in fact regain\nher job.\n         The majority relies in part on Wygant, where the\nSupreme Court found that the use of faculty layoffs to meet\naffirmative action goals in a public school system imposed too\nheavy a burden on White employees. Wygant, 476 U.S. at 282-83.\nHowever, the Court's holding that the Wygant plan was not\n\"narrowly tailored\" for purposes of an equal protection challenge\nis not dispositive of the present inquiry as to whether a plan\n\"unnecessarily trammels\" the rights of White employees for Title\nVII purposes. Not only was a different legal standard applicable\nbut Wygant is also distinguishable because the Wygant plan caused\nnonminority teachers with more seniority to be laid off in order\nto retain minority teachers with less seniority. Wygant, 476\nU.S. at 282. The Wygant plan actually caused teachers to be laid\noff who, in the absence of the plan, would have had no risk of\nlayoff. That burden -- increasing the chance of layoff from zero\nto one hundred percent -- is significantly heavier than that\nimposed on Taxman, who would have had a substantial chance of\nbeing laid off even absent any consideration of diversity.\n         Only three members of the Court subscribed to language\nin the plurality opinion in Wygant suggesting that the use of\nlayoffs to accomplish affirmative action goals will never survive\nstrict scrutiny. See 476 U.S. at 284. The two concurring\njustices did not go that far. See id. at 293 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (\"[n]or is it necessary, in my view, to resolve the\ntroubling question[] whether any layoff provision could survive\nstrict scrutiny\"); id. at 295 (White, J., concurring) (confining\nhis conclusion to the specifics of the layoff policy at issue).\n\fTherefore I do not read Wygant to hold that no race-conscious\nlayoff decision will survive Title VII scrutiny.\n         The majority gives a similarly narrow reading to Weberand\nJohnson, construing these cases to impose a wooden,\n\"unequivocal\" requirement that all affirmative action plans must\nbe explicitly temporary in order to be valid. Majority\nTypescript at 40. In fact, the Johnson plan itself \"contain[ed]\nno explicit end date,\" Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639, and the Court\nindicated that only certain plans that are particularly\nburdensome on nonminorities in other respects need necessarily be\nexpressly temporary. \"Express assurance that a program is only\ntemporary may be necessary if the program actually sets aside\npositions according to specific numbers.\" Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n639-40 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court's references to the\ntemporary duration of the plans at issue in Weber and Johnson are\nmore accurately construed as an understandable effort to assure\nthat race does not become a permanently embedded consideration in\nemployment decisions. The significant consideration is whether\nthere has been an effort \"to minimize the effect of the program\non other employees,\" not whether the underlying policy is set to\nrun a specified number of years. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 640.\n          In the situation before us, I see ample basis from\nwhich to deduce an effort to minimize the effect of the Board's\naffirmative action policy on non-minority employees. One such\naspect is the discretionary nature of the policy. The Board is\nfree not to apply the policy, even to break a tie. Also\nsignificant is the infrequency with which the Board has resorted\nto the policy. Although it may be of little comfort to Taxman,\nthe fact that this is the first time in the twenty years since\nthe policy was adopted that it has been applied to a layoff\ndecision demonstrates the minimum impact on White teachers as a\nwhole. And since, by its own terms, it only applies in the rare\ninstances in which two candidates are of different races but\nequal qualifications and the department in question is not\nalready diverse, it is likely that it will continue to be\ninfrequently applied. See District Court's Final Judgment and\nContingent Order, entered February 15, 1994 at 2 (denying request\nfor broad injunction because \"[t]here is, in the court's view, no\nlikelihood that the conduct at issue in this case will recur\").\n         In this connection, I deem it further evidence of the\nBoard's interest in minimizing any adverse effect on non-\nminorities that it has not defined diversity by any specific\nnumerical goal. Although the majority regards that as a major\nconcern, I view the lack of any such figure as an indication that\nthe Board's plan does not impose a fixed quota with the rigidity\nattendant thereto.\n         It is not the province of this court to intrude into\nwhat is essentially an educational decision. Once we have\ndetermined that promoting faculty diversity for educational\npurposes can be a valid justification for an appropriately\nlimited race-conscious action, it is not our role to second-guess\nthe judgment of educators as to the level of diversity that\nproduces the educational environment they deem appropriate.\nThe Board's action is an attempt to create an educational\n\fenvironment that will maximize the ability of students to address\nracial stereotypes and misconceptions born of lack of\nfamiliarity. I find it difficult to believe that an Act that was\ngiven birth by the tensions of the civil rights era precludes it\nfrom doing so under the facts before us here. Given the record\nbefore us, the consequence of the narrow reading that the\nmajority gives Weber and Johnson is the very irony that the\nSupreme Court said would result from interpreting this civil\nrights statute in a manner divorced from its historic context.\nAs the Court noted in Weber:\n         [i]t would be ironic indeed if a law triggered by a\n         Nation's concern over centuries of racial injustice and\n         intended to improve the lot of those who had \"been\n         excluded from the American dream for so long,\" 110\n         Cong. Rec. 6552 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey),\n         constituted the first legislative prohibition of all\n         voluntary, private, race-conscious efforts to abolish\n         traditional patterns of racial segregation and\n         hierarchy.\n\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 204.\n         I return to the question raised at the outset: whether\nTitle VII requires that the Board toss a coin to make the layoff\nselection between equally situated employees. In his opinion for\nthe majority in Weber, Justice Brennan noted the distinction made\nby Congress between requiring and permitting affirmative action\nby employers. See Weber, 443 U.S. at 205-06. He deemed it\nimportant that, while Congress explicitly provided that Title VII\nshould not be interpreted to require any employer to grant\npreferential treatment to a group because of its race, Congress\nnever stated that Title VII should not be interpreted to permitcertain\nvoluntary efforts.\n         In this case, the majority gives too little\nconsideration to the tie-breaking method that its holding will\nimpose on the Board. It points to no language in Title VII to\nsuggest that a lottery is required as the solution to a layoff\ndecision in preference to a reasoned decision by members of the\nSchool Board, some of whom are experienced educators, that race\nof a faculty member has a relevant educational significance if\nthe department would otherwise be all White. While it may seem\nfairer to some, I see nothing in Title VII that requires use of a\nlottery.\n         Because I cannot say that faculty diversity is not a\npermissible purpose to support the race conscious decision made\nhere and because the Board's action was not overly intrusive on\nTaxman's rights, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment\nfor Taxman under Title VII and direct that summary judgment be\ngranted to the School Board.\nTaxman v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of Piscataway, 94-5090/5112\n\n\nSCIRICA, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom Chief Judge\nSloviter joins.\n\f         While I find much with which I agree in the majority's\nopinion, I am constrained to express my disagreement because I\nbelieve education presents unique concerns.\n         In University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S.\n265 (1978), Justice Powell recognized that \"the 'nation's future\ndepends upon leaders trained through wide exposure' to the ideas\nand mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.\"\nId. at 313 (citation omitted). As he noted, in the university:\n\"[A] great deal of learning occurs . . . through interactions\namong students of both sexes, of different races, religions, and\nbackgrounds . . . .\" Id. at 312-13 n.48 (citation omitted).\nEighteen years later, the wisdom of this statement resonates as\nstrongly as ever. When added to a university's high academic\nstandards, this exposure constitutes a formidable educational\nexperience.\n         In this case, the Piscataway Board of Education\nconcluded that a diverse faculty also serves a compelling\neducational purpose; namely, it benefits students in the business\ndepartment by exposing them to teachers with varied backgrounds.\nThe Board implemented a program that, in limited circumstances,\nallows consideration of race as a factor in school employment\ndecisions. The Board did not countenance the layoff of a more-\nqualified teacher in the place of a less-qualified one. It did\nnot prefer teachers junior in seniority to those with more\nexperience. Rather it concluded that when teachers are equal in\nability and in all other respects--and only then--diversity of\nthe faculty is a relevant consideration.\n         I do not believe Title VII prevents a school district,\nin the exercise of its professional judgment, from preferring one\nequally qualified teacher over another for a valid educational\npurpose.\n         Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nUnited States v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of Piscataway\nSharon Taxman v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of Piscataway\nNos. 94-5090 and 94-5112\n\n\nLEWIS, Circuit Judge, with whom Judge McKee joins, dissenting.\n         I join in Chief Judge Sloviter's dissent, as well as\nthose of each of my dissenting colleagues.\n         I would only add that we should be mindful of the\neffects the majority's approach will impose upon legitimate,\nthoughtful efforts to redress the vestiges of our Nation's\nhistory of discrimination in the workplace and in education;\nefforts which, in seeking to achieve pluralism and diversity,\nhave helped define and enrich our offices and institutions, and\nwhich were intended to open, and keep open, the doors of\nopportunity to those who have \"been excluded from the American\ndream for so long.\" See 110 Cong. Rec. 6552 (1964) (excerpted\nfrom Sen. Humphrey's remarks). This, after all, is what I had\nalways thought Title VII was intended to accomplish. More\nimportantly, as Chief Judge Sloviter notes, these goals are\n\fplainly supported by the statute's legislative history. Thus,\nwhile the majority holds that Title VII only allows race to be\nconsidered in remedying a history of intentional discrimination\nor a \"manifest imbalance,\" I believe this conclusion is\nfundamentally at odds with the overriding goals of the statute.\nAnd the real-life impact of the majority's unprecedented\nconstruction of Title VII is readily apparent when one\ncontemplates the myriad of difficult decisions that employers\nacross the nation face everyday.\n         Somewhere out there in the real world, for example,\nthere is a law firm with a racial make-up (a workforce) akin to\nPiscataway High School's; a firm which lacks a history of\nintentional discrimination in hiring but, due to economic\nconcerns, must decide between retaining one of two attorneys --\nthe first and only black associate to work in its prestigious\nanti-trust department, or his equally qualified white\ncounterpart. The firm's management committee may decide that to\nlay-off the black associate would be an unwise and potentially\ndamaging business decision because it would negate the large\ninvestment of time, effort and money spent trying to recruit and\nretain minority lawyers. In other words, the firm may believe\nthat diversity would be good for business and good for itself,\nso, everything else being equal, it decides to lay-off the white\nassociate.\n         In a situation such as this, the firm's reliance upon\nrace as one among many factors in making its decision is the type\nof management prerogative which is totally consistent with the\ngoals and underlying purpose behind Title VII. See Weber, 443\nU.S. at 206 (noting that Title VII's legislative history\ndemonstrates that the statute was not intended to place\nunnecessary limits upon \"management prerogatives\"). After it\nreads the majority's decision, however, it seems clear that the\nfirm will be forced to disregard its own better business\njudgment, forsake its recent recruiting successes among\nminorities and, I suppose, flip a coin on its own future as well\nas the young associates', all in order to avoid the specter of\nTitle VII liability and an enormous damage award.\n         At times, a private college, with a handful of\nminorities on its faculty and with no history of intentional\ndiscrimination in hiring, is faced with the unenviable task of\ndeciding which of two young associate professors with\nindistinguishable records to grant tenure in a particular\ndepartment. The only difference between the two is that one is\nwhite and the other is Latino. After reviewing all of the other\nfactors and finding them in equipoise, the tenure committee may\ndecide to offer the position to the Latino associate professor\nbecause there has never been a tenured Latino professor in any\ndepartment at the college, and because it believes his presence\nat the college will be a significant benefit to the entire\nstudent body. As with the law firm, this decision is entirely\nconsistent with Title VII because it is motivated by some of the\nsame concerns that lead Congress to enact the statute. SeeWeber, 443 U.S.\nat 208 (noting that the plan was valid under\nTitle VII in part because the \"purposes . . . mirror those of the\n\fstatute\").\n         But again, the majority's rationale will thwart the\ncollege's ability to rely upon its independent judgment in\ndeciding what is in the best interests of the students whom it is\ncharged with educating. Instead, according to the majority, that\nimportant judgment is better exercised (in this case may only be\nexercised) by resorting to a coin-flip.\n         One could cite countless other examples of the\nsignificant and ultimately counterproductive effects of the\nmajority's narrow construction of Title VII, but suffice it to\nsay that in my view, Title VII was not enacted to prevent the\nthoughtful, deliberative processes employed by such a law firm or\ncollege. I believe that in this case the school board's decision\nto consider race, among other factors, in an attempt to ensure a\ndiverse faculty for its students was in furtherance of Title\nVII's goal of breaking-down \"existing misconceptions and\nstereotypical categorizations which in turn lead to future\npatterns of discrimination.\" See S. Rep. No. 415, 92nd Cong.,\n1st Sess. 12 (1971). Accordingly, its decision was as legal as\nit was laudable.\n         I believe the majority's decision eviscerates the\npurpose and the goals of Title VII. I respectfully\ndissent.Taxman v. Board of Education of the Twp. of Piscataway\nNos. 94-5090 & 94-5112\n\nMcKEE, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom SLOVITER, Chief Judgeand\nLEWIS, Circuit Judge join.\n         I join each the opinions of my dissenting colleagues,\nbut write only to elaborate upon what I consider to be important\nconsiderations in our analysis. \"The prohibition against racial\ndiscrimination in §§ 703(a) and (d) of Title VII must [ ] be read\nagainst the background of the legislative history of Title VII\nand the historical context from which the Act arose.\" United\nSteelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193, 201 (1979).\n         We have now come full circle. A law enacted by Congress\nin 1964 to move this country closer to an integrated society and\naway from the legacy of \"separate but equal\" is being interpreted\nas outlawing this Board of Education's good faith effort to teach\nstudents the value of diversity. The selection of Ms. Williams\nmeant that the business department would retain the only Black\nteacher tenured in that department in anyone's memory. Board\nPresident Theodore H. Kruse testified that it was his \"general\nfeeling . . . that it was valuable for the students to see in the\nvarious employment roles a wide range of background[s]\" and that\ndiversity \"was also valuable to the work force and in particular\nto the teaching staff.\" Da74. Kruse further explained that \"by\nretaining Mrs. Williams it was sending a very clear message that\nwe feel that our student population is culturally diverse and\nthere is a distinct advantage to students . . . to be made . . .\nmore aware, more tolerant, more accepting, more understanding of\npeople of all background[s].\" Da75. I can not believe that\nTitle VII was intended to strike down such an action.\n         As Chief Judge Sloviter points out, the majority's\nruling is based upon an interpretation of United Steelworkers v.\n\fWeber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), and Johnson v. Transportation Agency,\n480 U.S. 616 (1987) that conflicts with the language used in\nthose cases. See Typescript at 10-11 (Sloviter, C.J.,\ndissenting). The majority's conclusion that affirmative action\nplans not limited to attempts to remedy past discrimination run\nafoul of Title VII simply ignores the legislative history that\nWeber and Johnson require us to consider.\n                    Given the interpretation of [Title VII] the\n                    Court adopted in Weber, I see no reason why\n                    the employer has any duty, prior to granting\n                    a preference to a qualified minority\n                    employee, to determine whether his past\n                    conduct might constitute an arguable\n                    violation of Title VII. Indeed, in some\n                    instances the employer might find it more\n                    helpful to focus on the future. Instead of\n                    retroactively scrutinizing his own or\n                    society's possible exclusions of minorities\n                    in the past to determine the outer limits of\n                    a valid affirmative-action program -- or\n                    indeed, any particular affirmative-action\n                    decision -- in many cases the employer will\n                    find it more appropriate to consider other\n                    legitimate reasons to give preferences to\n                    members of under-represented groups.\n                    Statutes enacted for the benefit of minority\n                    groups should not block these forward-looking\n                    considerations.\n          480 U.S. at 646-47 (Stevens, J., concurring). This is\nparticularly true in the field of education where young people\nare developing opinions and beliefs that will determine their\nattitudes as citizens, and this country's future. Under such\ncircumstances, the School Board considered Ms. Williams' race as\na factor that was weighed in the balance with all other factors\nin making a very difficult choice between two equally fine\nteachers.\n         Similar consideration of an employee's sex has been\nupheld in Johnson. There, the Court stated:\n                    We therefore hold that the Agency\n                    appropriately took into account as one factor\n                    the sex of [the employee] in determining that\n                    she should be promoted to the road dispatcher\n                    position. The decision to do so was made\n                    pursuant to an affirmative action plan that\n                    represents a moderate, flexible, case-by-case\n                    approach to effecting a gradual improvement\n                    in the representation of minorities and women\n                    in the Agency's work force. Such a plan is\n                    fully consistent with Title VII, for it\n                    embodies the contribution that voluntary\n                    employer action can make in eliminating the\n                    vestiges of discrimination in the workplace.\n\n          480 U.S. at 641-42.   Thus, I disagree with the majority's\n\fconclusion that \"there is no congressional recognition of\ndiversity as a Title VII objective requiring accommodation.\"\nMaj. Op. at 24.\n         To be sure, I can understand the majority's concern\nover allowing race to be a factor in any decision. History\nloudly proclaims the evil that can spring from such practices,\nand it is sometimes all too easy to simply ignore that evil when\nthe practice appears to be driven by a benign purpose. However,\nI do not believe that what the Board of Education was attempting\nto do here, nor the individualized manner in which it was\nattempting to do it, runs afoul of a Congressional enactment\ncloaked in the legislative history recounted herein, and in the\nopinions of my colleagues.\n         Not that long ago the President's Commission on Civil\nDisorders (the \"Kerner Commission\") warned that \"[o]ur nation is\nmoving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and\nunequal.\" Report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,\nat\n1 (March 1, 1968). Some may view the Board's efforts here as yet\nanother push in that direction. Indeed, if we were writing upon a\nclean slate that would no doubt be true. But of course, we do\nnot do that. The shadows and images that moved Congress to enact\nTitle VII in 1964 are already etched into our slate, and they\ndefine the reality that should guide our analysis. The Board has\nresponded to those shadows with an action that is a narrow,\nindividualized and reasoned attempt to foster respect for\ndiversity. Because that is consistent with the purposes of Title\nVII, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

Specifically, we must\ndecide whether Title VII permits an employer with a racially\nbalanced work force to grant a non-remedial racial preference in\norder to promote \"racial diversity\".\n         It is clear that the language of Title VII is violated\nwhen an employer makes an employment decision based upon an\nemployee's race. The Supreme Court determined in United\nSteelworkers v. Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), however, that Title\nVII's prohibition against racial discrimination is not violated\nby affirmative action plans which first, \"have purposes that\nmirror those of the statute\" and second, do not \"unnecessarily\ntrammel the interests of the [non-minority] employees,\" id. at\n208.\n         We hold that Piscataway's affirmative action policy is\nunlawful because it fails to satisfy either prong of Weber.\nGiven the clear antidiscrimination mandate of Title VII, a non-\nremedial affirmative action plan, even one with a laudable\npurpose, cannot pass muster. We will affirm the district court's\ngrant of summary judgment to Sharon Taxman.\n\nI.\n\f         In 1975, the Board of Education of the Township of\nPiscataway, New Jersey, developed an affirmative action policy\napplicable to employment decisions. The Board's Affirmative\nAction Program, a 52-page document, was originally adopted in\nresponse to a regulation promulgated by the New Jersey State\nBoard of Education. That regulation directed local school boards\nto adopt \"affirmative action programs,\" N.J. Admin. Code Tit. 6 §\n6:4-1.3(b), to address employment as well as school and classroom\npractices and to ensure equal opportunity to all persons\nregardless of race, color, creed, religion, sex or national\norigin. N.J. Admin. Code Tit. 6 §§ 6:4-1.5, 6:4-1.6(a). In 1983\nthe Board also adopted a one page \"Policy\", entitled \"Affirmative\nAction - Employment Practices.\" It is not clear from the record\nwhether the \"Policy\" superseded or simply added to the \"Program,\"\nnor does it matter for purposes of this appeal.\n         The 1975 document states that the purpose of the\nProgram is \"to provide equal educational opportunity for students\nand equal employment opportunity for employees and prospective\nemployees,\" and \"to make a concentrated effort to attract . . .\nminority personnel for all positions so that their qualifications\ncan be evaluated along with other candidates.\" The 1983 document\nstates that its purpose is to \"ensure[] equal employment\nopportunity . . . and prohibit[] discrimination in employment\nbecause of [,inter alia,] race. . . .\"\n         The operative language regarding the means by which\naffirmative-action goals are to be furthered is identical in the\ntwo documents. \"In all cases, the most qualified candidate will\nbe recommended for appointment. However, when candidates appear\nto be of equal qualification, candidates meeting the criteria of\nthe affirmative action program will be recommended.\" The phrase\n\"candidates meeting the criteria of the affirmative action\nprogram\" refers to members of racial, national origin or gender\ngroups identified as minorities for statistical reporting\npurposes by the New Jersey State Department of Education,\nincluding Blacks. The 1983 document also clarifies that the\naffirmative action program applies to \"every aspect of employment\nincluding . . . layoffs . . . .\"\n         The Board's affirmative action policy did not have \"any\nremedial purpose\"; it was not adopted \"with the intention of\nremedying the results of any prior discrimination or identified\nunderrepresentation of minorities within the Piscataway Public\nSchool System.\" At all relevant times, Black teachers were\nneither \"underrepresented\" nor \"underutilized\" in the Piscataway\nSchool District work force. Indeed, statistics in 1976 and 1985\nshowed that the percentage of Black employees in the job category\nwhich included teachers exceeded the percentage of Blacks in the\navailable work force.\n\n                                A.\n         In May, 1989, the Board accepted a recommendation from\nthe Superintendent of Schools to reduce the teaching staff in the\nBusiness Department at Piscataway High School by one. At that\ntime, two of the teachers in the department were of equal\nseniority, both having begun their employment with the Board on\n\fthe same day nine years earlier. One of those teachers was\nintervenor plaintiff Sharon Taxman, who is White, and the other\nwas Debra Williams, who is Black. Williams was the only minority\nteacher among the faculty of the Business Department.\n         Decisions regarding layoffs by New Jersey school boards\nare highly circumscribed by state law; nontenured faculty must be\nlaid off first, and layoffs among tenured teachers in the\naffected subject area or grade level must proceed in reverse\norder of seniority. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 18A:28-9 et seq.\nSeniority for this purpose is calculated according to specific\nguidelines set by state law. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 18A:28-10; N.J.\nAdmin. Code Tit. 6 § 6:3-5.1. Thus, local boards lack discretion\nto choose between employees for layoff, except in the rare\ninstance of a tie in seniority between the two or more employees\neligible to fill the last remaining position.\n         The Board determined that it was facing just such a\nrare circumstance in deciding between Taxman and Williams. In\nprior decisions involving the layoff of employees with equal\nseniority, the Board had broken the tie through \"a random process\nwhich included drawing numbers out of a container, drawing lots\nor having a lottery.\" In none of those instances, however, had\nthe employees involved been of different races.\n         In light of the unique posture of the layoff decision,\nSuperintendent of Schools Burton Edelchick recommended to the\nBoard that the affirmative action plan be invoked in order to\ndetermine which teacher to retain. Superintendent Edelchick made\nthis recommendation \"because he believed Ms. Williams and Ms.\nTaxman were tied in seniority, were equally qualified, and\nbecause Ms. Williams was the only Black teacher in the Business\nEducation Department.\"\n         While the Board recognized that it was not bound to\napply the affirmative action policy, it made a discretionary\ndecision to invoke the policy to break the tie between Williams\nand Taxman. As a result, the Board \"voted to terminate the\nemployment of Sharon Taxman, effective June 30, 1988. . . .\"\n         At her deposition, Paula Van Riper, the Board's Vice\nPresident at the time of the layoff, described the Board's\ndecision-making process. According to Van Riper, after the Board\nrecognized that Taxman and Williams were of equal seniority, it\nassessed their classroom performance, evaluations, volunteerism\nand certifications and determined that they were \"two teachers of\nequal ability\" and \"equal qualifications.\"\n         At his deposition Theodore H. Kruse, the Board's\nPresident, explained his vote to apply the affirmative action\npolicy as follows:\n         A.   Basically I think because I had been\n         aware that the student body and the community\n         which is our responsibility, the schools of\n         the community, is really quite diverse and\n         there -- I have a general feeling during my\n         tenure on the board that it was valuable for\n         the students to see in the various employment\n         roles a wide range of background, and that it\n         was also valuable to the work force and in\n\f         particular to the teaching staff that they\n         have -- they see that in each other.\n         Asked to articulate the \"educational objective\" served\nby retaining Williams rather than Taxman, Kruse stated:\n         A.   In my own personal perspective I believe\n         by retaining Mrs. Williams it was sending a\n         very clear message that we feel that our\n         staff should be culturally diverse, our\n         student population is culturally diverse and\n         there is a distinct advantage to students, to\n         all students, to be made -- come into contact\n         with people of different cultures, different\n         background, so that they are more aware, more\n         tolerant, more accepting, more understanding\n         of people of all background.\n\n         Q.   What do you mean by the phrase you used,\n         culturally diverse?\n\n         A.   Someone other than -- different than\n         yourself. And we have, our student\n         population and our community has people of\n         all different background, ethnic background,\n         religious background, cultural background,\n         and it's important that our school district\n         encourage awareness and acceptance and\n         tolerance and, therefore, I personally think\n         it's important that our staff reflect that\n         too.\n\n                                B.\n         Following the Board's decision, Taxman filed a charge\nof employment discrimination with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission. Attempts at conciliation were\nunsuccessful, and the United States filed suit under Title VII\nagainst the Board in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of New Jersey. Taxman intervened, asserting claims\nunder both Title VII and the New Jersey Law Against\nDiscrimination (NJLAD).\n         Following discovery, the Board moved for summary\njudgment and the United States and Taxman cross-moved for partial\nsummary judgment only as to liability. The district court denied\nthe Board's motion and granted partial summary judgment to the\nUnited States and Taxman, holding the Board liable under both\nstatutes for discrimination on the basis of race.

By this\ntime, Taxman had been rehired by the Board and thus her\nreinstatement was not an issue. The court awarded Taxman damages\nin the amount of $134,014.62 for backpay, fringe benefits and\nprejudgment interest under Title VII. A jury awarded an\nadditional $10,000 for emotional suffering under the NJLAD. The\ndistrict court denied the United States' request for a broadly\n\fworded injunction against future discrimination, finding that\nthere was no likelihood that the conduct at issue would recur,\nbut it did order the Board to give Taxman full seniority\nreflecting continuous employment from 1980. Additionally, the\ncourt dismissed Taxman's claim for punitive damages under the\nNJLAD.\n         The Board appealed, contending that the district court\nerred in granting Taxman summary judgment as to liability. The\nBoard also contends, in the alternative, that the court erred in\nawarding Taxman 100% backpay and in awarding prejudgment interest\nat the IRS rate rather than under 28 U.S.C. § 1961. Taxman\ncross-appealed, contending that the district court erred in\ndismissing her claim for punitive damages. Subsequently, the\nUnited States sought leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in\nsupport of reversal of the judgment, representing that it could\nno longer support the judgment of the district court. By order\nof November 17, 1995, we denied the United States' request. We\ntreated the position of the United States at the original\nargument before this court on January 24, 1995, as a motion to\nwithdraw as a party, which we granted. Thus, the only parties\nbefore us on this appeal are the Board and Taxman.\n         This court has jurisdiction over the appeals under 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.

In Weber, the Court\nconsidered a plan implemented by Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical\nCorporation. Prior to 1974, Kaiser hired as craftworkers only\nthose with prior craft experience. Id. at 198. Because they had\nlong been excluded from craft unions, Blacks were unable to\npresent the credentials required for craft positions. Id.\nMoreover, Kaiser's hiring practices, although not admittedly\n\fdiscriminatory with regard to minorities, were questionable. Id.at 210.\nAs a consequence, while the local labor force was about\n39% Black, Kaiser's labor force was less than 15% Black and its\ncrafts-work force was less than 2% Black. Id. at 198. In 1974,\nKaiser entered into a collective bargaining agreement which\ncontained an affirmative action plan. The plan reserved 50% of\nthe openings in an in-plant craft-training program for Black\nemployees until the percentage of Black craft-workers in the\nplant reached a level commensurate with the percentage of Blacks\nin the local labor force. Id. at 198. During the first year of\nthe plan's operation, 13 craft-trainees were selected, seven of\nwhom were Black and six of whom were White. Id. at 199.\n         Thereafter, Brian Weber, a White production worker,\nfiled a class action suit, alleging that the plan unlawfully\ndiscriminated against White employees under Title VII. Relying\nupon a literal reading of subsections 2000-3(2)(a) and (d) of\nthe Act, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-2(a), (d), and upon the Court's\ndecision in McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. at\n273, where the Court held that Title VII forbids discrimination\nagainst Whites as well as Blacks, the plaintiffs argued that it\nnecessarily followed that the Kaiser plan, which resulted in\njunior Black employees receiving craft training in preference to\nsenior White employees, violated Title VII. Id. at 199. The\ndistrict court agreed and entered a judgment in favor of the\nplaintiffs; the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\nId. at 200.\n         The Supreme Court, however, reversed, noting initially\nthat although the plaintiffs' argument was not \"without force\",\nit disregarded \"the significance of the fact that the Kaiser-USWA\nplan was an affirmative action plan voluntarily adopted by\nprivate parties to eliminate traditional patterns of racial\nsegregation.\" Id. at 201. The Court then embarked upon an\nexhaustive review of Title VII's legislative history and\nidentified Congress' concerns in enacting Title VII's prohibition\nagainst discrimination -- the deplorable status of Blacks in the\nnation's economy, racial injustice, and the need to open\nemployment opportunities for Blacks in traditionally closed\noccupations. Id. at 202-204. Against this background, the Court\nconcluded that Congress could not have intended to prohibit\nprivate employers from implementing programs directed toward the\nvery goal of Title VII -- the eradication of discrimination and\nits effects from the workplace:\n         It would be ironic indeed if a law triggered\n         by a Nation's concern over centuries of\n         racial injustice and intended to improve the\n         lot of those who had \"been excluded from the\n         American dream for so long,\" 110 Cong. Rec.\n         6552 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey),\n         constituted the first legislative prohibition\n         of all voluntary, private, race-conscious\n         efforts to abolish traditional patterns of\n         racial segregation and hierarchy.\n\nId. at 204.\n\f         The Court found support for its conclusion in the\nlanguage and legislative history of section 2000e-2(j) of Title\nVII which expressly provides that nothing in the Act requires\nemployers to grant racial preferences. According to the Court,\nthe opponents of Title VII had raised two arguments: the Act\nwould be construed to impose obligations upon employers to\nintegrate their work forces through preferential treatment of\nminorities, and even without being obligated to do so, employers\nwith racially imbalanced work forces would grant racial\npreferences. Id. at 205. Since Congress addressed only the\nfirst objection and did not specifically prohibit affirmative\naction efforts in section 2000e-2(j), the Court inferred that\nCongress did not intend that Title VII forbid all voluntary race-\nconscious preferences. Id. at 205-06. The Court further\nreasoned that since Congress also intended in section 2000e-2(j)\n\"to avoid undue federal regulation of private businesses,\" a\nprohibition against all voluntary affirmative action would\ndisserve this end by \"augment[ing] the power of the Federal\ngovernment and diminish[ing] traditional management prerogatives.\n. . .\" Id. at 206-07.\n         The Court then turned to the Kaiser plan in order to\ndetermine whether it fell on the \"permissible\" side of the \"line\nof demarcation between permissible and impermissible affirmative\naction plans.\" Id. at 208. The Court upheld the Kaiser plan\nbecause its purpose \"mirror[ed] those of the statute\" and it did\nnot \"unnecessarily trammel the interests of the [non-minority]\nemployees\":\n         The purposes of the plan mirror those of the\n         statute. Both were designed to break down\n         old patterns of racial segregation and\n         hierarchy. Both were structured to \"open\n         employment opportunities for Negroes in\n         occupations which have been traditionally\n         closed to them.\" 110 Cong. Rec. 6548 (1964)\n         (remarks of Sen. Humphrey).\n\n              At the same time, the plan does not\n         unnecessarily trammel the interests of the\n         white employees. The plan does not require\n         the discharge of white workers and their\n         replacement with new black hires. Nor does\n         the plan create an absolute bar to the\n         advancement of white employees; half of those\n         trained in the program will be white.\n         Moreover, the plan is a temporary measure; it\n         is not intended to maintain racial balance,\n         but simply to eliminate a manifest racial\n         imbalance.\n\nId. at 208 (citation and footnote omitted).\n         In 1987, the Supreme Court decided a second Title VII\naffirmative action case, Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa\nClara County, 480 U.S. at 616. There, the Santa Clara County\nTransit District Board of Supervisors implemented an affirmative\n\faction plan stating that \"`mere prohibition of discriminatory\npractices [was] not enough to remedy the effects of past\ndiscriminatory practices and to permit attainment of an equitable\nrepresentation of minorities, women and handicapped persons.'\"\nId. at 620. The plan noted that women were represented in\nnumbers far less than their proportion of the available work\nforce in the Agency as a whole and in the skilled craft worker\njob category relevant to the case, and observed that a lack of\nmotivation in women to seek training or employment where\nopportunities were limited partially explained the\nunderrepresentation. Id. at 621. The plan authorized the Agency\nto consider as one factor the gender of a qualified candidate in\nmaking promotions to positions with a traditionally segregated\njob classification in which women were significantly\nunderrepresented. Id. at 620-21. The plan did not set quotas,\nbut had as its long-term goal the attainment of a work force\nwhose composition reflected the proportion of women in the area\nlabor force. Id. at 621-22. Acknowledging the practical\ndifficulties in attaining the long-term goal, including the\nlimited number of qualified women, the plan counseled that short-\nrange goals be established and annually adjusted to serve as\nrealistic guides for actual employment decisions. Id. at 622.\n         On December 12, 1979, the Agency announced a vacancy\nfor the promotional position of road dispatcher. At the time,\nnone of the 238 positions in the applicable job category was\noccupied by a woman. Id. at 621. The Agency Director,\nauthorized to choose any of seven applicants who had been deemed\neligible, promoted Diane Joyce, a qualified woman, over Paul\nJohnson, a qualified man. Id. at 624-25. As the Agency Director\ntestified: \"`I tried to look at the whole picture, the\ncombination of her qualifications and Mr. Johnson's\nqualifications, their test scores, their expertise, their\nbackground, affirmative action matters, things like that . . . I\nbelieve it was a combination of all those.'\" Id. at 625.\n         Johnson sued, alleging that the Agency's employment\ndecision constituted unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII.\nEvaluating the plan against the criteria announced in Weber, the\ndistrict court held that the plan did not satisfy Weber's\ncriterion that the plan be temporary. Id. at 625. The Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that since the\nplan provided for the attainment, rather than the maintenance, of\na balanced work force, the absence of an express termination date\nin the plan was not dispositive of its validity. Id. at 625-26.\nThe court of appeals further held that the plan had been adopted\n\"to address a conspicuous imbalance in the Agency's work force,\nand neither unnecessarily trammeled the rights of other\nemployees, nor created an absolute bar to their advancement.\"\nId. at 626.\n         The Supreme Court affirmed. Declaring its prior\nanalysis in Weber controlling, the Court examined whether the\nemployment decision at issue \"was made pursuant to a plan\nprompted by concerns similar to those of the employer in Weber\"\nand whether \"the effect of the [p]lan on males and nonminorities\n\f[was] comparable to the effects of the plan in that case.\" Id.at 631.\nThe first issue the Court addressed, therefore, was\nwhether \"consideration of the sex of applicants for Skilled Craft\njobs was justified by the existence of a `manifest imbalance'\nthat reflected underrepresentation of women in `traditionally\nsegregated job categories.'\" Id. at 631 (quoting Weber, 433 U.S.\nat 197). Although the Court did not set forth a quantitative\nmeasure for determining what degree of disproportionate\nrepresentation in an employer's work force would be sufficient to\njustify affirmative action, it made clear that the terms\n\"manifest imbalance\" and \"traditionally segregated job category\"\nwere not tantamount to a prima facie case of discrimination\nagainst an employer since the constraints of Title VII and the\nFederal Constitution on voluntarily adopted affirmative action\nplans are not identical. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632. In this\nregard, the Court further reasoned that requiring an employer in\na Title VII affirmative action case to show that it had\ndiscriminated in the past \"would be inconsistent with Weber's\nfocus on statistical imbalance, and could inappropriately create\na significant discentive for employers to adopt an affirmative\naction plan\". Id. at 633 (footnote omitted).\n         Reviewing Agency statistics which showed that women\nwere concentrated in traditionally female jobs and represented a\nlower percentage in other jobs than would be expected if\ntraditional segregation had not occurred, the Court concluded\nthat the decision to promote Joyce was made pursuant to a plan\ndesigned to eliminate work force imbalances in traditionally\nsegregated job categories and thus satisfied Weber's first prong.\nId. at 634. Moving to Weber's second prong, whether the plan\nunnecessarily trammeled the rights of male employees, the Court\nconcluded that the plan passed muster because it authorized\nmerely that consideration be given to affirmative action concerns\nwhen evaluating applicants; gender was a \"plus\" factor, only one\nof several criteria that the Agency Director considered in making\nhis decision; no legitimate, firmly rooted expectation on the\npart of Johnson was denied since the Agency Director could have\npromoted any of the seven candidates classified as eligible; even\nthough Johnson was refused a promotion, he retained his\nemployment; and the plan was intended to attain a balanced work\nforce, not to maintain one. Id. at 638-40.\n\n                               III.\n         We analyze Taxman's claim of employment discrimination\nunder the approach set forth in McDonnell Douglas v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978). Once a plaintiff establishes a prima faciecase, the\nburden of production shifts to the employer to show a\nlegitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the decision; an\naffirmative action plan may be one such reason.

When the employer satisfies this requirement, the burden\nof production shifts back to the employee to show that the\nasserted nondiscriminatory reason is a pretext and that the\naffirmative action plan is invalid. Id.\n         For summary judgment purposes, the parties do not\n\fdispute that Taxman has established a prima facie case or that\nthe Board's decision to terminate her was based on its\naffirmative action policy. The dispositive liability issue,\ntherefore, is the validity of the Board's policy under Title VII.\n\n                               IV.\n         Having reviewed the analytical framework for assessing\nthe validity of an affirmative action plan as established in\nUnited Steelworkers v.

We look for\nthe purposes of Title VII in the plain meaning of the Act's\nprovisions and in its legislative history and historical context.\nSee Edward v. Aguillard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111924\"><a href=\"/opinion/111924/edwards-v-aguillard/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594-95 (1987) (in\ndetermining a statute's purpose, courts look to the statute's\nwords, legislative history, historical context and the sequence\nof events leading to its passage).\n\n                                A.\n         Title VII was enacted to further two primary goals: to\nend discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or\nnational origin, thereby guaranteeing equal opportunity in the\nworkplace, and to remedy the segregation and underrepresentation\nof minorities that discrimination has caused in our Nation's work\nforce.\n         Title VII's first purpose is set forth in section\n2000e-2's several prohibitions, which expressly denounce the\ndiscrimination which Congress sought to end. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a)-(d),(l); McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 800 (\"The language\nof Title VII makes plain the purpose of Congress to assure\nequality of employment opportunities and to eliminate those\ndiscriminatory practices and devices which have fostered racially\nstratified job environments to the disadvantage of minority\ncitizens.\").            This antidiscriminatory purpose is also reflected\nin the Act's legislative history. In an interpretative\nmemorandum entered into the Congressional Record, Senators Case\nand Clark, comanagers of the Senate bill, stated:\n         To discriminate is to make a distinction, to\n         make a difference in treatment or favor, and\n         those distinctions or differences in\n         treatment or favor which are prohibited by\n         section 704 are those which are based on any\n         five of the forbidden criteria: race, color,\n         religion, sex, and national origin. Any\n         other criterion or qualification for\n         employment is not affected by this title.\n\n                              * * *\n\n         . . . [Title VII] expressly protects the\n         employer's right to insist that any\n         prospective applicant, Negro or white, must\n         meet the applicable job qualifications.\n\f         Indeed the very purpose of Title VII is to\n         promote hiring on the basis of job\n         qualifications, rather than on the basis of\n         race or color.\n\n110 Cong. Rec. 7213, 7247 (1964), quoted in Price Waterhouse v.\nHopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (1989).\n         Title VII's second purpose, ending the segregative\neffects of discrimination, is revealed in the congressional\ndebate surrounding the statute's enactment. In Weber, the Court\ncarefully catalogued the comments made by the proponents of Title\nVII which demonstrate the Act's remedial concerns. Weber, 433\nU.S. at 202-04. By way of illustration, we cite Senator Clark's\nremarks to the Senate:\n         The rate of Negro unemployment has gone up\n         consistently as compared with white\n         unemployment for the past 15 years. This is\n         a social malaise and a social situation which\n         we should not tolerate. That is one of the\n         principal reasons why the bill should pass.\n\nId. (quoting 110 Cong. Rec. at 7220) (statement of Sen. Clark).\nLikewise, Senator Humphrey spoke of the Nation's need \"`to open\nemployment opportunities for Negroes which have been\ntraditionally closed to them,'\" and to assist those who have\n\"`been excluded from the American dream for so long[.]'\" Id.(quoting 110\nCong. Rec. at 6548, 6552) (statements of Sen.\nHumphrey).\n         The significance of this second corrective purpose\ncannot be overstated. It is only because Title VII was written\nto eradicate not only discrimination per se but the consequencesof prior\ndiscrimination as well, that racial preferences in the\nform of affirmative action can co-exist with the Act's\nantidiscrimination mandate.\n         Thus, based on our analysis of Title VII's two goals,\nwe are convinced that unless an affirmative action plan has a\nremedial purpose, it cannot be said to mirror the purposes of the\nstatute, and, therefore, cannot satisfy the first prong of the\nWeber test.\n         We see this case as one involving straightforward\nstatutory interpretation controlled by the text and legislative\nhistory of Title VII as interpreted in Weber and Johnson. The\nstatute on its face provides that race cannot be a factor in\nemployer decisions about hires, promotions, and layoffs, and the\nlegislative history demonstrates that barring considerations of\nrace from the workplace was Congress' primary objective. If\nexceptions to this bar are to be made, they must be made on the\nbasis of what Congress has said. The affirmative action plans at\nissue in Weber and Johnson were sustained only because the\nSupreme Court, examining those plans in light of congressional\nintent, found a secondary congressional objective in Title VII\nthat had to be accommodated -- i.e., the elimination of the\neffects of past discrimination in the workplace. Here, there is\nno congressional recognition of diversity as a Title VII\n\fobjective requiring accommodation.\n         Accordingly, it is beyond cavil that the Board, by\ninvoking its affirmative action policy to lay off Sharon Taxman,\nviolated the terms of Title VII. While the Court in Weber and\nJohnson permitted some deviation from the antidiscrimination\nmandate of the statute in order to erase the effects of past\ndiscrimination, these rulings do not open the door to additional\nnon-remedial deviations. Here, as in Weber and Johnson, the\nBoard must justify its deviation from the statutory mandate based\non positive legislative history, not on its idea of what is\nappropriate.\n\n                                B.\n         The Board recognizes that there is no positive\nlegislative history supporting its goal of promoting racial\ndiversity \"for education's sake\", and concedes that there is no\ncaselaw approving such a purpose to support an affirmative action\nplan under Title VII. \"[T]he Board would have [us] infer the\npropriety of this purpose from fragments of other authority.\"\nBoard of Educ. of Township of Piscataway, 832 F. Supp. at 845.\n         The Board first attempts to meet its obligations with\nrespect to Title VII by arguing that Congress meant to cover the\nsituation presented here \"when it amended Title VII in 1972 to\ncover academic institutions public and private.\" A review of a\nSenate Committee's explanation for recommending the amendment,\nhowever, reveals that Congress neither addressed nor embraced the\nracial diversity purpose before us. Instead, Congress pursued,\nin Title VII's 1972 amendment with regard to the nation's\nschools, the same purposes it had pursued in 1964 when enacting\nthe original statute with respect to other employers, namely, the\nelimination of discriminatory employment practices and the\nabolition of discrimination's invidious effects:\n              The presence of discrimination in the\n         Nation's educational institutions is no\n         secret. . . . This discrimination, however,\n         is not limited to the students alone.\n         Discriminatory practices against faculty,\n         staff, and other employees is also common.\n\n              As in other areas of employment,\n         statistics for educational institutions\n         indicate that minorities and women are\n         precluded from the more prestigious and\n         higher-paying positions, and are relegated to\n         the more menial and lower-paying jobs. While\n         in elementary and secondary school systems\n         Negroes accounted for approximately 10% of\n         the total number of positions in the higher-\n         paying and more prestigious positions in\n         institutions of higher learning, blacks\n         constituted only 2.2% of all positions, most\n         of these being found in all-black or\n         predominantly black institutions. Women are\n         similarly subject to discriminatory patterns.\n\f         Not only are they generally under-represented\n         in institutions of higher learning, but those\n         few that do obtain positions are generally\n         paid less and advanced more slowly than their\n         male counterparts. Similarly, while women\n         constitute 67% of elementary and secondary\n         school teachers, out of 778,000 elementary\n         and secondary school principals, 78% of\n         elementary school principals are men and 94%\n         of secondary school principals are men.\n\n              . . . There is nothing in the\n         legislative background of Title VII, nor does\n         any national policy suggest itself, to\n         support the present exemption. In fact, the\n         Committee believes that the existence of\n         discrimination in educational institutions is\n         particularly critical. It is difficult to\n         imagine a more sensitive area than\n         educational institutions, where the youth of\n         the Nation are exposed to a multitude of\n         ideas and impressions that will strongly\n         influence their future development. To\n         permit discrimination here would, more than\n         in any other area, tend to promote existing\n         misconceptions and stereotypical\n         categorizations which in turn would lead to\n         future patterns of discrimination.\n\nS.Rep. 415, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1971). See Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 627-28 n.6 (\"While public employers were not added to the\ndefinition of `employer' in Title VII until 1972, there is no\nevidence that this mere addition to the definitional section of\nthe statute was intended to transform the substantive standard\ngoverning employer conduct.\").\n         We find the Board's reliance on Fourteenth Amendment\ncaselaw misplaced as well. We are acutely aware, as is the\nBoard, that the federal courts have never decided a \"pure\" Title\nVII case where racial diversity for education's sake was advanced\nas the sole justification for a race-based decision. The Board\nargues that in deciding just such a case, we should look to the\nSupreme Court's endorsement of diversity as a goal in the Equal\nProtection context. This argument, however, is based upon a\nfaulty premise.\n         In relying on Equal Protection cases to support its\ndiversity goal, we understand the Board to reason as follows:\nThe Supreme Court observed in Johnson that \"the statutory\nprohibition [in Title VII] with which an employer must contend\nwas not intended to extend as far as that of the Constitution\",\n480 U.S. at 628 n.6. Accordingly, a purpose which survives\nconstitutional strict scrutiny necessarily passes muster under\nTitle VII's permissible purpose test -- since the Court has\nendorsed the concept of diversity in Equal Protection cases, it\nwould approve the Board's diversity purpose in this Title VII\n\fcase, where the limitations on purpose are less stringent.\n         We are convinced, however, that Johnson's footnote six,\n480 U.S. at 627-28 n.6, in which the Court contrasted the reach\nof Title VII with that of the Constitution, does not speak to the\npurposes that may support affirmative action under the former but\nnot the latter. We read the Court's observation to relate,\ninstead, to the factual predicate that employers must offer to\nprove the need for remedial efforts in Title VII as contrasted\nwith Equal Protection affirmative action cases.\n         In Johnson, the Court held that the legality of the\nSanta Clara County Transportation Agency's plan under Title VII\nmust be guided by the Court's determination in Weber that\naffirmative action is lawful if an employer can point to a\n\"`manifest imbalance . . . in traditionally segregated job\ncategories.'\" 480 U.S. at 630-32 (quoting Weber, 433 U.S. at\n197). In Wygant v.

In the plurality's\nwords, affirmative action must be supported by \"a factual\ndetermination that the employer had a strong basis in evidence\nfor its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.\" Id. at\n277.\n         When the Court in Johnson observed that Title VII's\nstatutory prohibition does not extend as far as the Constitution,\nit was addressing one of Justice Scalia's arguments in dissent\nthat since obligations under Title VII and the Constitution are\nidentical, a public employer's adoption of an affirmative action\nplan in a Title VII case should be governed by the prior\ndiscrimination standard set forth in Wygant. Johnson, 480 U.S.\nat 627-28 n.6.\n\n         While the Supreme Court may indeed at some future date\nhold that an affirmative action purpose that satisfies the\nConstitution must necessarily satisfy Title VII, it has yet to do\nso.\n         Were we to accept that equal protection standards may\nbe imported into Title VII analysis, we are still unpersuaded\nthat the Equal Protection caselaw validates the Board's asserted\ngoal of racial diversity. We cannot agree with the Board that\nthe racial diversity purpose is supported by both the Supreme\nCourt's holding and the dissenting opinions in Wygant. The Court\nin Wygant, although divided, agreed that under the Equal\nProtection Clause, racial classifications in the context of\naffirmative action must be justified by a compelling state\npurpose and the means chosen to effectuate that purpose must be\nnarrowly tailored; that societal discrimination alone will not\njustify a racial classification; that evidence of prior\ndiscrimination by an employer must be presented before remedial\nracial classifications can be employed; and that the \"role model\"\ntheory proposed by the employer as a basis for race-conscious\n\fstate action was unacceptable because it would have allowed\ndiscriminatory hiring and layoff well beyond the point necessary\nfor any remedial purpose and did not bear any relationship to the\nharm caused by prior discrimination. Id. at 270-78; id. at 284-\n93 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\nCourt's judgment); id. at 294-95 (White, J., concurring in the\nCourt's judgment). The dissenting Justices believed that the\nConstitution would allow a public employer to preserve the\nintegration it had achieved through a legitimate affirmative\naction hiring plan by thereafter apportioning layoffs between\nminority and nonminority groups. Id. at 306 (Marshall, J.,\ndissenting, joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ.); id. at 267-68\n(Stevens, J., dissenting).\n         We are also unpersuaded by the Board's contention that\nEqual Protection cases arising in an education context support\nupholding the Board's purpose in a Title VII action. These Equal\nProtection cases, unlike the case at hand, involved corrective\nefforts to confront racial segregation or chronic minority\nunderrepresentation in the schools. In this context, we are not\nat all surprised that the goal of diversity was raised. While we\nwholeheartedly endorse any statements in these cases extolling\nthe educational value of exposing students to persons of diverse\nraces and backgrounds, given the framework in which they were\nmade, we cannot accept them as authority for the conclusion that\nthe Board's non-remedial racial diversity goal is a permissible\nbasis for affirmative action under Title VII.

Bakke involved\na rejected White applicant's challenge under the Constitution and\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, to a\nspecial admissions program instituted by the Medical School of\nthe University of California at Davis which essentially set aside\n\f16 places for minority candidates. Justice Powell, whose vote\nwas necessary both to establish the validity of considering race\nin admission decisions and to invalidate the racial quota before\nthe Court, was of the opinion that the attainment of a \"diverse\nstudent body\" is a constitutionally permissible goal for an\ninstitution of higher education. Justice Powell pointed out that\nthe academic freedom that has been viewed as a \"special concern\"\nof the First Amendment includes \"the freedom of a university to\nmake its own judgments as to the selection of its student body\"\nand that \"[t]he atmosphere of `speculation, experiment and\ncreation' -- so essential to the quality of higher education --\nis widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body.\"\nBakke, 438 U.S. at 312 (footnote omitted). He then agreed with\nDavis' assertion that its interest in diversity implicated First\nAmendment concerns:\n              Thus, in arguing that its universities\n         must be accorded the right to select those\n         students who will contribute the most to the\n         \"robust exchange of ideas,\" [Davis] invokes a\n         countervailing constitutional interest, that\n         of the First Amendment. In this light,\n         petitioner must be viewed as seeking to\n         achieve a goal that is of paramount\n         importance in the fulfillment of its mission.\n\nId. at 313.\n         Davis' reservation of a specified number of seats in\neach class for individuals from preferred ethnic groups to\nfurther its diversity purpose, however, was unacceptable because,\naccording to Justice Powell, it misconceived the nature of the\nstate interest that would justify consideration of race or ethnic\nbackground:\n         It is not an interest in simple ethnic\n         diversity, in which a specified percentage of\n         the student body is in effect guaranteed to\n         be members of selected ethnic groups, with\n         the remaining percentage an undifferentiated\n         aggregation of students. The diversity that\n         furthers a compelling state interest\n         encompasses a far broader array of\n         qualifications and characteristics of which\n         racial or ethnic origin is but a single\n         though important element. Davis' special\n         admissions program, focused solely on ethnic\n         diversity, would hinder rather than further\n         attainment of genuine diversity.\n\nId. at 315 (footnote omitted).\n         Bakke's factual and legal setting, as well as the\ndiversity that universities aspire to in their student bodies,\nare, in our view, so different from the facts, relevant law and\nthe racial diversity purpose involved in this case that we find\nlittle in Bakke to guide us.\n         Likewise, statements regarding the value of programming\n\fdiversity made by the Court in Metro Broadcasting when it upheld\ntwo minority preference policies adopted by the Federal\nCommunications Commission, 497 U.S. at 547, have no application\nhere. The diversity interest the Court found sufficient under\nthe Constitution to support a racial classification had nothing\nwhatsoever to do with the concerns that underlie Title VII.\nCiting Bakke, the Court concluded that \"[j]ust as a `diverse\nstudent body' contributing to a `robust exchange of ideas' is a\n`constitutionally permissible goal' on which a race-conscious\nuniversity admissions program may be predicated, the diversity of\nviews and information on the airwaves serves important First\nAmendment values.\" Id. at 568 (citation omitted).\n         Finally, we turn to the Board's argument that the\ndiversity goal underlying its application of the affirmative\naction policy was endorsed in Justice O'Connor's concurring\nopinion in Wygant and in Justice Stevens' concurring opinion in\nJohnson. We find that these statements are slender reeds indeed\nand any bearing that they may have in the situation presented\nhere is minimal. While Justice O'Connor did refer favorably to\nBakke and the notion of racial diversity in institutions of\nhigher learning, Wygant, 480 U.S. at 286 (O'Connor J.\nconcurring), just one year later in Johnson, a Title VII case,\nshe rejected Justice Steven's expansive view of the purposes that\nmay underlie affirmative action, stating: \"[C]ontrary to the\nintimations in JUSTICE STEVENS' concurrence, this Court did not\napprove preferences for minorities `for any reason that might\nseem sensible from a business or social point of view.'\"\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 649 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the Court's\njudgment). As for Justice Stevens' concurrence in Johnson, while\nhe clearly pondered the idea of \"forward-looking\" affirmative\naction where employers do not focus on \"`purg[ing] their own past\nsins of discrimination'\", id. at 647 (Stevens, J., concurring),\nhis comments are not controlling.\n\n                                V.\n         Since we have not found anything in the Board's\narguments to convince us that this case requires examination\nbeyond statutory interpretation, we return to the point at which\nwe started: the language of Title VII itself and the two cases\nreviewing affirmative action plans in light of that statute. Our\nanalysis of the statute and the caselaw convinces us that a non-\nremedial affirmative action plan cannot form the basis for\ndeviating from the antidiscrimination mandate of Title VII.\n         The Board admits that it did not act to remedy the\neffects of past employment discrimination. The parties have\nstipulated that neither the Board's adoption of its affirmative\naction policy nor its subsequent decision to apply it in choosing\nbetween Taxman and Williams was intended to remedy the results of\nany prior discrimination or identified underrepresentation of\nBlacks within the Piscataway School District's teacher workforce\nas a whole. Nor does the Board contend that its action here was\ndirected at remedying any de jure or de facto segregation. Butsee\nPiscataway Township Bd. of Educ. v. Burke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1936278\"><a href=\"/opinion/1936278/piscataway-tp-board-of-education-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.J.\nSuper.

Even though the Board's race-conscious action was taken\nto avoid what could have been an all-White faculty within the\nBusiness Department, the Board concedes that Blacks are not\nunderrepresented in its teaching workforce as a whole or even in\nthe Piscataway High School.\n         Rather, the Board's sole purpose in applying its\naffirmative action policy in this case was to obtain an\neducational benefit which it believed would result from a\nracially diverse faculty. While the benefits flowing from\ndiversity in the educational context are significant indeed, we\nare constrained to hold, as did the district court, that inasmuch\nas \"the Board does not even attempt to show that its affirmative\naction plan was adopted to remedy past discrimination or as the\nresult of a manifest imbalance in the employment of minorities,\"\n832 F. Supp. at 845, the Board has failed to satisfy the first\nprong of the Weber test. United States v.

[nonminority] interests.\n. . .\" Weber, 433 U.S. at 208. Under this requirement, too, the\nBoard's policy is deficient.\n         We begin by noting the policy's utter lack of\ndefinition and structure. While it is not for us to decide how\nmuch diversity in a high school facility is \"enough,\" the Board\ncannot abdicate its responsibility to define \"racial diversity\"\nand to determine what degree of racial diversity in the\nPiscataway School is sufficient.\n         The affirmative action plans that have met with the\nSupreme Court's approval under Title VII had objectives, as well\nas benchmarks which served to evaluate progress, guide the\nemployment decisions at issue and assure the grant of only those\nminority preferences necessary to further the plans' purpose.\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 621-22 (setting forth long-range and short-\nterm objectives to achieve \"`a statistically measurable yearly\nimprovement in hiring, training and promotion of minorities and\nwomen . . . in all major job classifications where they are\nunderrepresented'\"); Weber, 433 U.S. at 193 (reserving for Black\nemployees 50% of the openings in craft-training programs until\nthe percentage of Black craftworkers reflected the percentage of\nBlacks in the available labor force). By contrast, the Board's\npolicy, devoid of goals and standards, is governed entirely by\nthe Board's whim, leaving the Board free, if it so chooses, to\ngrant racial preferences that do not promote even the policy's\nclaimed purpose. Indeed, under the terms of this policy, the\nBoard, in pursuit of a \"racially diverse\" work force, could use\naffirmative action to discriminate against those whom Title VII\nwas enacted to protect. Such a policy unnecessarily trammels the\ninterests of nonminority employees.\n          Moreover, both Weber and Johnson unequivocally provide\nthat valid affirmative action plans are \"temporary\" measures that\nseek to \"'attain'\", not \"maintain\" a \"permanent racial . . .\nbalance.\" Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639-40. See Weber, 433 U.S. at\n208. The Board's policy, adopted in 1975, is an established\n\ffixture of unlimited duration, to be resurrected from time to\ntime whenever the Board believes that the ratio between Blacks\nand Whites in any Piscataway School is skewed. On this basis\nalone, the policy contravenes Weber's teaching. See Cunico v.\nPueblo School Dist. No. 60, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550366\"><a href=\"/opinion/550366/connie-cunico-v-pueblo-school-district-no-60-a-public-corporation-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440 (10th Cir. 1990)\n(holding that the school district's layoff decision aimed at\nensuring the employment of the district's only Black\nadministrator was \"outright racial balancing\" in violation of\nWeber's second prong).\n          Finally, we are convinced that the harm imposed upon a\nnonminority employee by the loss of his or her job is so\nsubstantial and the cost so severe that the Board's goal of\nracial diversity, even if legitimate under Title VII, may not be\npursued in this particular fashion. This is especially true\nwhere, as here, the nonminority employee is tenured. In Weberand Johnson,\nwhen considering whether nonminorities were unduly\nencumbered by affirmative action, the Court found it significant\nthat they retained their employment. Weber, 433 U.S. at 208\n(observing that the plan did not require the discharge of\nnonminority workers); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638 (observing that\nthe nonminority employee who was not promoted nonetheless kept\nhis job). We, therefore, adopt the plurality's pronouncement in\nWygant that \"[w]hile hiring goals impose a diffuse burden, often\nforeclosing only one of several opportunities, layoffs impose the\nentire burden of achieving racial equality on particular\nindividuals, often resulting in serious disruption of their\nlives. That burden is too intrusive.\" Wygant, 476 U.S. at 283\n(footnote omitted).\n         Accordingly, we conclude that under the second prong of\nthe Weber test, the Board's affirmative action policy violates\nTitle VII. In addition to containing an impermissible purpose,\nthe policy \"unnecessarily trammel[s] the interests of the\n[nonminority] employees.\" Weber, 430 U.S. at 208.\n\n                               VI.\n         The district court did not analyze Taxman's claims\nbased on the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination and we need\nnot do so in detail here. The parties have agreed that the legal\nanalysis required by the state statute is essentially the same as\nthat undertaken in Title VII cases. While the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt has yet to consider a voluntarily adopted affirmative\naction plan in light of the NJLAD, it is undisputed that the\nNJLAD has been interpreted to parallel Title VII. In Peper v.\nPrinceton Univ.

Analysis of this case under the NJLAD would, therefore,\nlead to the same result as that which we have reached under Title\nVII. Sharon Taxman is entitled to summary judgment on her claim\nmade under the NJLAD.\n\f                               VII.\n         Having found the Board liable under Title VII, we turn\nour attention to the issue of damages, addressing first the\ndistrict court's order that Taxman be awarded one hundred percent\nbackpay for the entire period of her layoff.

Taxman, therefore, would\nhave stood no more than a fifty percent chance of keeping her job\nhad there been no unlawful discrimination.\"\n         We disagree.

While Taxman cannot be\nreturned to the position that she held prior to her layoff -- one\nof virtually precise equality with Williams in terms of the\nfactors relevant to the decision -- she can be returned to a\nposition of financial equality with Williams through a one\nhundred percent backpay award. We are convinced that this award\nmost closely approximates the conditions that would have\nprevailed in the absence of discrimination.\n         We find an additional basis for our holding in the\nanalysis set forth in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1989). In that case, the Supreme Court held that where an\nemployee proves that discrimination played a role in an\nemployment decision, the employer will not be found \"liable if it\ncan prove that, even if it had not taken [race] into account it\nwould have come to the same decision regarding a particular\nperson.\" Id. at 242. Here, Taxman has clearly established that\nthe Board is liable and that she was not paid during the relevant\nperiod. Under the logic of Hopkins, the Board cannot avoid a one\nhundred percent backpay award unless it can establish, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that Taxman would have received\nsome lesser amount had the Board not taken race into account.\nThis, of course, the Board cannot do.\n         Given the law and the circumstances presented in this\ncase, we are convinced that the district court's analysis with\nrespect to backpay reflects the sound exercise of judicial\ndiscretion and we will affirm the award.\n         The Board further contends that the district court\nerred in calculating prejudgment interest using the IRS adjusted\nprime rate. According to the Board, the district court should\nhave applied the post-judgment rate set forth in 28 U.S.C. §\n1961(a). This argument is meritless.\n         The matter of prejudgment interest is left to the\ndiscretion of the district court.

The court made the following comment with respect to\npunitive damages:\n         I didn't say I felt the board -- I may have\n         said that the board acted in good faith, but\n         I think what I did say is that there's no\n         evidence that would support any claim for\n         punitive damages. And I struck the punitive\n         damages claim.\n\n         There's absolutely no evidence that the board\n         acted willfully, wantonly, outrageously or in\n         any other way than trying its best to make\n         the best of a very unhappy situation.\n\n         The New Jersey Supreme Court has established a high\nthreshold requirement which must be met before an award of\npunitive damages can be sustained. Punitive damages are to be\nawarded only \"`when the wrongdoer's conduct is especially\negregious.'\" Rendine v.

Our disposition of this\nmatter, however, rests squarely on the foundation of Title VII.\nAlthough we applaud the goal of racial diversity, we cannot agree\nthat Title VII permits an employer to advance that goal through\nnon-remedial discriminatory measures.\n         Having found that the district court properly concluded\nthat the affirmative action plan applied by the Board to lay off\nTaxman is invalid under Title VII, and that the district court\ndid not err in calculating Taxman's damages or in dismissing her\nclaim for punitive damages, we will affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n        TAXMAN v.

I join\nthe remainder of the court's opinion.\nUnited States of America, Sharon Taxman, Plaintiff-Intervenor\nv. Bd. of Education of the Township of Piscataway,\nSharon Taxman, Appellant v. Bd. of Education of the Township of\nPiscataway, Nos. 94-5090, 94-5112\n\nSLOVITER, Chief Judge, dissenting, with whom Judges Lewis and\nMcKee join.\n         In the law, as in other professions, it is often how\nthe question is framed that determines the answer that is\nreceived. Although the divisive issue of affirmative action\ncontinues on this country's political agenda, I do not see this\nappeal as raising a broad legal referendum on affirmative action\npolicies. Indeed, it is questionable whether this case is about\naffirmative action at all, as that term has come to be generally\nunderstood -- i.e. preference based on race or gender of one\ndeemed \"less qualified\" over one deemed \"more qualified.\" Nor\ndoes this case even require us to examine the parameters of the\naffirmative action policy originally adopted in 1975 by the Board\n\fof Education of the Township of Piscataway (School Board or\nBoard) in response to a state regulation requiring affirmative\naction programs or the Board's concise 1983 one-page Affirmative\nAction policy.\n         Instead, the narrow question posed by this appeal can\nbe restated as whether Title VII requires a New Jersey school or\nschool board, which is faced with deciding which of two equally\nqualified teachers should be laid off, to make its decision\nthrough a coin toss or lottery, a solution that could be expected\nof the state's gaming tables, or whether Title VII permits the\nschool board to factor into the decision its bona fide belief,\nbased on its experience with secondary schools, that students\nderive educational benefit by having a Black faculty member in an\notherwise all-White department. Because I believe that the area\nof discretion left to employers in educational institutions by\nTitle VII encompasses the School Board's action in this case, I\nrespectfully dissent.\n         The posture in which the legal issue in this case is\npresented is so stripped of extraneous factors that it could well\nserve as the question for a law school moot court. I emphasize\nat the outset issues that this case does not present. We need\nnot decide whether it is permissible for a school to lay off a\nmore qualified employee in favor of a less qualified employee on\nthe basis of race, because that did not happen here. Nor need we\nconsider what requirements Title VII may impose on unwilling\nemployers, or how much racial diversity in a high school faculty\nmay be \"enough.\"\n         Significantly, although the School Board is a public\nemployer, this case does not place before us for decision the\nlimits on race-conscious action imposed on public entities by the\nConstitution because we are presented with no constitutional\nclaim. Therefore, we must measure the Board's actions under the\nrestraints imposed by Title VII rather than the more demanding\nones imposed on government action by the Equal Protection Clause.\nIn this respect the case is similar to that presented in Johnson\nv. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1987), where the Supreme Court noted that even though the\ndefendant was a public employer it would decide the case only\nunder Title VII because no constitutional issue was raised or\naddressed below. See id. at 620 n.2. The Court also made clear\nthat for purposes of Title VII, the same standard applies to\npublic and private employers, stating that \"[t]he fact that a\npublic employer must also satisfy the Constitution does not\nnegate the fact that the statutory prohibition with which that\nemployer must contend was not intended to extend as far as that\nof the Constitution.\" Id. at 628 n.6. This was an express\nrejection of Justice Scalia's contention \"that the obligations of\na public employer under Title VII must be identical to its\nobligations under the Constitution.\" Id. at 627 n. 6; see alsoid. at 649\n(O'Connor, J., concurring). Thus it is important to\nkeep in mind that we must measure the Board's action in this case\nagainst the same standard we would apply to a private school.\n\nI.\n\f         When in May 1989 the School Board was faced with the\ndisagreeable necessity of reducing by one the teaching staff in\nthe Business Department of Piscataway High School, it recognized\nthat reference to the applicable New Jersey law, which provides\nthe roadmap in terms of seniority, would not suffice here because\nthe two teachers had equal seniority. The Board, which has the\nresponsibility of gauging the educational requirements of the\nstudents under its charge, would have to resort to its own\nexperience as there were no other prescribed guidelines. It did\nnot then turn to the affirmative action policy to make the\ndecision based on race. There was no built-in quota, expressed\nor implied, for minority faculty, and Taxman does not so suggest.\nOn the contrary, the Board next considered a variety of\nundoubtedly relevant factors, any one of which might have tipped\nthe scales in favor of laying off one teacher or the other. Had\nTaxman been deemed a better teacher than Williams, that alone\ncould have pointed the arrow in her direction. Or, had Williams\nparticipated in volunteer activity while Taxman spent her spare\ntime in other activities, that alone could have accounted for\nWilliams' retention. The deposition testimony of several board\nmembers who participated in the decision indicates that before\nthe affirmative action policy was considered, a number of other\ncriteria were discussed to break the tie, including work\nperformance, certifications, evaluations, teaching ability, and\nvolunteerism. The two teachers with the least seniority, Taxman\nand Williams, were determined to be equal with respect to each of\nthese other criteria.\n         The Board's Vice President, Paula Van Riper, testified:\n         [T]he seniority and the person's\n         qualifications came into play first. If one\n         was more senior than the other, it would have\n         ended right there, if they were of like\n         seniority. From that point it was based on\n         their work performance and their evaluations\n         . . . . There was some consideration given\n         . . . to the various other activities that\n         they did . . . . But certainly the weight\n         would be given to their performance in the\n         classroom. At that point we were told that\n         these are two teachers of equal ability,\n         equal qualifications, I should say. They\n         . . . both[] had good evaluations, they were\n         good teachers, they were supportive of the\n         school district, volunteered in various ways\n         and they . . . had similar certification or\n         like certification and their seniority was\n         the same so therefore they were equal.\n\n\nDa179-80.\n         The equal position of both teachers in light of all\nrelevant criteria was also stressed by the Director of Personnel,\nGordon Moore, who explained: \"we . . . concluded that work\nhistory or performance criteria [were] not going to be usable in\n\fbreaking the tie, because there was no distinction that could be\nmade.\" Da177.\n         In its opinion, the majority declares the School\nBoard's affirmative action policy unlawful. An examination of\nthe so-called affirmative action policy reveals that it does\nnothing more than place before the School Board the need to\nconsider minority personnel among other equally qualifiedcandidates for\nemployment decisions. Da5, 53. That this was a\nnecessary reminder in 1975 when the policy was formed can hardly\nbe gainsaid. I believe that it also was a useful reminder in\n1989, when this School Board was faced with this decision, and\nperhaps even today.\n         A review of the record makes clear that the Board did\nnot view itself as bound to select Williams for retention by the\n1975 affirmative action policy, which speaks only of\nrecommendations, but after discussion and consideration the Board\nmade a discretionary decision to select Williams for retention to\nfurther the educational goal of a diverse faculty. Da72, 94.\n         The Board members described their purpose in using the\ngoal of diversity underlying the previously adopted affirmative\naction policy as a factor in the layoff decision as reflecting\nthe \"general feeling . . . that it was valuable for the students\nto see in the various employment roles a wide range of\nbackground[s],\" Da74, and \"the desire to have a diverse teaching\nstaff in the school district.\" Da175-76. It was also intended\nto send \"a very clear message that we feel that our staff should\nbe culturally diverse [for the benefit of the students]\" and to\n\"encourage awareness and acceptance and tolerance [of people of\nall backgrounds].\" Da75. Thus, the Board took into\nconsideration that if Williams were laid off, the Business\nDepartment faculty at the school would be all White. Da94, 110,\n168, 175-176.\n                               II.\n         It was the Board's decision to include the desire for a\nracially diverse faculty among the various factors entering into\nits discretionary decision that the majority of this court brands\na Title VII violation as a matter of law. No Supreme Court case\ncompels that anomalous result. Notwithstanding the majority's\nliteral construction of the language of Title VII, no Supreme\nCourt case has ever interpreted the statute to preclude\nconsideration of race or sex for the purpose of insuring\ndiversity in the classroom as one of many factors in an\nemployment decision, the situation presented here. Moreover, in\nthe only two instances in which the Supreme Court examined under\nTitle VII, without the added scrutiny imposed by the Equal\nProtection Clause, affirmative action plans voluntarily adopted\nby employers that gave preference to race or sex as a\ndeterminative factor, the Court upheld both plans.\n         In its 1979 decision in United Steelworkers v. Weber,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), the Court held that an agreement between a\nprivate company and a union that sought to remedy the historical\nexclusion of Blacks from skilled craft unions by reserving half\nthe openings in an in-house training program for Blacks did not\nviolate Title VII. A scarce decade later, it reached a similar\n\fdecision in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), where the plan that the Court upheld\nauthorized consideration of the gender of a qualified applicant\nas one of various factors for promoting employees into jobs in\nwhich women had been significantly underrepresented.\n         The majority presents Weber and Johnson as if their\nsignificance lies in the obstacle course they purportedly\nestablish for any employer adopting an affirmative action\nprogram.   But, as the Justices of the Supreme Court recognized,\nthe significance of each of those cases is that the Supreme Court\nsustained the affirmative action plans presented, and in doing so\ndeviated from the literal interpretation of Title VII precluding\nuse of race or gender in any employment action. As Justice\nBrennan explained in Weber, \"It is a 'familiar rule that a thing\nmay be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the\nstatute, because not within its spirit nor within the intention\nof its makers.'\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 201 (quoting Holy Trinity\nChurch v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93280\"><a href=\"/opinion/93280/church-of-holy-trinity-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 459 (1892)). The Justices\ndissenting in those cases noted and vigorously objected to the\ndeparture. See, e.g., Weber, 443 U.S. at 222, 228 (Rehnquist,\nJ., dissenting) (asserting that the majority \"eludes the clear\nstatutory language\" and that Kaiser's affirmative action plan is\n\"flatly prohibited by the plain language of Title VII\"); Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 670 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"It is well to keep in\nmind just how thoroughly Weber rewrote the statute it purported\nto construe . . . Weber disregarded the text of the statute,\ninvoking instead its 'spirit'\").\n         While the majority in this case views the Supreme\nCourt's articulation of the factors that rationalized its\nupholding of the affirmative action plans in those cases as\nestablishing boundaries, no language in either Weber or Johnsonso states\nand, in fact, there is language to the contrary. The\nmajority draws the line at the factors used in those cases. In\nboth Weber and Johnson, the Court inquired whether consideration\nof race in the employment decision was justified by a permissible\npurpose, and then examined the effect on nonminorities to\nascertain whether the action taken \"unnecessarily trammel[ed] the\ninterests of the white employees.\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 208;\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 630.\n         However, it does not follow as a matter of logic that\nbecause the two affirmative action plans in Weber and Johnsonwhich sought\nto remedy imbalances caused by past discrimination\nwithstood Title VII scrutiny, every affirmative action plan that\npursues some purpose other than correcting a manifest imbalance\nor remedying past discrimination will run afoul of Title VII.\nIndeed, the Court in Weber explicitly cautioned that its holding\nin that case should not be read to define the outer boundaries of\nthe area of discretion left to employers by Title VII for the\nvoluntary adoption of affirmative action measures. The Court\nstated:\n         We need not today define in detail the line\n         of demarcation between permissible and\n         impermissible affirmative action plans. It\n         suffices to hold that the challenged Kaiser-\n\f         USWA affirmative action plan falls on the\n         permissible side of the line. The purposes\n         of the plan mirror those of the statute.\n         Both were designed to break down old patterns\n         of racial segregation and hierarchy. Both\n         were structured to \"open employment\n         opportunities for Negroes in occupations\n         which have been traditionally closed to\n         them.\"\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 208. See also id. at 215-16 (Blackmun, J.,\nconcurring)(noting that Kaiser plan \"is a moderate one\" and that\n\"the Court's opinion does not foreclose other forms of\naffirmative action\").\n         The majority opinion in Johnson made no attempt to draw\nthe line that Weber left undefined. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 642\n(Stevens, J., concurring) (\"I write . . . to . . . emphasize that\nthe opinion does not establish the permissible outer limits of\nvoluntary [affirmative action] programs\"). Although Justice\nO'Connor's concurring opinion argued that permissible purposes\nunder Title VII were limited to those that served to remedy past\ndiscrimination, Johnson 480 U.S. at 649, her vote was the sixth\nin favor of the majority's holding and therefore not crucial to\nthe outcome of the case. It follows that her narrow reading\nshould not be read as constituting the view of the Court. SeeMarks v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109611\"><a href=\"/opinion/109611/marks-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (1977).\n\n         The majority here has taken the language of Weber where\nthe Court observed that the plan's purposes \"mirrored\" those of\nthe statute, and has elevated it to a litmus test under which an\naffirmative action plan can only pass muster under Title VII if\nparticular language in the text or legislative history of the\nstatute can be identified that matches the articulated purpose of\nthe plan. Nothing in Weber suggests that the Court intended by\nits \"mirroring\" language to create such a rigid test.\n         In Weber, when the Court found that the purposes of the\nplan were consistent with those of Title VII, it did so by\nreference not only to the language of the legislative history,\nbut to the historical context from which the Act arose as well.\nId. at 201. In Johnson, the Court made no attempt at all to\nidentify language in the legislative history paralleling the\nparticular objectives of the plan it sustained. Thus, even in\nthose cases the Court did not demonstrate the kind of close fit\nbetween the plan and the statutory history demanded of the Board\nin this case.\n         In Weber, the Court's examination into the purposes of\nTitle VII led it to the conclusion that the Act was designed to\npromote \"the integration of blacks into the mainstream of\nAmerican society,\" Weber, 443 U.S. at 202, and the breakdown of\n\"old patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy,\" id. at 208.\nThe Kaiser affirmative action plan was consistent with these\nsweeping, broadly stated purposes and hence was sustained.\n         Of course, I do not disagree with the majority that\n\"Title VII was written to eradicate not only discrimination per\nse but the consequences of prior discrimination,\" but I do not\n\fbelieve that in doing so, Congress intended to limit the reach of\nTitle VII to remedying past discrimination, thereby turning a\nblind eye toward those social forces that give rise to future\ndiscrimination. Title VII, which was a part of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1964, was fundamentally forward-looking legislation, and\nthat purpose should not be ignored.\n         The effort to remedy the consequences of past\ndiscrimination (such as the \"patterns of segregation and\nhierarchy\" referred to in Weber, 443 U.S. at 208), cannot be\nisolated from the statute's broader aim to eliminate those\npatterns that were potential causes of continuing or future\ndiscrimination. The causal relationship is illustrated by the\nindustry at issue in Weber, where the Court noted that the\nongoing imbalance in the hiring of craftworkers had its roots in\na history of discrimination that had excluded Blacks from craft\nunions and thus prevented them from acquiring the necessary\nqualifications. Id. at 198. In describing the overarching goal\ntoward which the Civil Rights Act was aimed, the House Report\nspoke of the need to \"eliminat[e] all of the causes and\nconsequences of racial and other types of discrimination against\nminorities.\" H.R. Rep. No. 914, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at\n18 (1963), reprinted in 1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2391, 2393 (emphasis\nadded).\n         Thus, using the approach taken in Weber and Johnson as\na springboard, actions consistent with and in furtherance of the\nbroad statutory goal of eliminating the causes of discrimination\nare not per se proscribed by Title VII. This generation of young\npeople may not recall that in 1964 racial homogeneity in schools\nwas viewed as among the most fundamental and pernicious aspects\nof the social pattern undergirding the system of discrimination\nthat the Civil Rights Act sought to dismantle. In the years\nleading up to the Act's passage, school integration was one of\nthe focal points of the civil rights movement. The Senate Report\naccompanying the 1972 amendments to Title VII, when it was\nexpanded to cover state and local governments, noted the\nconnection between racial homogeneity in schools and attitudes\nthat lead to discrimination:\n              It is difficult to imagine a more\n              sensitive area than educational\n              institutions where the youth of the\n              Nation are exposed to a multitude of\n              ideas and impressions that will strongly\n              influence their future development. To\n              permit discrimination here [among\n              faculty and staff] would, more than in\n              any other area, tend to promote existing\n              misconceptions and stereotypical\n              categorizations which in turn would lead\n              to future patterns of discrimination.\nS. Rep. No. 415, 92nd Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1971)).\n         In other contexts, the Court has repeatedly recognized\nracial diversity in the classroom as an important means of\ncombatting the attitudes that can lead to future patterns of\ndiscrimination. As Justice Stevens observed in Wygant:\n\f         In the context of public education, it is\n         quite obvious that a school board may\n         reasonably conclude that an integrated\n         faculty will be able to provide benefits to\n         the student body that could not be provided\n         by an all-white, or nearly all-white,\n         faculty. For one of the most important\n         lessons that the American public schools\n         teach is that the diverse ethnic, cultural\n         and national backgrounds that have been\n         brought together in our famous \"melting pot\"\n         do not identify essential differences among\n         the human beings that inhabit our land. It\n         is one thing for a white child to be taught\n         by a white teacher that color, like beauty,\n         is only \"skin deep\"; it is far more\n         convincing to experience that truth on a day-\n         to-day basis during the routine ongoing\n         learning process.\n476 U.S. at 315 (Stevens, J., dissenting).

Nor\ndoes it seem plausible that the drafters of Title VII intended it\nto be interpreted so as to require a local school district to\nresort to a lottery to determine which of two qualified teachers\nto retain, rather than employ the School Board's own educational\npolicy undertaken to insure students an opportunity to learn from\na teacher who was a member of the very group whose treatment\n\fmotivated Congress to enact Title VII in the first place. In my\nview, the Board's purpose of obtaining the educational benefit to\nbe derived from a racially diverse faculty is entirely consistent\nwith the purposes animating Title VII and the Civil Rights Act of\n1964.\n         The majority criticizes the Board's use of caselaw\nconstruing the Equal Protection Clause in this Title VII case,\nnotwithstanding the Supreme Court's explicit statement in Johnsonthat\nTitle VII's constraint on affirmative action was \"not\nintended to extend as far as that of the Constitution.\" 480 U.S.\nat 628 n.6. Nothing in the Court's language in the Johnsonfootnote\nsuggests that we confine it to the particular factual\ncontext in which it was made, and the Court is certainly\nsufficiently articulate to limit its language when so inclined.\nNor is the Johnson footnote the only place where the Court\nsignified its understanding that Title VII imposes fewer\nlimitations on employers' voluntary affirmative action than does\nthe Constitution. In Weber, the Court spoke of the \"narrowness\nof [its] inquiry\" since the plan did not involve state action and\nhence did not present an alleged violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause, Weber, 443 U.S. at 200, and later stated that\n\"Title VII . . . was not intended to incorporate and\nparticularize the commands of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments.\" Id. at 206 n.6 (quoted in Johnson, 480 U.S. at 627\nn.6). The latter statement was not made in a discussion that had\nto do with the \"factual predicate\" for demonstrating the need for\nremedial affirmative action, as the majority would confine the\nsimilar language in Johnson.\n         In any event, ultimately it is the Supreme Court rather\nthan this one that will decide whether Title VII allows an\nemployer more discretion to implement race-conscious employment\npolicies than does the Constitution in the employer's effort to\npromote the underlying goals of the Act. But, in the absence of\nany dispositive precedent, I believe it would be shortsighted for\nus to disregard the Supreme Court's statements regarding the\nadvantages of diversity in an educational context when examining\nthe limited use to which diversity was used as a factor in the\nBoard's decision here.

I\nwould hold that a school board's bona fide decision to obtain the\neducational benefit to be derived from a racially diverse faculty\nis a permissible basis for its voluntary affirmative action under\nTitle VII scrutiny.\n                               III.\n         It is undeniable that, in the abstract, a layoff\nimposes a far greater burden on the affected employee than a\ndenial of promotion or even a failure to hire. In this case,\nhowever, it cannot be said with any certainty that Taxman would\n\fhave avoided the layoff had the Board's decision not been race-\nconscious. If a random selection had been made, Taxman would\nhave had no more than a fifty-percent chance of not being laid\noff.

Moreover, just as the plaintiff in Johnson remained\neligible for promotion in the future, 480 U.S. at 638, Taxman\nretained recall rights after her layoff, and did in fact regain\nher job.\n         The majority relies in part on Wygant, where the\nSupreme Court found that the use of faculty layoffs to meet\naffirmative action goals in a public school system imposed too\nheavy a burden on White employees. Wygant, 476 U.S. at 282-83.\nHowever, the Court's holding that the Wygant plan was not\n\"narrowly tailored\" for purposes of an equal protection challenge\nis not dispositive of the present inquiry as to whether a plan\n\"unnecessarily trammels\" the rights of White employees for Title\nVII purposes. Not only was a different legal standard applicable\nbut Wygant is also distinguishable because the Wygant plan caused\nnonminority teachers with more seniority to be laid off in order\nto retain minority teachers with less seniority. Wygant, 476\nU.S. at 282. The Wygant plan actually caused teachers to be laid\noff who, in the absence of the plan, would have had no risk of\nlayoff. That burden -- increasing the chance of layoff from zero\nto one hundred percent -- is significantly heavier than that\nimposed on Taxman, who would have had a substantial chance of\nbeing laid off even absent any consideration of diversity.\n         Only three members of the Court subscribed to language\nin the plurality opinion in Wygant suggesting that the use of\nlayoffs to accomplish affirmative action goals will never survive\nstrict scrutiny. See 476 U.S. at 284. The two concurring\njustices did not go that far. See id. at 293 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (\"[n]or is it necessary, in my view, to resolve the\ntroubling question[] whether any layoff provision could survive\nstrict scrutiny\"); id. at 295 (White, J., concurring) (confining\nhis conclusion to the specifics of the layoff policy at issue).\n\fTherefore I do not read Wygant to hold that no race-conscious\nlayoff decision will survive Title VII scrutiny.\n         The majority gives a similarly narrow reading to Weberand\nJohnson, construing these cases to impose a wooden,\n\"unequivocal\" requirement that all affirmative action plans must\nbe explicitly temporary in order to be valid. Majority\nTypescript at 40. In fact, the Johnson plan itself \"contain[ed]\nno explicit end date,\" Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639, and the Court\nindicated that only certain plans that are particularly\nburdensome on nonminorities in other respects need necessarily be\nexpressly temporary. \"Express assurance that a program is only\ntemporary may be necessary if the program actually sets aside\npositions according to specific numbers.\" Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n639-40 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court's references to the\ntemporary duration of the plans at issue in Weber and Johnson are\nmore accurately construed as an understandable effort to assure\nthat race does not become a permanently embedded consideration in\nemployment decisions. The significant consideration is whether\nthere has been an effort \"to minimize the effect of the program\non other employees,\" not whether the underlying policy is set to\nrun a specified number of years. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 640.\n          In the situation before us, I see ample basis from\nwhich to deduce an effort to minimize the effect of the Board's\naffirmative action policy on non-minority employees. One such\naspect is the discretionary nature of the policy. The Board is\nfree not to apply the policy, even to break a tie. Also\nsignificant is the infrequency with which the Board has resorted\nto the policy. Although it may be of little comfort to Taxman,\nthe fact that this is the first time in the twenty years since\nthe policy was adopted that it has been applied to a layoff\ndecision demonstrates the minimum impact on White teachers as a\nwhole. And since, by its own terms, it only applies in the rare\ninstances in which two candidates are of different races but\nequal qualifications and the department in question is not\nalready diverse, it is likely that it will continue to be\ninfrequently applied. See District Court's Final Judgment and\nContingent Order, entered February 15, 1994 at 2 (denying request\nfor broad injunction because \"[t]here is, in the court's view, no\nlikelihood that the conduct at issue in this case will recur\").\n         In this connection, I deem it further evidence of the\nBoard's interest in minimizing any adverse effect on non-\nminorities that it has not defined diversity by any specific\nnumerical goal. Although the majority regards that as a major\nconcern, I view the lack of any such figure as an indication that\nthe Board's plan does not impose a fixed quota with the rigidity\nattendant thereto.\n         It is not the province of this court to intrude into\nwhat is essentially an educational decision. Once we have\ndetermined that promoting faculty diversity for educational\npurposes can be a valid justification for an appropriately\nlimited race-conscious action, it is not our role to second-guess\nthe judgment of educators as to the level of diversity that\nproduces the educational environment they deem appropriate.\nThe Board's action is an attempt to create an educational\n\fenvironment that will maximize the ability of students to address\nracial stereotypes and misconceptions born of lack of\nfamiliarity. I find it difficult to believe that an Act that was\ngiven birth by the tensions of the civil rights era precludes it\nfrom doing so under the facts before us here. Given the record\nbefore us, the consequence of the narrow reading that the\nmajority gives Weber and Johnson is the very irony that the\nSupreme Court said would result from interpreting this civil\nrights statute in a manner divorced from its historic context.\nAs the Court noted in Weber:\n         [i]t would be ironic indeed if a law triggered by a\n         Nation's concern over centuries of racial injustice and\n         intended to improve the lot of those who had \"been\n         excluded from the American dream for so long,\" 110\n         Cong. Rec. 6552 (1964) (remarks of Sen. Humphrey),\n         constituted the first legislative prohibition of all\n         voluntary, private, race-conscious efforts to abolish\n         traditional patterns of racial segregation and\n         hierarchy.\n\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 204.\n         I return to the question raised at the outset: whether\nTitle VII requires that the Board toss a coin to make the layoff\nselection between equally situated employees. In his opinion for\nthe majority in Weber, Justice Brennan noted the distinction made\nby Congress between requiring and permitting affirmative action\nby employers. See Weber, 443 U.S. at 205-06. He deemed it\nimportant that, while Congress explicitly provided that Title VII\nshould not be interpreted to require any employer to grant\npreferential treatment to a group because of its race, Congress\nnever stated that Title VII should not be interpreted to permitcertain\nvoluntary efforts.\n         In this case, the majority gives too little\nconsideration to the tie-breaking method that its holding will\nimpose on the Board. It points to no language in Title VII to\nsuggest that a lottery is required as the solution to a layoff\ndecision in preference to a reasoned decision by members of the\nSchool Board, some of whom are experienced educators, that race\nof a faculty member has a relevant educational significance if\nthe department would otherwise be all White. While it may seem\nfairer to some, I see nothing in Title VII that requires use of a\nlottery.\n         Because I cannot say that faculty diversity is not a\npermissible purpose to support the race conscious decision made\nhere and because the Board's action was not overly intrusive on\nTaxman's rights, I would reverse the grant of summary judgment\nfor Taxman under Title VII and direct that summary judgment be\ngranted to the School Board.\nTaxman v.

When added to a university's high academic\nstandards, this exposure constitutes a formidable educational\nexperience.\n         In this case, the Piscataway Board of Education\nconcluded that a diverse faculty also serves a compelling\neducational purpose; namely, it benefits students in the business\ndepartment by exposing them to teachers with varied backgrounds.\nThe Board implemented a program that, in limited circumstances,\nallows consideration of race as a factor in school employment\ndecisions. The Board did not countenance the layoff of a more-\nqualified teacher in the place of a less-qualified one. It did\nnot prefer teachers junior in seniority to those with more\nexperience. Rather it concluded that when teachers are equal in\nability and in all other respects--and only then--diversity of\nthe faculty is a relevant consideration.\n         I do not believe Title VII prevents a school district,\nin the exercise of its professional judgment, from preferring one\nequally qualified teacher over another for a valid educational\npurpose.\n         Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nUnited States v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of Piscataway\nSharon Taxman v. Bd. of Educ. of the Twp. of Piscataway\nNos. 94-5090 and 94-5112\n\n\nLEWIS, Circuit Judge, with whom Judge McKee joins, dissenting.\n         I join in Chief Judge Sloviter's dissent, as well as\nthose of each of my dissenting colleagues.\n         I would only add that we should be mindful of the\neffects the majority's approach will impose upon legitimate,\nthoughtful efforts to redress the vestiges of our Nation's\nhistory of discrimination in the workplace and in education;\nefforts which, in seeking to achieve pluralism and diversity,\nhave helped define and enrich our offices and institutions, and\nwhich were intended to open, and keep open, the doors of\nopportunity to those who have \"been excluded from the American\ndream for so long.\" See 110 Cong. Rec. 6552 (1964) (excerpted\nfrom Sen. Humphrey's remarks). This, after all, is what I had\nalways thought Title VII was intended to accomplish. More\nimportantly, as Chief Judge Sloviter notes, these goals are\n\fplainly supported by the statute's legislative history. Thus,\nwhile the majority holds that Title VII only allows race to be\nconsidered in remedying a history of intentional discrimination\nor a \"manifest imbalance,\" I believe this conclusion is\nfundamentally at odds with the overriding goals of the statute.\nAnd the real-life impact of the majority's unprecedented\nconstruction of Title VII is readily apparent when one\ncontemplates the myriad of difficult decisions that employers\nacross the nation face everyday.\n         Somewhere out there in the real world, for example,\nthere is a law firm with a racial make-up (a workforce) akin to\nPiscataway High School's; a firm which lacks a history of\nintentional discrimination in hiring but, due to economic\nconcerns, must decide between retaining one of two attorneys --\nthe first and only black associate to work in its prestigious\nanti-trust department, or his equally qualified white\ncounterpart. The firm's management committee may decide that to\nlay-off the black associate would be an unwise and potentially\ndamaging business decision because it would negate the large\ninvestment of time, effort and money spent trying to recruit and\nretain minority lawyers. In other words, the firm may believe\nthat diversity would be good for business and good for itself,\nso, everything else being equal, it decides to lay-off the white\nassociate.\n         In a situation such as this, the firm's reliance upon\nrace as one among many factors in making its decision is the type\nof management prerogative which is totally consistent with the\ngoals and underlying purpose behind Title VII. See Weber, 443\nU.S. at 206 (noting that Title VII's legislative history\ndemonstrates that the statute was not intended to place\nunnecessary limits upon \"management prerogatives\"). After it\nreads the majority's decision, however, it seems clear that the\nfirm will be forced to disregard its own better business\njudgment, forsake its recent recruiting successes among\nminorities and, I suppose, flip a coin on its own future as well\nas the young associates', all in order to avoid the specter of\nTitle VII liability and an enormous damage award.\n         At times, a private college, with a handful of\nminorities on its faculty and with no history of intentional\ndiscrimination in hiring, is faced with the unenviable task of\ndeciding which of two young associate professors with\nindistinguishable records to grant tenure in a particular\ndepartment. The only difference between the two is that one is\nwhite and the other is Latino. After reviewing all of the other\nfactors and finding them in equipoise, the tenure committee may\ndecide to offer the position to the Latino associate professor\nbecause there has never been a tenured Latino professor in any\ndepartment at the college, and because it believes his presence\nat the college will be a significant benefit to the entire\nstudent body. As with the law firm, this decision is entirely\nconsistent with Title VII because it is motivated by some of the\nsame concerns that lead Congress to enact the statute. SeeWeber, 443 U.S.\nat 208 (noting that the plan was valid under\nTitle VII in part because the \"purposes . . . mirror those of the\n\fstatute\").\n         But again, the majority's rationale will thwart the\ncollege's ability to rely upon its independent judgment in\ndeciding what is in the best interests of the students whom it is\ncharged with educating. Instead, according to the majority, that\nimportant judgment is better exercised (in this case may only be\nexercised) by resorting to a coin-flip.\n         One could cite countless other examples of the\nsignificant and ultimately counterproductive effects of the\nmajority's narrow construction of Title VII, but suffice it to\nsay that in my view, Title VII was not enacted to prevent the\nthoughtful, deliberative processes employed by such a law firm or\ncollege. I believe that in this case the school board's decision\nto consider race, among other factors, in an attempt to ensure a\ndiverse faculty for its students was in furtherance of Title\nVII's goal of breaking-down \"existing misconceptions and\nstereotypical categorizations which in turn lead to future\npatterns of discrimination.\" See S. Rep. No. 415, 92nd Cong.,\n1st Sess. 12 (1971). Accordingly, its decision was as legal as\nit was laudable.\n         I believe the majority's decision eviscerates the\npurpose and the goals of Title VII. I respectfully\ndissent.Taxman v. Board of Education of the Twp. of Piscataway\nNos. 94-5090 & 94-5112\n\nMcKEE, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom SLOVITER, Chief Judgeand\nLEWIS, Circuit Judge join.\n         I join each the opinions of my dissenting colleagues,\nbut write only to elaborate upon what I consider to be important\nconsiderations in our analysis. \"The prohibition against racial\ndiscrimination in §§ 703(a) and (d) of Title VII must [ ] be read\nagainst the background of the legislative history of Title VII\nand the historical context from which the Act arose.\" United\nSteelworkers v. Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (1979).\n         We have now come full circle. A law enacted by Congress\nin 1964 to move this country closer to an integrated society and\naway from the legacy of \"separate but equal\" is being interpreted\nas outlawing this Board of Education's good faith effort to teach\nstudents the value of diversity. The selection of Ms. Williams\nmeant that the business department would retain the only Black\nteacher tenured in that department in anyone's memory. Board\nPresident Theodore H. Kruse testified that it was his \"general\nfeeling . . . that it was valuable for the students to see in the\nvarious employment roles a wide range of background[s]\" and that\ndiversity \"was also valuable to the work force and in particular\nto the teaching staff.\" Da74. Kruse further explained that \"by\nretaining Mrs. Williams it was sending a very clear message that\nwe feel that our student population is culturally diverse and\nthere is a distinct advantage to students . . . to be made . . .\nmore aware, more tolerant, more accepting, more understanding of\npeople of all background[s].\" Da75. I can not believe that\nTitle VII was intended to strike down such an action.\n         As Chief Judge Sloviter points out, the majority's\nruling is based upon an interpretation of United Steelworkers v.\n\fWeber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110135\"><a href=\"/opinion/110135/steelworkers-v-weber/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979), and Johnson v.

See Typescript at 10-11 (Sloviter, C.J.,\ndissenting). The majority's conclusion that affirmative action\nplans not limited to attempts to remedy past discrimination run\nafoul of Title VII simply ignores the legislative history that\nWeber and Johnson require us to consider.\n                    Given the interpretation of [Title VII] the\n                    Court adopted in Weber, I see no reason why\n                    the employer has any duty, prior to granting\n                    a preference to a qualified minority\n                    employee, to determine whether his past\n                    conduct might constitute an arguable\n                    violation of Title VII. Indeed, in some\n                    instances the employer might find it more\n                    helpful to focus on the future. Instead of\n                    retroactively scrutinizing his own or\n                    society's possible exclusions of minorities\n                    in the past to determine the outer limits of\n                    a valid affirmative-action program -- or\n                    indeed, any particular affirmative-action\n                    decision -- in many cases the employer will\n                    find it more appropriate to consider other\n                    legitimate reasons to give preferences to\n                    members of under-represented groups.\n                    Statutes enacted for the benefit of minority\n                    groups should not block these forward-looking\n                    considerations.\n          480 U.S. at 646-47 (Stevens, J., concurring). This is\nparticularly true in the field of education where young people\nare developing opinions and beliefs that will determine their\nattitudes as citizens, and this country's future. Under such\ncircumstances, the School Board considered Ms. Williams' race as\na factor that was weighed in the balance with all other factors\nin making a very difficult choice between two equally fine\nteachers.\n         Similar consideration of an employee's sex has been\nupheld in Johnson. There, the Court stated:\n                    We therefore hold that the Agency\n                    appropriately took into account as one factor\n                    the sex of [the employee] in determining that\n                    she should be promoted to the road dispatcher\n                    position. The decision to do so was made\n                    pursuant to an affirmative action plan that\n                    represents a moderate, flexible, case-by-case\n                    approach to effecting a gradual improvement\n                    in the representation of minorities and women\n                    in the Agency's work force. Such a plan is\n                    fully consistent with Title VII, for it\n                    embodies the contribution that voluntary\n                    employer action can make in eliminating the\n                    vestiges of discrimination in the workplace.\n\n          480 U.S. at 641-42.   Thus, I disagree with the majority's\n\fconclusion that \"there is no congressional recognition of\ndiversity as a Title VII objective requiring accommodation.\"\nMaj. Op. at 24.\n         To be sure, I can understand the majority's concern\nover allowing race to be a factor in any decision. History\nloudly proclaims the evil that can spring from such practices,\nand it is sometimes all too easy to simply ignore that evil when\nthe practice appears to be driven by a benign purpose. However,\nI do not believe that what the Board of Education was attempting\nto do here, nor the individualized manner in which it was\nattempting to do it, runs afoul of a Congressional enactment\ncloaked in the legislative history recounted herein, and in the\nopinions of my colleagues.\n         Not that long ago the President's Commission on Civil\nDisorders (the \"Kerner Commission\") warned that \"[o]ur nation is\nmoving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and\nunequal.\" Report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders,\nat\n1 (March 1, 1968). Some may view the Board's efforts here as yet\nanother push in that direction. Indeed, if we were writing upon a\nclean slate that would no doubt be true. But of course, we do\nnot do that. The shadows and images that moved Congress to enact\nTitle VII in 1964 are already etched into our slate, and they\ndefine the reality that should guide our analysis. The Board has\nresponded to those shadows with an action that is a narrow,\nindividualized and reasoned attempt to foster respect for\ndiversity. Because that is consistent with the purposes of Title\nVII, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
