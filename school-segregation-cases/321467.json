For the reasons set forth below, we will\n\nsummarily affirm.1\n\n                                             I.\n\n       Sharob Abdul-Aziz, a New Jersey prisoner, filed an amended complaint pursuant\n\nto 42 U.S.C. § 1983, naming as defendants various officials and employees of the New\n\nJersey State Prison (“NJSP”). The complaint alleged that Muslim inmates were\n\nprevented from practicing their religion, and that Abdul-Aziz was retaliated against for\n\ntrying to rectify the unfair treatment. The alleged retaliation involved a nine-day\n\nassignment to temporary close custody (“TCC”) and transfer to an institutional job that\n\nwas much lower-paying than his previous position. According to Abdul-Aziz, these\n\nactions violated his rights under the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment. He asked\n\nfor monetary and injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We may\nsummarily affirm a decision of the District Court if the appeal does not raise a substantial\nissue. 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We may affirm on any basis supported by the\nrecord. Murray v. Bledsoe, 650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir. 2011) (per curiam). Because\nAbdul-Aziz is proceeding in forma pauperis, we must dismiss the appeal if it is frivolous.\n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).\n\n                                             2\n\f       The District Court dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) Abdul-\n\nAziz’s claims that his job reassignment violated his rights under the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment and that his time in the TCC violated his rights under the\n\nDue Process Clause and Eighth Amendment, and denied his request for injunctive relief\n\nregarding the return of his musical instruments and electronic equipment. The District\n\nCourt also denied Abdul-Aziz’s motion to certify a class of Muslim inmates at NJSP.2\n\nFollowing discovery, Abdul-Aziz and the defendants made cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, which the District Court denied with respect to Abdul-Aziz and granted in part\n\nand denied in part with respect to the defendants, leaving one claim viable. Counsel was\n\nappointed to represent Abdul-Aziz, and after additional discovery, the defendants again\n\nmoved for summary judgment. The District Court granted the defendants’ motion, and\n\nAbdul-Aziz timely appealed.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s dismissal order. See Allah v.\n\nSeiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir. 2000). Dismissal is appropriate where the pleader\n\nhas not alleged “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is\n\n\n\n2\n We agree with the District Court’s reasons for denying these motions and will not\naddress them further.\nWe review such an action for abuse of discretion, Brown v. City of Pittsburgh, 586 F.3d\n263, 268 (3d Cir. 2009), and discern no error in the District Court’s denial of Abdul-\nAziz’s motions for a preliminary injunction. The motion requested relief that was\nduplicative of that requested by the complaint. Because Abdul-Aziz’s complaint was not\nsupported by adequate evidence, he is not entitled to the relief requested.\n                                               3\n\fplausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n       Upon review, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Abdul-\n\nAziz’s claim that conditions during his time in TCC violated his rights under the Eighth\n\nAmendment. To establish that one’s conditions of confinement violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, a plaintiff must show he was\n\ndenied “the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.” Betts v. New Castle Youth\n\nDev. Ctr., 621 F.3d 249, 256 (3d Cir. 2010). Although Abdul-Aziz alleged that he was\n\nnot given a change of clothing, he did not claim that he was forced to go without clothing\n\nor that his fundamental needs were not being met. This Court held, in Gibson v. Lynch,\n\n652 F.2d 348 (3d Cir. 1981), that an inmate’s incarceration for 90 days in solitary\n\nconfinement due to prison overcrowding did not violate the Eighth Amendment where his\n\nbasic needs for nutrition and shelter were being met. Id. at 350, 352. As Abdul-Aziz was\n\nin TCC for only nine days, dismissal for failure to state a claim was appropriate.\n\n       Furthermore, we agree with the District Court that Abdul-Aziz failed to state a\n\nclaim for violation of his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment following\n\nhis transfer to TCC. It is well-settled that placement in administrative confinement will\n\ngenerally not create a liberty interest. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995); Allah\n\nv. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 224 (3d Cir. 2000). Rather, a “liberty interest only exists if\n\nthat placement is an ‘atypical and significant hardship’ relative to others similarly\n\nsentenced.” Leamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 546 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting Sandin, 515\n                                              4\n\fU.S. at 484). We have previously held that seven months in disciplinary confinement did\n\nnot implicate a liberty interest. Smith v. Mensinger, 293 F.3d 641, 645, 654 (3d Cir.\n\n2002). Similarly, disciplinary detention for fifteen days and administrative segregation\n\nfor 120 days did not implicate a protected liberty interest. Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d\n\n141, 151-52 (3d Cir. 2002); cf. Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 144 (3d Cir. 2000) (holding\n\nthat eight years in administrative custody is atypical and implicates a protected liberty\n\ninterest). Here, Abdul-Aziz complained of a due process violation based on nine days in\n\nTCC. The conditions he complained of reflect typical restrictions in administrative\n\ncustody. We conclude that the duration and conditions of Abdul-Aziz’s segregation\n\ncannot be deemed atypical. Accordingly, he does not have a protected liberty interest and\n\nwas not entitled to procedural due process protection.\n\n       Similarly, we agree with the District Court that Abdul-Aziz did not have a\n\nprotected liberty interest in the institutional job he lost, and that he accordingly failed to\n\nstate a viable Fourteenth Amendment claim arising from that occurrence. Inmates do not\n\nhave a liberty or property interest in their job assignments that would give rise to Due\n\nProcess Clause protection. James v. Quinlan, 866 F.2d 627, 629-630 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n                                              III.\n\n       The remainder of Abdul-Aziz’s claims were terminated pursuant to the\n\ndefendants’ motions for summary judgment. We review the District Court’s orders\n\ngranting summary judgment de novo and review the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party. Burns v. Pa. Dep’t of Corr., 642 F.3d 163, 170 (3d Cir. 2011). A\n                                               5\n\fgrant of summary judgment will be affirmed if our review reveals that “there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter\n\nof law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n       Abdul-Aziz claimed that his right to practice his religion was infringed upon by\n\nNJSP’s refusal to accept donated Halal meats for use in the inmates’ meals, by providing\n\n“vegetarian” meals that were not actually vegetarian, and by prohibiting inmates from\n\npossessing prayer oil in their cells. He alleged that Jewish inmates were provided Kosher\n\nmeals for Passover, and Muslim inmates were therefore denied equal protection of the\n\nlaw. He claimed that these policies and practices violated his rights pursuant to the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n       “Inmates clearly retain protections afforded by the First Amendment, including its\n\ndirective that no law shall prohibit the free exercise of religion.” O’Lone v. Estate of\n\nShabazz, 482 U.S. 342, 348 (1987) (citation omitted). However, an inmate only “retains\n\nthose First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or\n\nwith the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.” Pell v. Procunier,\n\n417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974). To determine whether a regulation infringing upon\n\nconstitutional rights is reasonable, courts apply the four factors set forth in Turner v.\n\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987). These factors require courts to consider: (1) whether the\n\nregulation bears a ‘valid, rational connection’ to a legitimate and neutral government\n\nobjective; (2) “whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain\n\nopen to prison inmates;” (3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\n                                              6\n\fright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources\n\ngenerally;” and (4) “the absence of ready alternatives.” Id. at 89-90; see also Fraise v.\n\nTerhune, 283 F.3d 506, 513-14 (3d Cir. 2002) (citations omitted).\n\n       With regard to Abdul-Aziz’s Equal Protection claim, “Turner is equally applicable\n\n[], and the appropriate analysis for this claim is the same as that for [his] Free Exercise\n\nclaim.” DeHart v. Horn, 227 F.3d 47, 61 (3d Cir. 2000). Generally, prison officials\n\ncannot discriminate against inmates of different religions. Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319\n\n(1972) (per curiam). However, an inmate “cannot obtain relief if the difference between\n\nthe defendants’ treatment of him and their treatment of [inmates of another religion] is\n\n‘reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.’” DeHart, 227 F.3d at 61.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that no genuine issue of material fact\n\nexisted in Abdul-Aziz’s claim that NJSP’s policy regarding Halal meats placed a\n\nburden on his religious exercise. Abdul-Aziz claimed that there were donations of\n\nHalal meat available for Muslim feast days that the prison refused to accept, but\n\nnothing in the record suggests that the consumption of meat, Halal or otherwise, is\n\nrequired for Abdul-Aziz to practice his religion. In his deposition, Abdul-Aziz\n\ndescribes Halal food as “pork-free, wine-free, [and] slaughtered properly . . . .\n\nevery day this would be your diet.” Dkt. No. 43-6, at 59. Vegetarian meals satisfy\n\nthese requirements. Review of the record indicates that NJSP cannot accept\n\ndonated meals unless such food is determined to be necessary for the observance\n\nof a holy day. Id. at 9. Abdul-Aziz has presented evidence establishing only that\n                                              7\n\fany meat eaten by Muslims must be Halal, not that Halal meats must be eaten on\n\nfeast days. Therefore his First Amendment rights were not violated, nor were his\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights. Jewish inmates received Kosher meals at Passover\n\nbecause they were determined to be necessary for religious observance. Id.\n\nBecause the vegetarian meals did not violate Islam’s proscription on non-Halal\n\nmeat, while non-Kosher meals would not have met the religious requirements of\n\nPassover, reasonable penological interests were served by the differential\n\ntreatment.\n\n       The District Court also correctly determined that no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact existed with respect to Abdul-Aziz’s claim that the vegetarian meals\n\nserved at NJSP actually contained meat. Abdul-Aziz cited a transcript from a\n\ndeposition taken in 2001 and a letter from Schreiber Foods stating that trace\n\namount of certain enzymes could be present in School Choice American cheese.\n\nDkt. No. 39-2, at 37-39. Review of the record in this case indicates that the\n\nreligious vegetarian meals at NJSP are not contaminated. The DOC Regional\n\nFood Service Supervisor specified that the religious vegetarian meals at NJSP do\n\nnot contain meat or American cheese. He also indicated that the meals contain\n\npowder cheddar cheese that is not made with meat. Dkt. No. 43-5, at 2. As\n\nAbdul-Aziz offered no evidence contrary to this declaration, the grant of summary\n\njudgment was proper.\n\n\n                                             8\n\f         The final aspect of Abdul-Aziz’s religious claim is that his religious\n\nexercise was impeded by NJSP’s policy forbidding the possession of oils in cells.\n\nNJSP forbids oils (including prayer oils) in cells for security reasons. Dkt. No. 43-\n\n3, at 3. Imam Rasoul Suluki, who is permitted to bring such oil into the prison for\n\nprayer services, stated in his declaration that while prayer oil is a “custom or\n\nrecommended practices,” it “is not part of the Islamic Fard, which is an obligatory\n\nor mandatory practice.” Dkt. no. 43-4, at 2. Review of the record did not produce\n\nany evidence suggesting that Abdul-Aziz’s ability to practice his faith was\n\nrestricted or that he was prohibited from practicing his religion in any manner.\n\nThe defendants were therefore entitled to an entry of summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n         Summary judgment in favor of the defendants was also proper as to Abdul-Aziz’s\n\nclaim of that the defendants retaliated against him by placing him in TCC and reassigning\n\nhim to a lower-paying institutional job. Retaliating against a prisoner for the exercise of\n\nhis constitutional rights is unconstitutional. See Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333–34\n\n(3d Cir. 2001). A plaintiff in a retaliation case must prove that: (1) he engaged in\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct, (2) “he suffered some ‘adverse action’ at the hands of\n\nthe prison officials”; and (3) “his constitutionally protected conduct was ‘a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor’ in the decision” to take that action. Id. at 333. “Prison officials may\n\nstill prevail by proving that they would have made the same decision absent the protected\n\nconduct for reasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.” Id. at 334.\n                                               9\n\f         Abdul-Aziz filed grievances regarding various matters from March until August\n\n2008. Dkt. No. 5, at 4-6. On August 15, 2008, prison officials discovered memory cards\n\nrolled up in Muslim prayer rugs in a common area of the prison. The memory cards were\n\nconfiscated as contraband. On August 18, 2008, Abdul-Aziz told prison officials that the\n\nmemory cards belonged to him. On August 19, 2008, Abdul-Aziz was transferred to\n\nTCC status. Dkt. No. 43-1, at 29. The defendants argued in their brief that “Plaintiff\n\nwould have been placed in TCC, issued the same disciplinary charge, and treated in the\n\nsame manner even in the absence of his filing grievances and/or complaints.” Id. at 28.\n\nThis statement, along with the chronology following the memory cards’ discovery,\n\nestablished a legitimate penological purpose for TCC status, thus precluding the existence\n\nof a genuine issue of material fact and entitling the defendants summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n         Likewise, nothing in the record indicates that Abdul-Aziz’s reassignment to a\n\nlower-paying institutional job was the result of retaliation, as it was also done for a\n\nlegitimate penological purpose. Abdul-Aziz was working as a Forms Room file clerk on\n\nJanuary 29, 2009, when an NJSP official observed speakers connected to Abdul-Aziz’s\n\nworkstation computer. Music files were stored on the computer, and Abdul-Aziz had\n\nlistened them on at least one occasion. Dkt. No. 82-1, at ¶¶ 32-33. Inmates are not\n\npermitted to download music or games on the computers. As a result, Abdul-Aziz was\n\ncharged with a disciplinary infraction for misuse of electronic equipment, but it was\n\ndismissed because he was not served with the charge within the applicable time limit. Id.\n                                              10\n\fat ¶ 50. However, following the disposition of any infraction, all inmates must go before\n\nthe Institutional Classification Committee (“ICC”), which may look at the conduct\n\nunderlying the charge regardless of its outcome. Id. at ¶¶ 40-41. The ICC has the\n\ndiscretion to reassign an inmate to a different job if it determines that the safety and\n\nsecurity of the facility will be threatened by returning the inmate to the inmate’s former\n\nwork assignment. Id. at ¶ 43. Abdul-Aziz met with the ICC on February 11, 2009, and\n\nhe was subsequently reassigned from Forms Room clerk to cell sanitation. Id. at ¶ 19.\n\nThis reassignment took place nearly three months after he filed a lawsuit and nearly five\n\nmonths after he filed his last complaint. Abdul-Aziz admitted all of the facts mentioned\n\nabove in his counter-statement of facts (Dkt. No. 84-2), and therefore there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether his reassignment served a legitimate penological\n\ninterest. Summary judgment in favor of defendants was therefore appropriate regarding\n\nthis claim as well.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily\n\naffirm.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n  To the extent Abdul-Aziz requests appointment of counsel in his argument in support of\nthe appeal, that request is denied.\n                                              11\n\f",

The complaint alleged that Muslim inmates were\n\nprevented from practicing their religion, and that Abdul-Aziz was retaliated against for\n\ntrying to rectify the unfair treatment. The alleged retaliation involved a nine-day\n\nassignment to temporary close custody (“TCC”) and transfer to an institutional job that\n\nwas much lower-paying than his previous position. According to Abdul-Aziz, these\n\nactions violated his rights under the First, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment. He asked\n\nfor monetary and injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

Because\nAbdul-Aziz is proceeding in forma pauperis, we must dismiss the appeal if it is frivolous.\n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).\n\n                                             2\n\f       The District Court dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) Abdul-\n\nAziz’s claims that his job reassignment violated his rights under the Due Process Clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment and that his time in the TCC violated his rights under the\n\nDue Process Clause and Eighth Amendment, and denied his request for injunctive relief\n\nregarding the return of his musical instruments and electronic equipment. The District\n\nCourt also denied Abdul-Aziz’s motion to certify a class of Muslim inmates at NJSP.2\n\nFollowing discovery, Abdul-Aziz and the defendants made cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, which the District Court denied with respect to Abdul-Aziz and granted in part\n\nand denied in part with respect to the defendants, leaving one claim viable.

To establish that one’s conditions of confinement violate the Eighth\n\nAmendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, a plaintiff must show he was\n\ndenied “the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.” Betts v.

Although Abdul-Aziz alleged that he was\n\nnot given a change of clothing, he did not claim that he was forced to go without clothing\n\nor that his fundamental needs were not being met. This Court held, in Gibson v. Lynch,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391851\"><a href=\"/opinion/391851/frazier-m-gibson-jr-59065-v-thomas-lynch-superintendent-youth/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1981), that an inmate’s incarceration for 90 days in solitary\n\nconfinement due to prison overcrowding did not violate the Eighth Amendment where his\n\nbasic needs for nutrition and shelter were being met. Id. at 350, 352. As Abdul-Aziz was\n\nin TCC for only nine days, dismissal for failure to state a claim was appropriate.\n\n       Furthermore, we agree with the District Court that Abdul-Aziz failed to state a\n\nclaim for violation of his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment following\n\nhis transfer to TCC. It is well-settled that placement in administrative confinement will\n\ngenerally not create a liberty interest. Sandin v.

Here, Abdul-Aziz complained of a due process violation based on nine days in\n\nTCC. The conditions he complained of reflect typical restrictions in administrative\n\ncustody. We conclude that the duration and conditions of Abdul-Aziz’s segregation\n\ncannot be deemed atypical. Accordingly, he does not have a protected liberty interest and\n\nwas not entitled to procedural due process protection.\n\n       Similarly, we agree with the District Court that Abdul-Aziz did not have a\n\nprotected liberty interest in the institutional job he lost, and that he accordingly failed to\n\nstate a viable Fourteenth Amendment claim arising from that occurrence. Inmates do not\n\nhave a liberty or property interest in their job assignments that would give rise to Due\n\nProcess Clause protection. James v.

R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n\n       Abdul-Aziz claimed that his right to practice his religion was infringed upon by\n\nNJSP’s refusal to accept donated Halal meats for use in the inmates’ meals, by providing\n\n“vegetarian” meals that were not actually vegetarian, and by prohibiting inmates from\n\npossessing prayer oil in their cells. He alleged that Jewish inmates were provided Kosher\n\nmeals for Passover, and Muslim inmates were therefore denied equal protection of the\n\nlaw. He claimed that these policies and practices violated his rights pursuant to the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n       “Inmates clearly retain protections afforded by the First Amendment, including its\n\ndirective that no law shall prohibit the free exercise of religion.” O’Lone v.

These factors require courts to consider: (1) whether the\n\nregulation bears a ‘valid, rational connection’ to a legitimate and neutral government\n\nobjective; (2) “whether there are alternative means of exercising the right that remain\n\nopen to prison inmates;” (3) “the impact accommodation of the asserted constitutional\n                                              6\n\fright will have on guards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources\n\ngenerally;” and (4) “the absence of ready alternatives.” Id. at 89-90; see also Fraise v.\n\nTerhune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776906\"><a href=\"/opinion/776906/jael-fraise-v-jack-terhune-commissioner-alexander-kettles-v-james-barbo/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513-14 (3d Cir. 2002) (citations omitted).\n\n       With regard to Abdul-Aziz’s Equal Protection claim, “Turner is equally applicable\n\n[], and the appropriate analysis for this claim is the same as that for [his] Free Exercise\n\nclaim.” DeHart v.

Generally, prison officials\n\ncannot discriminate against inmates of different religions. Cruz v. Beto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108484\"><a href=\"/opinion/108484/cruz-v-beto/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1972) (per curiam). However, an inmate “cannot obtain relief if the difference between\n\nthe defendants’ treatment of him and their treatment of [inmates of another religion] is\n\n‘reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.’” DeHart, 227 F.3d at 61.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that no genuine issue of material fact\n\nexisted in Abdul-Aziz’s claim that NJSP’s policy regarding Halal meats placed a\n\nburden on his religious exercise. Abdul-Aziz claimed that there were donations of\n\nHalal meat available for Muslim feast days that the prison refused to accept, but\n\nnothing in the record suggests that the consumption of meat, Halal or otherwise, is\n\nrequired for Abdul-Aziz to practice his religion. In his deposition, Abdul-Aziz\n\ndescribes Halal food as “pork-free, wine-free, [and] slaughtered properly . . . .\n\nevery day this would be your diet.” Dkt. No. 43-6, at 59. Vegetarian meals satisfy\n\nthese requirements. Review of the record indicates that NJSP cannot accept\n\ndonated meals unless such food is determined to be necessary for the observance\n\nof a holy day. Id. at 9. Abdul-Aziz has presented evidence establishing only that\n                                              7\n\fany meat eaten by Muslims must be Halal, not that Halal meats must be eaten on\n\nfeast days. Therefore his First Amendment rights were not violated, nor were his\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights. Jewish inmates received Kosher meals at Passover\n\nbecause they were determined to be necessary for religious observance. Id.\n\nBecause the vegetarian meals did not violate Islam’s proscription on non-Halal\n\nmeat, while non-Kosher meals would not have met the religious requirements of\n\nPassover, reasonable penological interests were served by the differential\n\ntreatment.\n\n       The District Court also correctly determined that no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact existed with respect to Abdul-Aziz’s claim that the vegetarian meals\n\nserved at NJSP actually contained meat. Abdul-Aziz cited a transcript from a\n\ndeposition taken in 2001 and a letter from Schreiber Foods stating that trace\n\namount of certain enzymes could be present in School Choice American cheese.\n\nDkt. No. 39-2, at 37-39. Review of the record in this case indicates that the\n\nreligious vegetarian meals at NJSP are not contaminated. The DOC Regional\n\nFood Service Supervisor specified that the religious vegetarian meals at NJSP do\n\nnot contain meat or American cheese. He also indicated that the meals contain\n\npowder cheddar cheese that is not made with meat. Dkt. No. 43-5, at 2. As\n\nAbdul-Aziz offered no evidence contrary to this declaration, the grant of summary\n\njudgment was proper.\n\n\n                                             8\n\f         The final aspect of Abdul-Aziz’s religious claim is that his religious\n\nexercise was impeded by NJSP’s policy forbidding the possession of oils in cells.\n\nNJSP forbids oils (including prayer oils) in cells for security reasons. Dkt. No. 43-\n\n3, at 3. Imam Rasoul Suluki, who is permitted to bring such oil into the prison for\n\nprayer services, stated in his declaration that while prayer oil is a “custom or\n\nrecommended practices,” it “is not part of the Islamic Fard, which is an obligatory\n\nor mandatory practice.” Dkt. no. 43-4, at 2. Review of the record did not produce\n\nany evidence suggesting that Abdul-Aziz’s ability to practice his faith was\n\nrestricted or that he was prohibited from practicing his religion in any manner.\n\nThe defendants were therefore entitled to an entry of summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n         Summary judgment in favor of the defendants was also proper as to Abdul-Aziz’s\n\nclaim of that the defendants retaliated against him by placing him in TCC and reassigning\n\nhim to a lower-paying institutional job. Retaliating against a prisoner for the exercise of\n\nhis constitutional rights is unconstitutional. See Rauser v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333–34\n\n(3d Cir. 2001). A plaintiff in a retaliation case must prove that: (1) he engaged in\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct, (2) “he suffered some ‘adverse action’ at the hands of\n\nthe prison officials”; and (3) “his constitutionally protected conduct was ‘a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor’ in the decision” to take that action. Id. at 333. “Prison officials may\n\nstill prevail by proving that they would have made the same decision absent the protected\n\nconduct for reasons reasonably related to a legitimate penological interest.” Id. at 334.\n                                               9\n\f         Abdul-Aziz filed grievances regarding various matters from March until August\n\n2008. Dkt. No. 5, at 4-6. On August 15, 2008, prison officials discovered memory cards\n\nrolled up in Muslim prayer rugs in a common area of the prison. The memory cards were\n\nconfiscated as contraband. On August 18, 2008, Abdul-Aziz told prison officials that the\n\nmemory cards belonged to him. On August 19, 2008, Abdul-Aziz was transferred to\n\nTCC status. Dkt. No. 43-1, at 29. The defendants argued in their brief that “Plaintiff\n\nwould have been placed in TCC, issued the same disciplinary charge, and treated in the\n\nsame manner even in the absence of his filing grievances and/or complaints.” Id. at 28.\n\nThis statement, along with the chronology following the memory cards’ discovery,\n\nestablished a legitimate penological purpose for TCC status, thus precluding the existence\n\nof a genuine issue of material fact and entitling the defendants summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.\n\n         Likewise, nothing in the record indicates that Abdul-Aziz’s reassignment to a\n\nlower-paying institutional job was the result of retaliation, as it was also done for a\n\nlegitimate penological purpose. Abdul-Aziz was working as a Forms Room file clerk on\n\nJanuary 29, 2009, when an NJSP official observed speakers connected to Abdul-Aziz’s\n\nworkstation computer. Music files were stored on the computer, and Abdul-Aziz had\n\nlistened them on at least one occasion. Dkt. No. 82-1, at ¶¶ 32-33. Inmates are not\n\npermitted to download music or games on the computers. As a result, Abdul-Aziz was\n\ncharged with a disciplinary infraction for misuse of electronic equipment, but it was\n\ndismissed because he was not served with the charge within the applicable time limit. Id.\n                                              10\n\fat ¶ 50. However, following the disposition of any infraction, all inmates must go before\n\nthe Institutional Classification Committee (“ICC”), which may look at the conduct\n\nunderlying the charge regardless of its outcome. Id. at ¶¶ 40-41. The ICC has the\n\ndiscretion to reassign an inmate to a different job if it determines that the safety and\n\nsecurity of the facility will be threatened by returning the inmate to the inmate’s former\n\nwork assignment. Id. at ¶ 43. Abdul-Aziz met with the ICC on February 11, 2009, and\n\nhe was subsequently reassigned from Forms Room clerk to cell sanitation. Id. at ¶ 19.\n\nThis reassignment took place nearly three months after he filed a lawsuit and nearly five\n\nmonths after he filed his last complaint. Abdul-Aziz admitted all of the facts mentioned\n\nabove in his counter-statement of facts (Dkt. No. 84-2), and therefore there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact as to whether his reassignment served a legitimate penological\n\ninterest. Summary judgment in favor of defendants was therefore appropriate regarding\n\nthis claim as well.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       There being no substantial question presented on appeal, we will summarily\n\naffirm.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n  To the extent Abdul-Aziz requests appointment of counsel in his argument in support of\nthe appeal, that request is denied.\n                                              11\n\f</pre>",
