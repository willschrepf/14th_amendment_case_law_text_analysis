In April\r\n2007, Father filed a petition to modify the parent-child relationship, seeking\r\nto reduce this amount. <span> </span>After hearing\r\nevidence pertaining to the parties’ income and the

the percentage\r\napplied to the obligor’s net resources for child support by the actual order\r\nrendered by the Court is 35%, reducing as each child is emancipated

over and above the presumptive award, as\r\nfollows:<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>$3,875.00 to

class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><span>          </span>The trial court concluded that because\r\nFather’s child support obligation was set at $6,500 per month, and because the children’s\r\nneeds exceeded that amount, it would not change the child support provisions in\r\nthe divorce decree. <span> </span>The trial court also\r\nadopted the following pertinent proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw:<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>2.<span>  </span>The amount of child support ordered by the\r\nCourt is in excess of the amount provided for by the percentage
