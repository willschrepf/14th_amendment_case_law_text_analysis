Defendants also appeal the district court’s denial\nof their subsequent motion to modify the Modified Order. We REVERSE the\ndistrict court’s denial of defendants’ motion to modify, and REVERSE and\nREMAND as to the district court’s finding of a violation of the Modified Order\nand Section 1703(f).\n                            I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       This appeal arises out of litigation with a long and complex procedural\nhistory. It is an offshoot of a suit originally filed in 1970 in the Eastern District\nof Texas by plaintiff-appellee, the United States, against defendants concerning\nnine all-black school districts located in northeastern Texas. The suit resulted\nin the district court’s issuance of the July 1971 Modified Order, a permanent\ninjunctive order that provided for the district court to supervise broad aspects\nof the State’s educational system and policies.1\n       The Modified Order contains a number of provisions. Pertinent to the\nmerits of this case is Section G, entitled “Curriculum and Compensatory\nEducation.” Section G is comprised of two subsections. The first, Section G(1),\ncontains broad language, providing that: “Defendants shall insure that school\ndistricts are providing equal educational opportunities in all schools.” Section\nG(2) is more specific and requires TEA to conduct a study of the educational\nneeds of minority children throughout the entire state and report its findings to\nthe district court.2\n\n\n       1\n          The district court’s original order was modified by this court on appeal, hence its\ntitle, “the Modified Order.” See United States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex. 1970),\nmodified and supplemented, 330 F. Supp. 235 (E.D. Tex. 1971), aff’d in part, modified in\npart and remanded, 447 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1971).\n       2\n        Specifically, Section G(2)(a) requires that TEA file a report containing\n“[r]ecommendations of specific curricular offerings and programs which will insure equal\n\n                                              2\n\f       Also pertinent is Section J of the Modified Order. Section J provides: “This\nCourt retains jurisdiction of this matter for all purposes, and especially for the\npurpose of entering any and all further orders which may become necessary to\nenforce or modify this decree.”\n       In 1972, plaintiffs-intervenors-appellees, LULAC and G.I. Forum\n(collectively, intervenors), were allowed to intervene as representatives of all\nMexican-Americans in Texas. In 1975, intervenors filed a motion to enforce\nSection G of the Modified Order, alleging that defendants were denying equal\neducational opportunities to Mexican-American students in Texas public schools.\nUnited States v. Texas (LULAC I), 506 F. Supp. 405, 410 (E.D. Tex. 1981), rev’d,\n680 F.2d 356 (5th Cir. 1982). Intervenors also alleged claims under the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Section 1703(f).\n       In its January 1981 opinion, the trial court rejected intervenors’ Section\nG claim, holding that “[s]ection G of the [Modified Order] required only the filing\nof a report to propose remedial programs,” and TEA had already fulfilled this\nrequirement. Id. at 410. Still, the trial court held that defendants had subjected\nMexican-Americans to past de jure discrimination, and the state’s failure to take\nappropriate action to meet language difficulties encountered by Mexican-\nAmerican LEP students constituted a violation of Section 1703(f). Id. at 411,\n433–34. On those grounds, the court ordered defendants to offer bilingual\ninstruction to all Mexican-American LEP students in Texas public schools.3 Id.\n\neducational opportunities for all students . . . [including] programs and curriculum designed\nto meet the special educational needs of students whose primary language is other than\nEnglish.” TEA complied with this subsection and has no residual obligations under it.\nUnited States v. Texas (LULAC I), 506 F. Supp. 405, 410 (E.D. Tex. 1981), rev’d, 680 F.2d\n356 (5th Cir. 1982).\n       3\n        On June 12, 1981, the Texas legislature enacted the 1981 Bilingual and Special\nLanguage Programs Act, which compelled bilingual education in kindergarten through\nsixth grade, thereby placing the state in substantial compliance with the trial court’s order.\n\n                                              3\n\fat 439–41.\n       Defendants appealed, and this court reversed and remanded. United\nStates v. Texas (LULAC II), 680 F.2d 356, 372 n. 25 (5th Cir. 1982). This court\nheld that the evidence did not support the trial court’s finding of past statewide\nde jure segregation of Mexican-Americans in Texas public schools. Id. at 362,\n369–71. We further held that the trial court should have granted defendants’\npost-trial motion to vacate due to the state’s enactment of new legislation. Id.\nat 372. Finally, this court expressed grave concern that no local school districts\nwere party to the case,4 and instructed the district court, before proceeding on\nremand, to determine “what questions—if any—presented by the case are\nsubject to resolution on a statewide basis.” Id. at 374. On remand, intervenors\ndid not seek, and the trial court did not make, any such determination, and\n\n\n\nUnited States v. Texas (LULAC II), 680 F.2d 356, 372 n. 25 (5th Cir. 1982). It also required\nTEA to conduct on-site monitoring to insure local districts were complying with the Act. Id.\nIn light of this legislative action, the state filed a post-trial motion to vacate the injunctive\nremedy as moot. Id. The district court denied the motion. Id.\n       4\n           Specifically, this court’s opinion stated:\n\n       “. . . [T]he geographical distribution of Mexican-American students in Texas . .\n       . is anything but homogeneous across the state; hence conditions vary\n       substantially from school district to school district, some districts comprising\n       heavy majorities of Mexican-American students, some having virtually none .\n       . . [T]here exists little if any practical or logical justification for attempting to\n       deal on a statewide basis with the problems presented by this case. . . The State\n       of Texas, qua state, directly educates no one; this is the work of the school\n       districts . . . [T]he language problems to be met will necessarily vary by district\n       . . . . [W]hether the effect of a local language program, state-mandated or not,\n       constitutes appropriate action to deal with language barriers faced by the\n       students of a given school district will of necessity be an essentially local question.\n       . . . We fail to see how [this case] can be properly resolved in the absence of the\n       school district concerned or how [it] can effectively be dealt with on a statewide\n       basis.”\n\nId. at 373–74 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                   4\n\fnothing became of the case for some twenty-four years.\n       On February 9, 2006, however, intervenors filed a motion for further relief\nunder the Modified Order, again alleging violations of Section G and Section\n1703(f). On February 28, 2006, the United States intervened in a limited\ncapacity.\n       On July 27, 2007, after a five-day bench trial, the district court denied\nintervenors’ motion. United States v. Texas (LULAC III), No. 6:71-CV-5281,\n2007 WL 2177369, at *18 (E.D. Tex. July 27, 2007).5 The district court held that\nintervenors failed to establish a Section G violation because no evidence of past\nstatewide de jure segregation of Mexican-Americans was presented. Id. at *9.\nFurther, the trial court held that intervenors failed to prove a Section 1703(f)\nviolation because, viewing the panoptic results, the evidence showed that\n“language barriers are actually being overcome as to [primary LEP students],”\nand intervenors “failed to link [data indicating under-performance by secondary\nLEP students] with any flaw in Texas’s bilingual/ESL program.” Id. at *18.\n       On August 13, 2007, intervenors filed a motion to amend the judgment,\narguing that the district court committed a manifest error of law and fact by\nignoring the failure of the secondary LEP language program. Nearly a year\n\n\n       5\n         Prior to the bench trial, defendants filed multiple motions to dismiss on\njurisdictional and standing grounds. The trial court dismissed all of defendants’\njurisdictional claims, holding that it retained jurisdiction over intervenors’ Modified Order\nclaims under Section J, and it could exercise jurisdiction over intervenors’ supplemental\nEEOA claim as a “successive motion” that “lineally descended” from intervenors’ 1981\naction. United States v. Texas (LULAC IV), 572 F. Supp. 2d 726, 732–33 (E.D. Tex. 2008).\nThe district court also held that intervenors had associational standing because LULAC\nidentified 14 members who were parents of one or more LEP students. In total, these 14\nmembers represented 20 children, 7 of whom attended schools in Dallas Independent\nSchool District, 12 in Del Valle Independent School District, and one in Manor Independent\nSchool District (the latter two school districts are located in Travis County, in the Western\nDistrict of Texas, the first district is located in Dallas County, in the Northern District of\nTexas).\n\n                                              5\n\flater, on July 24, 2008, the trial court granted the intervenors’ motion to\nreconsider the prior judgment, “in order to correct clear and manifest errors of\nlaw and fact upon which the judgment is based.” United States v. Texas (LULAC\nIV), 572 F. Supp. 2d 726, 730 (E.D. Tex. 2008). The trial court then vacated its\nJuly 27, 2007 order in full, and entered a new judgment, holding that defendants\nhad violated both the Modified Order and Section 1703(f). Id. at 755, 762. In\ntaking these actions the trial court relied primarily on new “persuasive”\nauthority, namely Flores v. Arizona, 516 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2008).6 It then\ngranted a remedial decree pursuant to the EEOA violation, ordering defendants\nto “establish a new monitoring system and establish a language program that\nfulfill the requirements of the [EEOA],” “to submit a monitoring plan addressing\n[failures of the monitoring program,] and to submit a proposed new language\nprogram for secondary LEP students by January 31, 2009.” From that decision,\nthe defendants timely appealed.\n\n\n       6\n           Thus, the trial court’s July 24, 2008 opinion states, for example:\n\n       “A persuasive February 22, 2008 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of\n       Appeals, Flores v. Arizona, 516 F.3d 1140 (9th Cir. 2008), allowed the Court\n       to perceive its previous clear and manifest errors of fact and law, regarding\n       the application of NCLB requirements to EEOA implementation and the\n       court’s analysis of the distinct bilingual and ESL programs. Persuaded by\n       the circuit court, this Court adopts conclusions of law from the holdings in\n       Flores.”\n\nId., 572 F. Supp. 2d at 759-60, and,\n\n       “As discussed infra, the holdings in Flores persuaded the Court that it\n       committed clear and manifest error in its factual finding that it was\n       compelled to consider the ‘panoptic results’ of LEP students in all grades\n       rather than considering the achievement of primary and secondary students\n       separately.”\n\nId., 572 F. Supp. 2d at 762. However, after this appeal was taken, the Supreme Court\nreversed the Ninth Circuit’s Flores decision. Horne v. Flores, 129 S.Ct. 2579 (2009).\n\n                                                 6\n\f      On August 18, 2008, defendants filed a motion to further modify the\nModified Order, arguing that this court’s recent decision in Samnorwood\nIndependent School District v. Texas Education Agency, 533 F.3d 258 (5th Cir.\n2008), constituted a change in law and required that the Modified Order’s\napplication be limited to the original school districts in the 1970 action. The\ntrial court granted in part, and denied in part, defendants’ motion, and amended\nthe Modified Order to exempt the two Samnorwood school districts and all\n“school districts that: (1) were not parties to the original 1970 litigation; (2) were\nunitary prior to the commencement of the 1970 litigation; and (3) have never\nsince been shown to have attempted to resegregate or act with segregative\nintent.”     United States v. Texas (LULAC V), No. 6:71-CV-5281, 2008 WL\n5334404, at *7 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 17, 2008). Defendants also appeal from that order.\n             II. TRIAL COURT’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\nBackground\n      Chapter 29 of the Texas Education Code mandates bilingual education and\nEnglish as a second language (“ESL”) programs in all Texas schools. TEX. EDUC.\nCODE § 29.051. Bilingual programs are offered in kindergarten through sixth\ngrade (primary education), while ESL programs are offered in seventh through\ntwelfth grade (secondary education). LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 736.\nHowever, local school districts may elect either bilingual or ESL programs “or\nother transitional language instruction” for the seventh and eighth grade LEP\nstudents. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 29.053(d)(2).7 These programs are significantly\ndifferent; bilingual instruction teaches course materials in both English and the\nstudent’s native language, while ESL instruction teaches materials in modified\nEnglish for easier comprehension by LEP students. LULAC IV, 572 F.2d at 735.\n\n\n      7\n          In the years in evidence, apparently all used ESL.\n\n                                               7\n\fStudents’ participation in bilingual and ESL programs is subject to parental\npermission, which may be, and sometimes is, withheld.\n      Under the Texas Education Code, “[t]he school districts and charter\nschools created in accordance with the laws of this state have the primary\nresponsibility for implementing the state’s system of public education and\nensuring student performance in accordance with this code.” TEX. EDUC. CODE\n§ 11.002. And, “[a]n educational function not specifically delegated to [TEA] is\nreserved to and shall be performed by school districts or open-enrollment charter\nschools.” Id. § 7.003. Under Section 7.021(b), TEA is given diverse powers to\n“administer and monitor compliance.” TEA is given certain authority respecting\nmonitoring compliance with various programs, including the state bilingual\neducation and ESL programs. Id. §§ 29.051-29.064. Under Section 7.028(a),\nsuch compliance monitoring function extends “only as necessary to ensure . . .\ncompliance with federal law and regulations” (and financial integrity and certain\n“data integrity”); and under section 7.028(b), “[t]he board of trustees of a school\ndistrict or the governing body of an open-enrollment charter school has primary\nresponsibility for ensuring that the district or school complies with all applicable\nrequirements of state educational programs.” TEA is required to “evaluate the\neffectiveness of [bilingual and ESL] programs” as “compared to state established\nstandards.” Id. §§ 29.062(a), 39.053(c). Factors to be considered include, among\nother things, drop-out rates, graduation rates, and standardized test passing\nrates. Id. § 39.053(c).\n      In 2003, the TEA’s previous monitoring program to evaluate program\ncompliance was replaced with the Performance Based Monitoring Analysis\nSystem (PBMAS). PBMAS was first implemented in the 2004–2005 school year.\nAnnually, the PBMAS generates a set of performance indicators on the district-\nlevel, based mostly on student passage rates on the Texas Assessment of\n\n                                         8\n\fKnowledge and Skills (TAKS), a statewide achievement test. Each year the\nstate sets standards for student passage rates in five subject areas and compares\ndistricts' performance to these standards. TEA assigns each district a\nperformance level based upon the deviation of the district's passage rates from\nthe state established standards. And a district’s performance level determines\nwhether the district will be subject to intervention and to what degree. In terms\nof LEP students, PBMAS evaluates the bilingual and ESL program using TAKS\nscores of LEP students, as well as other indicators, including the LEP annual\ndrop-out rate, the LEP graduation rate, and LEP reading proficiency. At the\ntime of the trial court’s evidentiary hearing, only two years’ worth of PBMAS\ndata was available—the 2004–2005 school year and the 2005–2006 school year.\nProblems With PBMAS\n      The district court identified two overall problems with TEA’s monitoring\nprocedures: (1) the kind of data collected by PBMAS inaccurately reflects how\nwell a district is performing and cannot adequately detect deficiencies at the\ncampus level; and (2) TEA’s inadequate response to problems flagged by PBMAS\ncontributes to the denial of educational opportunity.\n      In particular, the court determined that data collected by PBMAS show\nthat some school districts are likely under-reporting the number of LEP\nstudents, and TEA has done nothing to verify these numbers. The court also\nfound that although TEA compared the bilingual-ESL indicators to state\nstandards for all students, TEA has no procedure for comparing the performance\nof LEP students to non-LEP students directly. The court further found that\nPBMAS’s aggregation of scores for multiple grade levels as well as for entire\nschool districts distorted the performance indicators and masked problems at\nspecific schools.\n      With respect to on-site visits, the court determined that TEA had not\n\n                                       9\n\fconducted any on-site monitoring for some years and had no bilingual-ESL\ncertified monitors at the time of the trial. The court also considered other ways\nTEA monitors LEP students, such as monitoring that it performs under the No\nChild Left Behind (NCLB) program and the Texas accountability rating system.\nThe court found that, although some of these monitoring programs disaggregate\nstudent performance data, they do not overcome the deficiencies in PBMAS\nbecause they do not target all relevant criteria for evaluating LEP students.\nAchievement Of LEP Students\n       The district court also found that too high a proportion of the statewide\nsecondary LEP student population were failing. At all grade levels and in all\nsubject areas, secondary LEP students are performing poorly on TAKS. In fact,\nsecondary LEP students have much lower passage rates on standardized tests\nthan the general student body—creating a significant gap in achievement that\nranges (roughly) between thirty-five and forty-five percentage points.                  Also,\nsecondary LEP students have higher retention and drop-out rates when\ncompared to the general student population. “LEP students fail to progress\nthrough or exit LEP programs in a reasonable time.” LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp.\n2d at 751. And LEP students participate in advanced courses at a “far lower\nrate than all students.”8 Id. at 752.\n       The trial court made no finding or determination that with respect to\nprimary grades (kindergarten through sixth grade) the defendants had violated\nSection 1703(f).\n                                   III. DISCUSSION\nA. Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n\n       8\n       The trial court’s findings in this respect are extremely lengthy and detailed; for a\nmore complete recital of these, see the trial court’s opinion. 572 F. Supp. 2d at 738–42,\n747–53.\n\n                                             10\n\f      The United States and intervenors first argue that this court lacks\njurisdiction to review the interlocutory LEP Order. We disagree.\n      28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) provides this court with jurisdiction over\n“[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States . . . granting,\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve\nor modify injunctions.” The trial court ordered that defendants “establish a\nmonitoring system and establish a language program that fulfill the\nrequirements of the Equal Education Opportunity Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f)” for\nthe 2009–2010 academic year and thereafter. The LEP order also requires\ndefendants to “submit a monitoring plan addressing the failures of PBMAS and\nto submit a proposed new language program for secondary LEP students by\nJanuary 31, 2009, or earlier.” Id. We find these instructions to be sufficiently\ncoercive to constitute a mandatory injunction appealable under Section\n1292(a)(1). See Morales v. Turman, 535 F.2d 864, 867 n.6 (5th Cir. 1976), rev’d\non other grounds, 97 S.Ct. 1189 (1977); see also Morales, 97 S.Ct. at 1190 (the\ndistrict court’s “judgment is reviewable on the merits in the Court of Appeals”).\n      Though the above instructions do not specify the plan’s exact content,\ndefendants were ordered to affirmatively (and promptly) act to establish a\nmonitoring system and to devise and implement a new secondary LEP program.\nThere are over 1,200 school districts in the State of Texas. Devising a new\nmonitoring system and secondary LEP language program for all of these\ndistricts would require extraordinary effort. Defendants would not only be\nforced to address a wide variety of concerns, e.g., funding, staffing, and even\ntheir own legislative authority to create and carry out such a plan, they would\nalso need to implement substantial changes systemwide in a very short period\nof time.\n      Because the district court’s order compels defendants to promptly and\n\n                                        11\n\faffirmatively act in a specific and extremely extensive manner, the order\nconstitutes a mandatory injunction over which this court may assert its\nappellate jurisdiction.\nB. Standard of Review\n      The district court’s order granting intervenors’ motion to alter the\njudgment, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 52(b) and 59(e), is\nreviewed for abuse of discretion. See Ross v. Marshall, 426 F.3d 745, 763 (5th\nCir. 2005), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1166 (2007). “A district court abuses its\ndiscretion if it ‘bases its decision on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly\nerroneous assessment of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting Hesling v. CSX Transp.,\nInc., 396 F.3d 632, 638 (5th Cir. 2005)). In granting intervenors’ motion to alter\nthe judgment, the district court held that defendants violated both the Modified\nOrder and the EEOA. Thus, this court must independently review both holdings\nfor abuse of discretion.\nC. Section G of the Modified Order\n      The district court retained remedial jurisdiction over all actions brought\nto enforce or amend the Modified Order. Modified Order, Section J. Intervenors\nseek to enforce the Modified Order by invoking the broad language of Section\nG(1), which requires defendants to “insure that school districts are providing\nequal educational opportunities in all schools.” Id. at Section G. Thus, the\ndistrict court appropriately asserted jurisdiction over intervenors’ claim. After\nreviewing the evidence, the district court held that defendants violated Section\nG because PBMAS’s flaws were so significant that defendants could not\neffectively insure that LEP students received equal educational opportunities in\nTexas public schools. We conclude that this holding was in error.\n      “The Modified Order directs Defendants to take affirmative steps to\neliminate all remaining vestiges of the former de jure segregated school system\n\n                                        12\n\fin Texas, to prevent the recurrence of a segregated system, and to achieve fully\nintegrated schools.” LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 753 (citing United States v.\nTexas, 793 F.2d 636, 642 (5th Cir. 1986)). Significantly, the district court retains\nbroad remedial jurisdiction only “over those facets of school operations [that]\nrepresent or flow from an earlier de jure discriminatory system.” United States\nv. Texas (Goodrich), 158 F.3d 299, 311 (5th Cir. 1998). Thus, to find a violation\nof the Modified Order, the trial court must determine that the contested action\n“represents or flows” from a de jure segregated or discriminatory system. As\ndefendants are state actors and the trial court ordered a statewide remedy, the\ndecision below cannot be upheld absent a showing of statewide de jure\nsegregation of Mexican-Americans.\n       This court has repeatedly acknowledged the historical and statewide de\njure segregation of black and white students in Texas, but has held that at no\ntime “ha[s] Texas segregated Anglo students from Mexican-American ones by\nlaw.” United States v. Gregory Portland Independent School District, 654 F.2d\n989, 992 (5th Cir. 1981). Nor is the trial court entitled to presume such\nstatewide de jure segregation absent an evidentiary hearing. See id. at 998. The\ntrial court made no factual findings with regard to statewide de jure segregation\nof Mexican-Americans,9 nor would the record here support such a finding.\n\n\n       9\n        The trial court did state that: “this Court has already found [in the 1981\nintervention], and the Fifth Circuit has upheld, that TEA and the State of Texas [were]\ninvolved in intentional discrimination against Spanish speaking Mexican-American\nstudents [in the past].” LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 756. The district court clearly\nmisunderstood this court’s 1982 decision, where we reversed the district court’s findings\nand held that there was not adequate “factual support for the [district] court’s finding of\nhistorical segregation of Mexican-Americans.” LULAC II, 680 F.2d at 370. The district\ncourt also ignored this court’s determination in Gregory-Portland that no such system\nexisted. 654 F.2d at 992. Thus, the lower court erred in concluding that Mexican-\nAmericans suffered statewide de jure discrimination in the past (although the court\ndisclaimed basing its presently challenged orders on any such determination, 572 F. Supp.\n\n                                            13\n\fBecause there is no showing of statewide de jure segregation of Mexican-\nAmericans, the trial court cannot enforce Section G under the facts and claims\npresented.\n       Further, the district court erred in relying on its broad remedial\njurisdiction under the Modified Order to assert jurisdiction over intervenors’\nEEOA claim.       In determining whether it had jurisdiction, the trial court\nreasoned that, because intervenors’ claims were a continuation of the 1981\nintervention under the Modified Order, the “instant action [was] a successive\nmotion . . . lineally descending from the Fifth Circuit’s remand in [1982].”\nLULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 732. Yet, the trial court had previously held that\nintervenors’ 1981 Section G claim was without merit. LULAC I, 506 F. Supp. at\n410.   There, the trial court held that Section G only required defendants to\nconduct a study and file a report proposing remedial programs for, among other\nthings, curricular offerings for students who primarily spoke a language other\nthan English. Id. at 411. And intervenors’ Section G claim was denied because\nTEA timely satisfied this obligation.10 Id. at 411.\n       It is unclear to this court how intervenors’ claim could be a successive\nmotion when the original claim was previously denied. And even if, as the trial\ncourt suggests, intervenors raised new facts suggesting a violation of Section G’s\nbroader principle of equal educational opportunities, there has been no finding\nof statewide de jure segregation of Mexican-Americans in Texas. Thus, the lower\ncourt erred in finding that intervenors could establish a Section G violation, and\n\n\n2d at 758).\n       10\n         The trial court addressed this apparent contradiction between the present order on\nappeal and the original 1981 order, reasoning that “it is abundantly clear that [it] was\nreferring to Section G(2), and therefore did not hold that Section G(1) [sic], which has\nnothing to do with the reporting requirement, was complied with by virtue of filing the\nreport.”\n\n                                            14\n\fthe district court should not have exercised jurisdiction over intervenors’\nsupplemental EEOA claim pursuant to its remedial jurisdiction over the\nModified Order.\n      Because intervenors’ Section G claim was invalid pursuant to the district\ncourt’s own order in 1981 and Fifth Circuit precedent, we hold that intervenors’\nSection G and EEOA claims should have been severed into entirely separate\nlawsuits.\nD. Equal Educational Opportunities Act\n      1. Absence of Local Districts\n      The district court’s finding of an EEOA violation is unreliable because the\ndistrict court failed to adequately address this circuit’s 1982 remand\ninstructions. In 1982, this court questioned whether intervenors’ EEOA claim\ncould be appropriately addressed absent local school districts as parties.\nSpecifically, we concluded that “there exists little if any practical or logical\njustification for attempting to deal on a statewide basis with the problems\npresented by this case.” LULAC II, 680 F.2d at 373–74. See also note 4, supra.\nAnd we remanded the action to the district court with the following instructions:\n      “[T]he language problems to be met will necessarily vary by district\n      . . . . [W]hether the effect of a local language program,\n      state-mandated or not, constitutes appropriate action to deal with\n      language barriers faced by the students of a given school district\n      will of necessity be an essentially local question. . . . We fail to see\n      how [a question of Section 1703(f) compliance] can be properly\n      resolved in the absence of the school district concerned or how [it]\n      can effectively be dealt with on a statewide basis. . . . [W]e therefore\n      direct the district court to determine . . . what questions—if\n      any—presented by the case are subject to resolution on a statewide\n      basis before proceeding further on the remand that we mandate.”\nId. at 374.\n      In light of this court’s analysis of the evidence below, we conclude that the\n\n                                        15\n\fissues raised by intervenors’ EEOA claim have not been properly addressed in\nthe absence of individual school districts as parties.\n      This court notes that intervenors identified fourteen LULAC members who\nwere parents of one or more LEP students. Those parents represent, in total,\ntwenty LEP students attending schools within three individual school districts.\nSee also note 5, supra. Not one of these school districts is named as a party to\nthis action or located within the Eastern District of Texas.\n      Further, because no school district is a party to the present litigation, the\nissue remains as to whether the district court constitutes an “appropriate\ndistrict court” capable of asserting jurisdiction over intervenors’ claim. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1708 (“The appropriate district court of the United States shall have\nand exercise jurisdiction of proceedings instituted under [this statute].”\n(emphasis added)).      The district court improperly relied on its remedial\njurisdiction under the Modified Order to assert jurisdiction over intervenors’\nsupplemental EEOA claim; thus, it failed to adequately address whether it\nconstituted an “appropriate district court” pursuant to Section 1708. Congress\ndid not define “appropriate district court” in the statute, and there is little\nlegislative history or judicial precedent on the issue.\n      We conclude that “an appropriate district court” is normally the district\ncourt in which a local school district, as a party to the action, is located. And\nonce one or more local districts are added as parties in this litigation, the district\ncourt should reconsider whether it constitutes an “appropriate district court” for\njurisdictional purposes or if the case should, instead, be handled in a forum that\nconstitutes a proper venue for such additional parties.\n      2. The Evidence Presented Below\n      This court’s decision regarding the necessity of a local school district is\nfurther supported because the record below is insufficient to uphold the trial\n\n                                         16\n\fcourt’s finding of an EEOA violation. To find a violation of, and order a remedy\nunder, the EEOA, intervenors must establish (1) a violation of a student’s rights\nunder the EEOA, (2) that the violation “stem[med] from a failure to take\n‘appropriate action’” on the part of the defendants, Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605, and\n(3) that any remedial order is “essential to correct [the] particular denials” of\nEEOA rights found. 20 U.S.C. § 1712. We conclude that intervenors failed to\nmake the requisite showing.\n       Under the EEOA, a state may not “deny equal educational opportunity to\nan individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by . . .\nthe failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome\nlanguage barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its\ninstructional programs.” 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f) (emphasis added). Both state and\nlocal educational agencies are responsible for taking “appropriate action” under\nthe statute,11 but the EEOA “leave[s] state and local educational authorities a\nsubstantial amount of latitude in choosing the program and techniques they\nwould use to meet their obligations under the EEOA.” Castaneda v. Pickard,\n648 F.2d 989, 1009–10 (5th Cir. 1981).             See also Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2589\n(quoting Castaneda), id. at 2595 (“. . . [T]he EEOA itself limits court-ordered\nremedies to those that ‘are essential to correct particular denials of equal\neducational opportunity or equal protection of the laws,’” (quoting 20 U.S.C. §\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          The EEOA defines “educational agency” as “a local educational agency or a ‘State\neducational agency,’” and a state educational agency as “the agency primarily responsible\nfor the State supervision of public elementary schools and secondary schools.” 20 U.S.C.§§\n1720(a), 7801(41); see Gomez v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., 811 F.2d 1030, 1042–43 (7th Cir.\n1987) (holding that, where powers are retained by the state or its educational agency, the\nstate is obligated to take appropriate action under § 1703(f)); Idaho Migrant Council v. Bd.\nof Educ., 647 F.2d 69, 71 (9th Cir. 1981) (holding that the EEOA “imposes requirements on\nthe State Agency to ensure that . . . language deficiencies are addressed”).\n\n                                             17\n\f1712, emphasis by Supreme Court)).12\n       “[T]he State of Texas has chosen a system of shared responsibilities\nbetween state actors and local officials” in educational matters. LULAC IV, 572\nF. Supp. 2d at 757. Under this system, local school districts are primarily\nresponsible for the implementation of LEP programs, while TEA is responsible\nfor ensuring compliance with federal and state law and evaluating and\nmonitoring the effectiveness of LEP programs.             TEX. EDUC. CODE §§ 7.003,\n7.021(b)(1), 7.028, 11.002, 29.062. Thus, defendants’ liability under the EEOA\nis dependent upon the extent to which they have failed to take “appropriate\naction” in fulfilling their legal responsibilities under state law – which in this\ncase requires that they monitor and evaluate LEP programs via PBMAS – which\nfailure has caused a deprivation of the rights of Mexican-American LEP students\nunder Section 1703(f).\n       To determine the appropriateness of an educational agency’s action, this\ncourt has instituted a three-prong test: (1) whether the program is based on\nsound educational theory, (2) whether reasonable efforts are being made to\nimplement the theory (implementation prong), and (3) whether the program,\nover a legitimate period of time, has achieved some success in overcoming\nlanguage barriers (results prong). Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009–10. After\n\n\n\n       12\n          Moreover, while the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) does not replace\nSection 1703(f) (and compliance with the former does not necessarily constitute compliance\nwith the latter), nevertheless, as Horne states:\n        “NCLB marked a dramatic shift in federal education policy. It reflects\n        Congress’ judgment that the best way to raise the level of education\n        nationwide is by granting state and local officials flexibility to develop and\n        implement educational programs that address local needs, while holding\n        them accountable for the results. . . . NCLB conditions the continued receipt\n        of funds on demonstrations of ‘adequate yearly progress.’” Id. at 2601.\nTitle III of NCLB specifically focuses on LEP students and their acquisition of English\nlanguage proficiency. Id.\n\n                                            18\n\fapplying the above analysis, the district court concluded that defendants’ use of\nPBMAS in its current form fails both the implementation prong and the results\nprong.13\n       The district court’s ruling that a given defendant has or has not taken the\n“appropriate action” required of it under section 1703(f) presents “a mixed\nquestion of fact and law,” review of which requires us to determine whether the\ntrial court’s “conclusion was adequately supported by subsidiary findings of fact\nwhich do not appear clearly erroneous.” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1010. Whether\nsuch essentially historic facts adequately support the conclusion presents a\nquestion of law reviewable de novo. See St. Tammany Parish Sch. Bd. v.\nLouisiana, 142 F.3d 776, 782 (5th Cir. 1998).14 To the extent that the subsidiary\nfindings of fact are “premised upon an erroneous view of controlling legal\nprinciples” they “are entitled to no deference.” Johnson v. Uncle Ben’s, Inc., 628\nF.2d 419, 422 (5th Cir. 1980).15\n               a. Implementation Prong\n       Under the implementation prong, a court must determine whether\ndefendants’ implementation of PBMAS “follow[s] through with practices,\nresources and personnel necessary to transform the [educational] theory into\n\n       13\n        It is undisputed that defendants’ primary and secondary LEP programs are based\nupon sound educational theory. See, e.g., 572 F. Supp. 2d at 763-64 (“There is no dispute\nthat Defendants’ bilingual and ESL programs are sound in theory.”).\n       14\n         “. . . [O]ur court will ‘review de novo, as a mixed question of law and fact, a district\ncourt’s [merits-] decision that a local school district’s IEP was or was not appropriate and\nthat an alternative placement was or was not inappropriate under the IDEA.’” Id. (quoting\nCypress Fairbanks ISD v. Michael F., 118 F.3d 245, 252 (5th Cir. 1997)).\n       15\n           See also, e.g., Lake Charles Stevedores v. Professor Vladimer Popov MV, 199 F.3d\n220, 223 (5th Cir. 1999); Johnson v. Hospital Corp. of America, 95 F.3d 383, 395 (5th Cir.\n1996); Delta S.S. Lines, Inc. v. Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 747 F.2d 995, 1000 (5th Cir. 1984)\n(“. . . [W]hen essentially based on an incorrect legal principle, Rule 52(a) clearly erroneous\ndoes not apply and we disregard any such possible findings.”).\n\n                                               19\n\freality.” Castenada, 648 F.2d at 1010. Essentially, this Court must scrutinize\nwhether defendants have made a “bona fide effort[] to make the program work.”\nId.\n      According to the district court, defendants failed the implementation prong\nbecause PBMAS, as implemented, cannot effectively monitor the progress of LEP\nprograms and students. LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 765. The trial court\nidentified a variety of “flaws” that rendered the system ineffective: (1) the\nabsence of equality based comparisons, (2) under-identification of LEP students,\nand (3) the aggregation of data at the district level.\n                   1. Equality Based Comparisons\n      First, the trial court determined that PBMAS was flawed because it did\nnot make equality based comparisons between LEP and non-LEP students.\nData collected under PBMAS compares LEP student achievement to state\nassigned target passage rates; a district’s deviation from state targets\ndetermines its performance level, which in turn determines whether and to what\ndegree TEA will intervene. Thus, PBMAS does not directly compare LEP\nstudent achievement with non-LEP student achievement, and absent such a\ndirect comparison, the district court concluded that the program could not\nadequately monitor the effectiveness of LEP programs.        The only basis the\ndistrict court provided for this conclusion was that the EEOA is an equality\nbased statute.\n      Federal law provides no instruction as to how states should analyze LEP\nstudent achievement. But the Supreme Court did recently hold that “the EEOA\nrequires ‘appropriate action’ to remove language barriers, § 1703(f), not the\nequalization of results between native and nonnative speakers on tests\nadministered in English.”      Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605.     And by state law,\ndefendants are only required to “evaluate the effectiveness of [bilingual and\n\n                                        20\n\fESL] programs” as “compared to state-established standards.” TEX. EDUC. CODE\n§§ 29.062(a), 39.053(b). We do not believe that EEOA compliance requires the\ncomparisons insisted on by the district court.\n      Further, reasonable minds could differ over what comparative method is\nmost effective to determine whether language barriers are being overcome. The\nState of Texas and the TEA have determined that success is best measured by\ndetermining whether LEP students are achieving state-passage rate targets, and\nthere is no evidence that the district court’s preferred method of comparison is\nbetter than that of the State’s.\n      In fact, the district court’s method comes with significant faults. For\nexample, standardized tests are administered to secondary LEP students in\nEnglish, a language in which they, by definition, lack proficiency. Horne, 129\nS.Ct. at 2603 n.16; Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1014. English administration makes\nit difficult for test results to accurately capture an LEP student’s knowledge of\ncore curriculum, and it is inevitable that such students will not perform as well\nas non-LEP students. Also, once an LEP student has successfully completed a\nlanguage remediation program, he or she is no longer identified as LEP,\nrendering it impossible for a direct comparison to adequately capture program\nsuccesses. Thus, a direct comparison between LEP and non-LEP students may\nnot adequately represent the actual achievement gap between the two groups.\nAnd, by making equality a priority, districts with a significant gap in passage\nrates will require intervention regardless of how high LEP student scores might\nbe, whereas no intervention will occur in districts where LEP and non-LEP\nstudents have lower, but reasonably equivalent, scores.\n      The district court failed to adequately acknowledge any of the above\ncriticisms and, instead, abused its discretion by supplanting defendants’\neducational policy decision with its own judgment.        Moreover, there is no\n\n                                       21\n\fevidence that any such method of comparison deficiency caused any deprivation\nof the Section 1703(f) rights of Mexican-American LEP students.\n                      2. Under-identification of LEP Students\n       The district court also determined that school districts are “likely” under-\nidentifying LEP students. LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 767–68. TEA is tasked\nwith establishing criteria for identification, assessment, and classification of\nLEP students. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 29.056(a). Once a student is identified as\nLEP, the district must obtain parental consent for the child to take part in an\nLEP program. Id. However, parents may, and sometimes do, deny consent.\n       At trial, intervenors presented evidence that, while the state average of\nparental denials is 4.9%, some districts have reported a significantly higher\npercentage of denials.16 Based on this evidence, the trial court determined that\nthose districts must be under-identifying LEP students, and this under-\nidentification decreases the perceived achievement gap between LEP and non-\nLEP students. LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 767–68.\n       We find that the district court reached this conclusion in error. The\ndistrict court based its conclusion on the belief that a parental denial altered the\nidentification of the student, so that the child is no longer characterized as LEP.\n\n       16\n          Intervenors also presented evidence that some districts report a significantly lower\npercentage of LEP students than the county-wide percentage of households in which a\nlanguage other than English is spoken. To the extent that the district court based its\nfinding of under-identification on this evidence, we find that this conclusion was in error.\nThe percentage of households in which a language other than English is spoken does not in\nany meaningful way evidence the number of LEP students residing within the county.\n        The district court also observed “it appears that in at least some of these schools [in\ndistricts with high rates of parental denials], parents may not be well informed of the\nadvantages of bilingual-ESL programs or may be subject of coercion” (emphasis added).\nThere is no substantial evidence of instances of any such “coercion” (or misinformation),\nand in any event the above quoted observations are entirely too vague and speculative to\nform any valid basis for relief against defendants. Finally, there is no substantial evidence\nof any default by defendants in performance of their duties in this respect causing Mexican-\nAmerican LEP students’ loss of their § 1703(f) rights.\n\n                                              22\n\fId. at 767–68. This conclusion is entirely incorrect—once students are identified\nas LEP, they remain identified as such until they obtain English proficiency,\nregardless of participation in the program. Thus, the district court abused its\ndiscretion in determining that the PBMAS data was unreliable due to the under-\nidentification of LEP students.\n                     3. Aggregation of Data\n       The district court also took issue with the PBMAS monitoring system’s\naggregation of data at the district level.17 Id. at 768. The district court held that\nthis comparative method prevents intervention on individual campuses that are\nnot performing as well as the district overall. In reaching this conclusion, the\ncourt relied upon a study which showed that 277 schools, attended by a total of\n54,963 LEP students, performed at a performance level lower than the stage of\nintervention required by the district’s assigned performance level.18 However,\nthis study did not ascertain the total number of campuses in need of intervention\nor the total number of campuses subject to intervention based on the district-\nwide data. Thus, it did not provide what percentage of campuses in need of\nintervention or subject to intervention these 277 campuses actually represented.\n       Rather than questioning the significance of the report, the trial court\nperfunctorily concluded that aggregation of data at the district level rendered\nthe PBMAS monitoring system ineffective. Further, the trial court determined\n\n\n       17\n         The trial court also disapproved of TEA’s aggregation of TAKS subject data across\nmultiple grade levels. Defendants explained that TAKS subjects are not annually\nadministered at each grade level; thus, to determine achievement in specific subjects,\nTAKS scores for each subject are combined across the grade levels in which the subject test\nwas administered. The district court held that this allowed the scores of successful primary\nstudents to overinflate the success of the entire group, thus masking the underperformance\nof secondary LEP students.\n       18\n       These numbers represent only 3.4% of campuses within the state and 7.7% of the\nLEP student population.\n\n                                            23\n\fthat it would be more reasonable for TEA to analyze data at the campus level to\navoid this “masking effect.”19 This conclusion ignores the allocation of shared\nresponsibilities within the Texas education system. Under Texas’s system, local\ndistricts are primarily responsible for implementing LEP programs, and\naddressing and remedying under-performing campuses within their own district.\nOn the other hand, TEA is responsible for intervening in failing districts to\nensure overall compliance.20\n       There is no finding nor sufficient evidence that individual districts are\nignoring LEP under-performance on individual campuses or sufficient evidence\nof resulting actual harm to such campuses and their students. We accordingly\nfind that the district court abused its discretion in supplanting defendants’ policy\nchoice with its own preferred method of comparison.21\n       On remand, the district court should reconsider the evidence, in light of\nthis court’s opinion, to properly determine whether PBMAS, coupled with other\nsources of information (such as NCLB), is capable of effectively monitoring the\nsuccess of LEP programs and whether any such monitoring deficiencies of\ndefendants (together with any others so found) amount to a failure to take\n\n       19\n        The district court felt a campus-level analysis was reasonable because TEA\nalready collects both district-wide and campus data.\n       20\n        In holding that the evidence adduced thus far fails to establish that the PBMAS\nmonitoring system does not discharge the State’s responsibilities under the EEOA, we do\nnot necessarily foreclose a finding upon more factual development that district-wide\nmonitoring may be inappropriate for larger school districts because of its potential for\nmasking the deficiencies on individual campuses (nor do we now give either legal blessing\nor condemnation to any such finding on further factual development).\n       21\n         The district court also explained that defendants should monitor at the campus\nlevel because the Modified Order was originally purposed to remedy segregation on the\ncampus level and Section G requires that equal opportunities be provided in “all schools.”\nTo the extent the trial court relied in any way on the Modified Order to reach the above\nconclusions, we find it committed error because there has been no showing of statewide de\njure segregation against Mexican-Americans.\n\n                                            24\n\fappropriate action under Section 1703(f) which caused a denial of the rights of\nMexican-American LEP students thereunder.\n             b. Results Prong\n      Under the results prong, this court must determine whether defendants’\nprogram, “after being employed for a period of time sufficient to give the plan a\nlegitimate trial, [failed] to produce results indicating that the language barriers\nconfronting students are actually being overcome,” and thus, “no longer\nconstitute[s] appropriate action.” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1010. Under this\nprong, the district court determined that the evidence presented—including\ndrop-out rates, retention rates, and the achievement scores of LEP secondary\nstudents—indicated widespread program failure. Further, the court held that\nthe totality of this data conclusively proved that defendants’ failure to effectively\nmonitor LEP programs caused such LEP secondary student failure at the\nground level. We disagree.\n      To begin with, we note that, statewide, the total secondary school LEP\npopulation is only some twenty percent of the total LEP student population.\n      This court does not dispute that secondary LEP student performance data\nis alarming. It is clear that LEP students at all secondary grades are not\nperforming satisfactorily on TAKS, and the performance data indicate\nsignificant achievement gaps as compared to passage rate targets—roughly\nfalling anywhere between a thirty-five to forty-five percent gap in achievement.\nThis court is further concerned that there is little evidence that these gaps are\nsteadily decreasing over time or that secondary LEP students are showing signs\nof steady improvement on standardized tests.\n      But in spite of these real concerns, we find that the district court over-\nemphasized the significance of student achievement scores. As mentioned\npreviously, it is difficult for standardized tests administered in English to\n\n                                         25\n\faccurately capture an LEP student’s knowledge of core curriculum. And, “[i]t is\ninevitable that [LEP] students (who by definition are not yet proficient in\nEnglish) will underperform as compared to native speakers.” Horne, 129 S.Ct.\nat 2603 n. 16. See also Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1014. Last, the system is\nincapable of crediting high-performance by non-native speakers who have\nalready completed the program because they are no longer classified as LEP.22\nThus, it is unsurprising that the achievement scores of secondary LEP students\nillustrate a significant gap in achievement.\n       Further, the district court’s analysis of student achievement data was not\nrestricted to the longitudinal data derived from the PBMAS system. Instead, the\ndistrict court reviewed data over a period of four years, from the 2003–2004\nschool year to the 2006–2007 school year, even though the PBMAS system was\nnot implemented until the 2004–2005 school year, and data from the 2006–2007\nschool year was not in evidence. Thus, only two-years worth of PBMAS data was\nproperly in evidence and before the court.\n       We find this period of time insufficient to show whether defendants’ use\nof PBMAS enables them to effectively monitor LEP programs and ensure EEOA\ncompliance. See Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1010 (explaining that LEP programs\nmust be given a “sufficient” period of time to work). The court failed to analyze\nlongitudinal data provided during the time when PBMAS was in effect; thus, the\ncomparisons made, and conclusions reached in making them, are unreliable.\nHorne, 129 S.Ct. at 2603 n. 16. ( “[An] absence of longitudinal data in the record\n\n\n       22\n          Yearly in every grade (at least at and/or above grade 3) LEP students are tested in\nEnglish language proficiency tests and those who are scored “advanced high” are thereafter\nno longer classified as LEP. Thus, it is virtually inevitable that the higher grades will tend\nto have a lower proportion of students whose natural talent is above average at least in the\nability to learn a language other than that in which they communicated prior to entering\nschool.\n\n                                             26\n\fprecludes useful comparisons.”). Due to PBMAS’s nascent development and the\nabsence of longitudinal data, we find that the district court abused its discretion\nin concluding that the PBMAS system had not achieved satisfactory results.\n      We also take issue with the district court’s conclusion that the “totality of\n[the] data establishes causation.”23 LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 779, 779–80.\nIncluded in the “totality of data” were comparisons of the achievement scores\ndiscussed above as well as drop-out rates, retention rates, and participation\nrates in advanced courses.          For example, the district court found that in\n2003–2004, 2.0% of secondary LEP students dropped out of school, while only\n0.9% of secondary non-LEP students dropped out. The district court also pointed\nout that in 2003–2004, the retention rate of secondary LEP students was 13.8%,\nwhile only 6.3% of non-LEP students were retained.                     And the trial court\ndetermined that LEP students are far less likely to participate in a dual\nenrollment, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate program, e.g.,\nin 2004, 8.5% of LEP students, compared to 19.9% of all students, completed a\n\n\n\n      23\n        The district court held that its previous order erred in reading “extraneous\ncausation” into Castaneda’s three-part test and erroneously determined that aggregate\nstudent performance data, without more, could not evidence the requisite degree of\ncausation:\n\n      “This Court . . . misstated the factual record because Intervenors presented\n      much more than ‘aggregate student performance data.’ Secondary LEP students\n      across the board not only failed to perform at the level of their non-LEP peers\n      on achievement tests, but also dropped out of school at significantly higher\n      rates; had significantly higher retention rates; and remained in LEP programs\n      for four or more years, without making adequate yearly progress. That the\n      Court did not consider the multitude of indicators in its finding of fact was error\n      in itself; that the Court amplified this error by misstating that Intervenors had\n      presented only a paucity of evidence was . . . clear and manifest reversible error\n      . . . . Examining such nebulous factors as social and economic background as\n      potential primary causes of LEP student failure is a task fraught with hazard.”\n\nLULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 773.\n\n                                              27\n\fdual enrollment course.\n      The above comparisons have little significance. First, these comparative\nfactors suffer the same faults as student achievement scores—the data was\ncollected prior to PBMAS implementation, and because the system was\nimplemented only for the 2004-2005 school year, the comparative factors are not\nbased on longitudinal data.     Second, a 1.1% difference in the drop out rate\nbetween LEP and non-LEP students is not significantly probative. And though\nthe retention rates show a more significant gap, it is foreseeable that LEP\nstudents would have greater difficulty in mastering core curriculum while\nsimultaneously trying to achieve English proficiency. Last, the rate of LEP\nsecondary student participation in advanced courses is of little probative\nvalue—it is to be expected that those students still attempting to achieve\nEnglish proficiency are not as likely to take part in advanced courses.\n      More significantly, the totality of the data does not explain how the\n“failure” of LEP students was caused by errors or omissions on the part of TEA.\nTo find a violation of the EEOA, a court must make sufficient findings of fact to\nsupport a conclusion that student failures “stem from [defendants’] failure to\ntake ‘appropriate action.’” Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605. The evidence in this case,\nwhich essentially is only comprised of statewide aggregate student performance\ndata and participation rates, cannot support such a causal connection.\n      Under Texas law the school districts are the ones having “the primary\nresponsibility for implementing the state’s” bilingual and ESL programs, TEX.\nEDUC. CODE § 11.002 (emphasis added), and the boards of trustees of such\ndistricts have “primary responsibility for ensuring the district . . . complies with\nall applicable requirements of state educational programs.” Id. § 7.028(b).\nFurther, each school district determines whether ESL or bilingual programs (or\nother transitional language instruction) are used in the seventh and eighth\n\n                                        28\n\fgrades. Id. § 29.053(d)(2). There is essentially no evidence, findings or analysis\nof the performance of any individual school districts or any groups of districts\n(whether grouped geographically, or by either overall and/or LEP student\npopulation size, or by some socio-economic criteria, or on any other basis), or of\nthe presence or absence or the extent or nature of differences in performance of\nLEP students (or students as a whole), or the nature of the bilingual or ESL\nprograms and the implementation thereof, as between different districts, or\ngroups of districts, or the like.24 There is simply no substantial evidence that\ndiverse implementation deficiencies in numerous different school districts did\nnot primarily cause the poor performance of so many secondary LEP students.\n       Moreover, the district court erred in failing to consider other possible\ncauses for the secondary LEP student failure. See, e.g., note 22, supra. The\ndistrict court did not explore alternative causes because it concluded that\nprimary and secondary LEP students suffer similar socio-economic conditions,\nbut show significantly different levels of achievement; thus, “social and economic\nfactors . . . are not the culprit.” LULAC IV, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 780. The trial\ncourt provided no additional evidence to support its assumption.\n       While we agree that primary and secondary LEP students in a given\nschool district likely exist in similar social and economic situations, we do not\nbelieve they are exposed to the same challenges. For example, the Supreme\nCourt recently recognized that secondary LEP students face a greater number\nof obstacles:\n       “There are many possible causes for the [under-]performance of\n       students in [LEP programs]. These include the difficulty of teaching\n       English to older students (many of whom, presumably, were not in\n\n\n       24\n          Apart from that relating to the percentage rate of parental denials in certain\ndistricts. See opinion below, 572 F. Supp. 2d at 737-38.\n\n                                              29\n\f      English-speaking schools as younger students) and problems, such\n      as drug use and the prevalence of gangs.”\nHorne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605 n. 20.25 Thus, any comparison between LEP and non-\nLEP students “must take into account other variables that may explain [their\ndifferences in achievement]” in order to accurately determine the true cause of\nstudent failure. Id. The district court abused its discretion in failing to address\nother possible causes of student failure.\n      In light of the above errors, we hold that the evidence relied upon by the\ndistrict court does not establish that TEA has failed to take “appropriate action”\nto overcome language barriers nor does it establish that TEA has somehow\nabdicated responsibility in monitoring the secondary LEP program.\nNonetheless, we recognize that LEP student performance is alarming, and we\nencourage the district court and the parties involved to reconsider whether one\nor more individual school districts should be added to this litigation in order for\nit to proceed (with transfer to the proper district and division as appropriate).\nBy adding individual districts, the court can better examine the circumstances\nof specific students, schools, and districts, which will be invaluable evidence for\ndetermining the cause of LEP student failure and how best to remedy it.\n      We do not suggest that state defendants cannot be held liable under the\nEEOA. Instead, we merely hold that an appropriate analysis of an EEOA claim\nshould be conducted with regard to a particular district or districts, with state\neducational agencies serving as additional parties.26\n\n\n      25\n          This court notes that a significant difference between primary and secondary\nstudents is their ability to obtain gainful employment. Secondary students who are able to\nalter their economic position through employment will invariably have less time to devote\nto their studies and may feel added pressure to drop out of school altogether.\n      26\n      Castaneda offers just such an example, where plaintiffs appropriately initiated an\nEEOA action against a local school district and later named the TEA as a defendant. See\n\n                                            30\n\fE. Motion to Modify the Modified Order\n      This court reviews the district court’s order granting in part, and denying\nin part, defendants’ motion to modify the order, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b)(5), for abuse of discretion. Frazar v. Ladd, 457 F.3d 432, 435\n(5th Cir. 2006). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) provides that a party\nmay obtain relief from a court order when “applying it prospectively is no longer\nequitable.” The party seeking to modify an injunction bears the burden of\nestablishing that a significant change in factual conditions or the law warrants\nrevision of the injunction. See Rufo v. Inmates of the Suffolk County Jail, 502\nU.S. 367, 383–84 (1992).\n      Defendants argue that this court’s decision in Samnorwood Independent\nSchool District v. Texas Education Agency, 533 F.3d 258 (5th Cir. 2008),\nconstitutes a significant change in the law and requires this court to limit the\nreach of the Modified Order to the nine all-black school district defendants in the\noriginal lawsuit.    In Samnorwood, two school districts that voluntarily\ndesegregated in the 1960s and were not party to the original 1970 litigation\nchallenged whether the Modified Order could be appropriately applied to them.\nThis court held as follows:\n      “[T]he prophylactic provisions created by the Modified Order to\n      remedy the segregative conduct on the part of TEA and all-black\n      schools in East Texas should not be imposed on these two panhandle\n      school districts that had long previously already desegregated and\n      have never since been found to have acted with segregative intent.”\nId. at 269. Central to the court’s analysis was the fact that there had been no\nshowing of a constitutional violation by the school districts themselves, and “the\nmodified order and TEA’s actions pursuant to it constitute a remedy that must\n\n\n\n648 F.2d at 992.\n\n                                        31\n\fflow from a constitutional violation.” Id. at 268, 267–68.\n       The trial court read Samnorwood very narrowly, determining that this\nCourt’s decision was largely based on the fact that the two school districts\ninvolved had been unitary prior to the implementation of the Modified Order.\nLULAC V, 2008 WL 5334404 at *5. Ultimately, the district court modified the\norder in a very restrictive manner, exempting only those districts situated\nalmost identically to the Samnorwood districts. We find that this modification\nwas overly restrictive.\n       The Modified Order was issued for the purpose of eliminating the diverse\ncontinued local practices and vestiges of de jure racially segregated public\neducation.27 Since its issuance, nearly forty years have elapsed, and “the racial\ncomposition of public schools in Texas has changed drastically.” See United\nStates v. Texas, 457 F.3d 472, 475 (5th Cir. 2006).                 And while this court\nrecognizes that some local vestiges of discrimination and segregation might still\nremain, it is clear that the Modified Order certainly has, at best, “dwindling\nrelevance.” Id.\n       In light of the above, and this court’s supervisory powers, we hold that the\nModified Order’s reach should be further limited. Related concerns led us to\nmodify the original order on direct appeal to provide that “[no]thing herein shall\nbe deemed to affect the jurisdiction of any other district court with respect to any\npresently pending or future school desegregation suits.” United States v. Texas,\n\n\n\n       27\n         This court, of course, recognizes that de jure racial discrimination existed in Texas.\nWe also note that in 1955 the Texas Supreme Court declared invalid, under the United\nStates Constitution, the provisions of the Texas Constitution and statutes requiring school\nracial segregation, McKinney v. Blankenship, 282 S.W.2d 691, 695 (Tex. 1955), and that in\n1969, the Texas Legislature formally repealed all of the State’s segregation laws. Acts\n1969, 61st Leg., p. 3230, H.J.R. 3. Thus, the original 1970 litigation was brought at a time\nwhen segregation was invalid under both federal and state law.\n\n                                              32\n\f447 F.2d 441, 442 (5th Cir. 1971). See also, e.g., United States v. Texas, 466 F.2d\n518, 519 (5th Cir. 1972) (transferring case as to San Felipe Del Rio School\nDistrict to Western District of Texas). Time has shown that further restriction\nof the modified order’s scope is necessary and appropriate.                         See, e.g.,\nSamnorwood, 533 F.3d at 269; Gregory-Portland, 654 F.2d at 993-94. The\ndistrict court was correct to exempt school districts similarly situated to the\nSamnorwood districts. In addition, we find that the same modification must be\nmade for local school districts declared unitary in federal cases; school districts\ncurrently under federal court desegregation orders or decrees or which are\nparties to pending federal court desegregation suits; and any other specific\nschool district not a party to the case when the Modified Order was issued which\nrequests, or for which the State requests, exemption from the Modified Order\nunless a plaintiff shows the district is not then unitary. As to such districts\nthat are thus now or subsequently exempted from the Modified Order, the\ndistrict court may no longer direct TEA with regard to such districts pursuant\nto its remedial jurisdiction over the Modified Order.28\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n       We hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding that\ndefendants’ violated Section G of the Modified Order because there was no\nsufficient evidence or finding of statewide de jure segregation against Mexican-\nAmericans. We also hold that the district court abused its discretion in holding\nthat defendants violated Section 1703(f) of the EEOA because the evidence\npresented does not establish that a student’s right has been violated or that\ndefendants’ acts or omissions caused any claimed violation. On remand, we\n\n\n\n       28\n         And such districts shall no longer be subject to the district court’s continuing\njurisdiction under the Modified Order.\n\n                                              33\n\finstruct the court below to reconsider whether local school districts should be\nadded to this action, and upon the inclusion of a local school district, we instruct\nthe court below to reconsider whether it constitutes an “appropriate district\ncourt” for jurisdictional purposes, or if, instead, the litigation should proceed in\na different forum appropriate to such school districts under normal venue\nprinciples.\n                         REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\f",

PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       This appeal arises out of litigation with a long and complex procedural\nhistory. It is an offshoot of a suit originally filed in 1970 in the Eastern District\nof Texas by plaintiff-appellee, the United States, against defendants concerning\nnine all-black school districts located in northeastern Texas. The suit resulted\nin the district court’s issuance of the July 1971 Modified Order, a permanent\ninjunctive order that provided for the district court to supervise broad aspects\nof the State’s educational system and policies.1\n       The Modified Order contains a number of provisions. Pertinent to the\nmerits of this case is Section G, entitled “Curriculum and Compensatory\nEducation.” Section G is comprised of two subsections. The first, Section G(1),\ncontains broad language, providing that: “Defendants shall insure that school\ndistricts are providing equal educational opportunities in all schools.” Section\nG(2) is more specific and requires TEA to conduct a study of the educational\nneeds of minority children throughout the entire state and report its findings to\nthe district court.2\n\n\n       1\n          The district court’s original order was modified by this court on appeal, hence its\ntitle, “the Modified Order.” See United States v.

TRIAL COURT’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS\nBackground\n      Chapter 29 of the Texas Education Code mandates bilingual education and\nEnglish as a second language (“ESL”) programs in all Texas schools. TEX. EDUC.\nCODE § 29.051. Bilingual programs are offered in kindergarten through sixth\ngrade (primary education), while ESL programs are offered in seventh through\ntwelfth grade (secondary education). LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 736.\nHowever, local school districts may elect either bilingual or ESL programs “or\nother transitional language instruction” for the seventh and eighth grade LEP\nstudents. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 29.053(d)(2).7 These programs are significantly\ndifferent; bilingual instruction teaches course materials in both English and the\nstudent’s native language, while ESL instruction teaches materials in modified\nEnglish for easier comprehension by LEP students. LULAC IV, 572 F.2d at 735.\n\n\n      7\n          In the years in evidence, apparently all used ESL.\n\n                                               7\n\fStudents’ participation in bilingual and ESL programs is subject to parental\npermission, which may be, and sometimes is, withheld.\n      Under the Texas Education Code, “[t]he school districts and charter\nschools created in accordance with the laws of this state have the primary\nresponsibility for implementing the state’s system of public education and\nensuring student performance in accordance with this code.” TEX. EDUC. CODE\n§ 11.002. And, “[a]n educational function not specifically delegated to [TEA] is\nreserved to and shall be performed by school districts or open-enrollment charter\nschools.” Id. § 7.003. Under Section 7.021(b), TEA is given diverse powers to\n“administer and monitor compliance.” TEA is given certain authority respecting\nmonitoring compliance with various programs, including the state bilingual\neducation and ESL programs. Id. §§ 29.051-29.064. Under Section 7.028(a),\nsuch compliance monitoring function extends “only as necessary to ensure . . .\ncompliance with federal law and regulations” (and financial integrity and certain\n“data integrity”); and under section 7.028(b), “[t]he board of trustees of a school\ndistrict or the governing body of an open-enrollment charter school has primary\nresponsibility for ensuring that the district or school complies with all applicable\nrequirements of state educational programs.” TEA is required to “evaluate the\neffectiveness of [bilingual and ESL] programs” as “compared to state established\nstandards.” Id. §§ 29.062(a), 39.053(c). Factors to be considered include, among\nother things, drop-out rates, graduation rates, and standardized test passing\nrates. Id. § 39.053(c).\n      In 2003, the TEA’s previous monitoring program to evaluate program\ncompliance was replaced with the Performance Based Monitoring Analysis\nSystem (PBMAS). PBMAS was first implemented in the 2004–2005 school year.\nAnnually, the PBMAS generates a set of performance indicators on the district-\nlevel, based mostly on student passage rates on the Texas Assessment of\n\n                                         8\n\fKnowledge and Skills (TAKS), a statewide achievement test. Each year the\nstate sets standards for student passage rates in five subject areas and compares\ndistricts' performance to these standards. TEA assigns each district a\nperformance level based upon the deviation of the district's passage rates from\nthe state established standards. And a district’s performance level determines\nwhether the district will be subject to intervention and to what degree. In terms\nof LEP students, PBMAS evaluates the bilingual and ESL program using TAKS\nscores of LEP students, as well as other indicators, including the LEP annual\ndrop-out rate, the LEP graduation rate, and LEP reading proficiency. At the\ntime of the trial court’s evidentiary hearing, only two years’ worth of PBMAS\ndata was available—the 2004–2005 school year and the 2005–2006 school year.\nProblems With PBMAS\n      The district court identified two overall problems with TEA’s monitoring\nprocedures: (1) the kind of data collected by PBMAS inaccurately reflects how\nwell a district is performing and cannot adequately detect deficiencies at the\ncampus level; and (2) TEA’s inadequate response to problems flagged by PBMAS\ncontributes to the denial of educational opportunity.\n      In particular, the court determined that data collected by PBMAS show\nthat some school districts are likely under-reporting the number of LEP\nstudents, and TEA has done nothing to verify these numbers. The court also\nfound that although TEA compared the bilingual-ESL indicators to state\nstandards for all students, TEA has no procedure for comparing the performance\nof LEP students to non-LEP students directly. The court further found that\nPBMAS’s aggregation of scores for multiple grade levels as well as for entire\nschool districts distorted the performance indicators and masked problems at\nspecific schools.\n      With respect to on-site visits, the court determined that TEA had not\n\n                                       9\n\fconducted any on-site monitoring for some years and had no bilingual-ESL\ncertified monitors at the time of the trial. The court also considered other ways\nTEA monitors LEP students, such as monitoring that it performs under the No\nChild Left Behind (NCLB) program and the Texas accountability rating system.\nThe court found that, although some of these monitoring programs disaggregate\nstudent performance data, they do not overcome the deficiencies in PBMAS\nbecause they do not target all relevant criteria for evaluating LEP students.\nAchievement Of LEP Students\n       The district court also found that too high a proportion of the statewide\nsecondary LEP student population were failing. At all grade levels and in all\nsubject areas, secondary LEP students are performing poorly on TAKS. In fact,\nsecondary LEP students have much lower passage rates on standardized tests\nthan the general student body—creating a significant gap in achievement that\nranges (roughly) between thirty-five and forty-five percentage points.                  Also,\nsecondary LEP students have higher retention and drop-out rates when\ncompared to the general student population. “LEP students fail to progress\nthrough or exit LEP programs in a reasonable time.” LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

And LEP students participate in advanced courses at a “far lower\nrate than all students.”8 Id. at 752.\n       The trial court made no finding or determination that with respect to\nprimary grades (kindergarten through sixth grade) the defendants had violated\nSection 1703(f).\n                                   III. DISCUSSION\nA.

We disagree.\n      28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) provides this court with jurisdiction over\n“[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States . . . granting,\ncontinuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve\nor modify injunctions.” The trial court ordered that defendants “establish a\nmonitoring system and establish a language program that fulfill the\nrequirements of the Equal Education Opportunity Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f)” for\nthe 2009–2010 academic year and thereafter. The LEP order also requires\ndefendants to “submit a monitoring plan addressing the failures of PBMAS and\nto submit a proposed new language program for secondary LEP students by\nJanuary 31, 2009, or earlier.” Id. We find these instructions to be sufficiently\ncoercive to constitute a mandatory injunction appealable under Section\n1292(a)(1). See Morales v. Turman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335448\"><a href=\"/opinion/335448/alicia-morales-v-james-a-turman-individually-and-in-his-official/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 n.6 (5th Cir. 1976), rev’d\non other grounds, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109619\"><a href=\"/opinion/109619/morales-v-turman/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Devising a new\nmonitoring system and secondary LEP language program for all of these\ndistricts would require extraordinary effort. Defendants would not only be\nforced to address a wide variety of concerns, e.g., funding, staffing, and even\ntheir own legislative authority to create and carry out such a plan, they would\nalso need to implement substantial changes systemwide in a very short period\nof time.\n      Because the district court’s order compels defendants to promptly and\n\n                                        11\n\faffirmatively act in a specific and extremely extensive manner, the order\nconstitutes a mandatory injunction over which this court may assert its\nappellate jurisdiction.\nB.

In granting intervenors’ motion to alter\nthe judgment, the district court held that defendants violated both the Modified\nOrder and the EEOA. Thus, this court must independently review both holdings\nfor abuse of discretion.\nC. Section G of the Modified Order\n      The district court retained remedial jurisdiction over all actions brought\nto enforce or amend the Modified Order. Modified Order, Section J. Intervenors\nseek to enforce the Modified Order by invoking the broad language of Section\nG(1), which requires defendants to “insure that school districts are providing\nequal educational opportunities in all schools.” Id. at Section G. Thus, the\ndistrict court appropriately asserted jurisdiction over intervenors’ claim. After\nreviewing the evidence, the district court held that defendants violated Section\nG because PBMAS’s flaws were so significant that defendants could not\neffectively insure that LEP students received equal educational opportunities in\nTexas public schools. We conclude that this holding was in error.\n      “The Modified Order directs Defendants to take affirmative steps to\neliminate all remaining vestiges of the former de jure segregated school system\n\n                                        12\n\fin Texas, to prevent the recurrence of a segregated system, and to achieve fully\nintegrated schools.” LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Thus, to find a violation\nof the Modified Order, the trial court must determine that the contested action\n“represents or flows” from a de jure segregated or discriminatory system. As\ndefendants are state actors and the trial court ordered a statewide remedy, the\ndecision below cannot be upheld absent a showing of statewide de jure\nsegregation of Mexican-Americans.\n       This court has repeatedly acknowledged the historical and statewide de\njure segregation of black and white students in Texas, but has held that at no\ntime “ha[s] Texas segregated Anglo students from Mexican-American ones by\nlaw.” United States v. Gregory Portland Independent School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392671\"><a href=\"/opinion/392671/united-states-v-gregory-portland-independent-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 992 (5th Cir. 1981). Nor is the trial court entitled to presume such\nstatewide de jure segregation absent an evidentiary hearing. See id. at 998. The\ntrial court made no factual findings with regard to statewide de jure segregation\nof Mexican-Americans,9 nor would the record here support such a finding.\n\n\n       9\n        The trial court did state that: “this Court has already found [in the 1981\nintervention], and the Fifth Circuit has upheld, that TEA and the State of Texas [were]\ninvolved in intentional discrimination against Spanish speaking Mexican-American\nstudents [in the past].” LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district\ncourt also ignored this court’s determination in Gregory-Portland that no such system\nexisted. 654 F.2d at 992. Thus, the lower court erred in concluding that Mexican-\nAmericans suffered statewide de jure discrimination in the past (although the court\ndisclaimed basing its presently challenged orders on any such determination, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

In determining whether it had jurisdiction, the trial court\nreasoned that, because intervenors’ claims were a continuation of the 1981\nintervention under the Modified Order, the “instant action [was] a successive\nmotion . . . lineally descending from the Fifth Circuit’s remand in [1982].”\nLULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. at\n410.   There, the trial court held that Section G only required defendants to\nconduct a study and file a report proposing remedial programs for, among other\nthings, curricular offerings for students who primarily spoke a language other\nthan English. Id. at 411. And intervenors’ Section G claim was denied because\nTEA timely satisfied this obligation.10 Id. at 411.\n       It is unclear to this court how intervenors’ claim could be a successive\nmotion when the original claim was previously denied. And even if, as the trial\ncourt suggests, intervenors raised new facts suggesting a violation of Section G’s\nbroader principle of equal educational opportunities, there has been no finding\nof statewide de jure segregation of Mexican-Americans in Texas. Thus, the lower\ncourt erred in finding that intervenors could establish a Section G violation, and\n\n\n2d at 758).\n       10\n         The trial court addressed this apparent contradiction between the present order on\nappeal and the original 1981 order, reasoning that “it is abundantly clear that [it] was\nreferring to Section G(2), and therefore did not hold that Section G(1) [sic], which has\nnothing to do with the reporting requirement, was complied with by virtue of filing the\nreport.”\n\n                                            14\n\fthe district court should not have exercised jurisdiction over intervenors’\nsupplemental EEOA claim pursuant to its remedial jurisdiction over the\nModified Order.\n      Because intervenors’ Section G claim was invalid pursuant to the district\ncourt’s own order in 1981 and Fifth Circuit precedent, we hold that intervenors’\nSection G and EEOA claims should have been severed into entirely separate\nlawsuits.\nD. Equal Educational Opportunities Act\n      1. Absence of Local Districts\n      The district court’s finding of an EEOA violation is unreliable because the\ndistrict court failed to adequately address this circuit’s 1982 remand\ninstructions. In 1982, this court questioned whether intervenors’ EEOA claim\ncould be appropriately addressed absent local school districts as parties.\nSpecifically, we concluded that “there exists little if any practical or logical\njustification for attempting to deal on a statewide basis with the problems\npresented by this case.” LULAC II, 680 F.2d at 373–74. See also note 4, supra.\nAnd we remanded the action to the district court with the following instructions:\n      “[T]he language problems to be met will necessarily vary by district\n      . . . . [W]hether the effect of a local language program,\n      state-mandated or not, constitutes appropriate action to deal with\n      language barriers faced by the students of a given school district\n      will of necessity be an essentially local question. . . . We fail to see\n      how [a question of Section 1703(f) compliance] can be properly\n      resolved in the absence of the school district concerned or how [it]\n      can effectively be dealt with on a statewide basis. . . . [W]e therefore\n      direct the district court to determine . . . what questions—if\n      any—presented by the case are subject to resolution on a statewide\n      basis before proceeding further on the remand that we mandate.”\nId. at 374.\n      In light of this court’s analysis of the evidence below, we conclude that the\n\n                                        15\n\fissues raised by intervenors’ EEOA claim have not been properly addressed in\nthe absence of individual school districts as parties.\n      This court notes that intervenors identified fourteen LULAC members who\nwere parents of one or more LEP students. Those parents represent, in total,\ntwenty LEP students attending schools within three individual school districts.\nSee also note 5, supra. Not one of these school districts is named as a party to\nthis action or located within the Eastern District of Texas.\n      Further, because no school district is a party to the present litigation, the\nissue remains as to whether the district court constitutes an “appropriate\ndistrict court” capable of asserting jurisdiction over intervenors’ claim. See 20\nU.S.C. § 1708 (“The appropriate district court of the United States shall have\nand exercise jurisdiction of proceedings instituted under [this statute].”\n(emphasis added)).      The district court improperly relied on its remedial\njurisdiction under the Modified Order to assert jurisdiction over intervenors’\nsupplemental EEOA claim; thus, it failed to adequately address whether it\nconstituted an “appropriate district court” pursuant to Section 1708. Congress\ndid not define “appropriate district court” in the statute, and there is little\nlegislative history or judicial precedent on the issue.\n      We conclude that “an appropriate district court” is normally the district\ncourt in which a local school district, as a party to the action, is located. And\nonce one or more local districts are added as parties in this litigation, the district\ncourt should reconsider whether it constitutes an “appropriate district court” for\njurisdictional purposes or if the case should, instead, be handled in a forum that\nconstitutes a proper venue for such additional parties.\n      2. The Evidence Presented Below\n      This court’s decision regarding the necessity of a local school district is\nfurther supported because the record below is insufficient to uphold the trial\n\n                                         16\n\fcourt’s finding of an EEOA violation. To find a violation of, and order a remedy\nunder, the EEOA, intervenors must establish (1) a violation of a student’s rights\nunder the EEOA, (2) that the violation “stem[med] from a failure to take\n‘appropriate action’” on the part of the defendants, Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605, and\n(3) that any remedial order is “essential to correct [the] particular denials” of\nEEOA rights found. 20 U.S.C. § 1712. We conclude that intervenors failed to\nmake the requisite showing.\n       Under the EEOA, a state may not “deny equal educational opportunity to\nan individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or national origin, by . . .\nthe failure by an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome\nlanguage barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its\ninstructional programs.” 20 U.S.C. § 1703(f) (emphasis added). Both state and\nlocal educational agencies are responsible for taking “appropriate action” under\nthe statute,11 but the EEOA “leave[s] state and local educational authorities a\nsubstantial amount of latitude in choosing the program and techniques they\nwould use to meet their obligations under the EEOA.” Castaneda v.

Under this system, local school districts are primarily\nresponsible for the implementation of LEP programs, while TEA is responsible\nfor ensuring compliance with federal and state law and evaluating and\nmonitoring the effectiveness of LEP programs.             TEX. EDUC. CODE §§ 7.003,\n7.021(b)(1), 7.028, 11.002, 29.062. Thus, defendants’ liability under the EEOA\nis dependent upon the extent to which they have failed to take “appropriate\naction” in fulfilling their legal responsibilities under state law – which in this\ncase requires that they monitor and evaluate LEP programs via PBMAS – which\nfailure has caused a deprivation of the rights of Mexican-American LEP students\nunder Section 1703(f).\n       To determine the appropriateness of an educational agency’s action, this\ncourt has instituted a three-prong test: (1) whether the program is based on\nsound educational theory, (2) whether reasonable efforts are being made to\nimplement the theory (implementation prong), and (3) whether the program,\nover a legitimate period of time, has achieved some success in overcoming\nlanguage barriers (results prong). Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1009–10. After\n\n\n\n       12\n          Moreover, while the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) does not replace\nSection 1703(f) (and compliance with the former does not necessarily constitute compliance\nwith the latter), nevertheless, as Horne states:\n        “NCLB marked a dramatic shift in federal education policy. It reflects\n        Congress’ judgment that the best way to raise the level of education\n        nationwide is by granting state and local officials flexibility to develop and\n        implement educational programs that address local needs, while holding\n        them accountable for the results. . . . NCLB conditions the continued receipt\n        of funds on demonstrations of ‘adequate yearly progress.’” Id. at 2601.\nTitle III of NCLB specifically focuses on LEP students and their acquisition of English\nlanguage proficiency. Id.\n\n                                            18\n\fapplying the above analysis, the district court concluded that defendants’ use of\nPBMAS in its current form fails both the implementation prong and the results\nprong.13\n       The district court’s ruling that a given defendant has or has not taken the\n“appropriate action” required of it under section 1703(f) presents “a mixed\nquestion of fact and law,” review of which requires us to determine whether the\ntrial court’s “conclusion was adequately supported by subsidiary findings of fact\nwhich do not appear clearly erroneous.” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1010.

LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 765. The trial court\nidentified a variety of “flaws” that rendered the system ineffective: (1) the\nabsence of equality based comparisons, (2) under-identification of LEP students,\nand (3) the aggregation of data at the district level.\n                   1. Equality Based Comparisons\n      First, the trial court determined that PBMAS was flawed because it did\nnot make equality based comparisons between LEP and non-LEP students.\nData collected under PBMAS compares LEP student achievement to state\nassigned target passage rates; a district’s deviation from state targets\ndetermines its performance level, which in turn determines whether and to what\ndegree TEA will intervene. Thus, PBMAS does not directly compare LEP\nstudent achievement with non-LEP student achievement, and absent such a\ndirect comparison, the district court concluded that the program could not\nadequately monitor the effectiveness of LEP programs.        The only basis the\ndistrict court provided for this conclusion was that the EEOA is an equality\nbased statute.\n      Federal law provides no instruction as to how states should analyze LEP\nstudent achievement. But the Supreme Court did recently hold that “the EEOA\nrequires ‘appropriate action’ to remove language barriers, § 1703(f), not the\nequalization of results between native and nonnative speakers on tests\nadministered in English.”      Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605.     And by state law,\ndefendants are only required to “evaluate the effectiveness of [bilingual and\n\n                                        20\n\fESL] programs” as “compared to state-established standards.” TEX. EDUC. CODE\n§§ 29.062(a), 39.053(b). We do not believe that EEOA compliance requires the\ncomparisons insisted on by the district court.\n      Further, reasonable minds could differ over what comparative method is\nmost effective to determine whether language barriers are being overcome. The\nState of Texas and the TEA have determined that success is best measured by\ndetermining whether LEP students are achieving state-passage rate targets, and\nthere is no evidence that the district court’s preferred method of comparison is\nbetter than that of the State’s.\n      In fact, the district court’s method comes with significant faults. For\nexample, standardized tests are administered to secondary LEP students in\nEnglish, a language in which they, by definition, lack proficiency. Horne, 129\nS.Ct. at 2603 n.16; Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1014. English administration makes\nit difficult for test results to accurately capture an LEP student’s knowledge of\ncore curriculum, and it is inevitable that such students will not perform as well\nas non-LEP students. Also, once an LEP student has successfully completed a\nlanguage remediation program, he or she is no longer identified as LEP,\nrendering it impossible for a direct comparison to adequately capture program\nsuccesses. Thus, a direct comparison between LEP and non-LEP students may\nnot adequately represent the actual achievement gap between the two groups.\nAnd, by making equality a priority, districts with a significant gap in passage\nrates will require intervention regardless of how high LEP student scores might\nbe, whereas no intervention will occur in districts where LEP and non-LEP\nstudents have lower, but reasonably equivalent, scores.\n      The district court failed to adequately acknowledge any of the above\ncriticisms and, instead, abused its discretion by supplanting defendants’\neducational policy decision with its own judgment.        Moreover, there is no\n\n                                       21\n\fevidence that any such method of comparison deficiency caused any deprivation\nof the Section 1703(f) rights of Mexican-American LEP students.\n                      2. Under-identification of LEP Students\n       The district court also determined that school districts are “likely” under-\nidentifying LEP students. LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 767–68. TEA is tasked\nwith establishing criteria for identification, assessment, and classification of\nLEP students. TEX. EDUC. CODE § 29.056(a).

However, parents may, and sometimes do, deny consent.\n       At trial, intervenors presented evidence that, while the state average of\nparental denials is 4.9%, some districts have reported a significantly higher\npercentage of denials.16 Based on this evidence, the trial court determined that\nthose districts must be under-identifying LEP students, and this under-\nidentification decreases the perceived achievement gap between LEP and non-\nLEP students. LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 767–68.\n       We find that the district court reached this conclusion in error. The\ndistrict court based its conclusion on the belief that a parental denial altered the\nidentification of the student, so that the child is no longer characterized as LEP.\n\n       16\n          Intervenors also presented evidence that some districts report a significantly lower\npercentage of LEP students than the county-wide percentage of households in which a\nlanguage other than English is spoken. To the extent that the district court based its\nfinding of under-identification on this evidence, we find that this conclusion was in error.\nThe percentage of households in which a language other than English is spoken does not in\nany meaningful way evidence the number of LEP students residing within the county.\n        The district court also observed “it appears that in at least some of these schools [in\ndistricts with high rates of parental denials], parents may not be well informed of the\nadvantages of bilingual-ESL programs or may be subject of coercion” (emphasis added).\nThere is no substantial evidence of instances of any such “coercion” (or misinformation),\nand in any event the above quoted observations are entirely too vague and speculative to\nform any valid basis for relief against defendants. Finally, there is no substantial evidence\nof any default by defendants in performance of their duties in this respect causing Mexican-\nAmerican LEP students’ loss of their § 1703(f) rights.\n\n                                              22\n\fId. at 767–68. This conclusion is entirely incorrect—once students are identified\nas LEP, they remain identified as such until they obtain English proficiency,\nregardless of participation in the program. Thus, the district court abused its\ndiscretion in determining that the PBMAS data was unreliable due to the under-\nidentification of LEP students.\n                     3. Aggregation of Data\n       The district court also took issue with the PBMAS monitoring system’s\naggregation of data at the district level.17 Id. at 768. The district court held that\nthis comparative method prevents intervention on individual campuses that are\nnot performing as well as the district overall. In reaching this conclusion, the\ncourt relied upon a study which showed that 277 schools, attended by a total of\n54,963 LEP students, performed at a performance level lower than the stage of\nintervention required by the district’s assigned performance level.18 However,\nthis study did not ascertain the total number of campuses in need of intervention\nor the total number of campuses subject to intervention based on the district-\nwide data. Thus, it did not provide what percentage of campuses in need of\nintervention or subject to intervention these 277 campuses actually represented.\n       Rather than questioning the significance of the report, the trial court\nperfunctorily concluded that aggregation of data at the district level rendered\nthe PBMAS monitoring system ineffective. Further, the trial court determined\n\n\n       17\n         The trial court also disapproved of TEA’s aggregation of TAKS subject data across\nmultiple grade levels. Defendants explained that TAKS subjects are not annually\nadministered at each grade level; thus, to determine achievement in specific subjects,\nTAKS scores for each subject are combined across the grade levels in which the subject test\nwas administered. The district court held that this allowed the scores of successful primary\nstudents to overinflate the success of the entire group, thus masking the underperformance\nof secondary LEP students.\n       18\n       These numbers represent only 3.4% of campuses within the state and 7.7% of the\nLEP student population.\n\n                                            23\n\fthat it would be more reasonable for TEA to analyze data at the campus level to\navoid this “masking effect.”19 This conclusion ignores the allocation of shared\nresponsibilities within the Texas education system. Under Texas’s system, local\ndistricts are primarily responsible for implementing LEP programs, and\naddressing and remedying under-performing campuses within their own district.\nOn the other hand, TEA is responsible for intervening in failing districts to\nensure overall compliance.20\n       There is no finding nor sufficient evidence that individual districts are\nignoring LEP under-performance on individual campuses or sufficient evidence\nof resulting actual harm to such campuses and their students. We accordingly\nfind that the district court abused its discretion in supplanting defendants’ policy\nchoice with its own preferred method of comparison.21\n       On remand, the district court should reconsider the evidence, in light of\nthis court’s opinion, to properly determine whether PBMAS, coupled with other\nsources of information (such as NCLB), is capable of effectively monitoring the\nsuccess of LEP programs and whether any such monitoring deficiencies of\ndefendants (together with any others so found) amount to a failure to take\n\n       19\n        The district court felt a campus-level analysis was reasonable because TEA\nalready collects both district-wide and campus data.\n       20\n        In holding that the evidence adduced thus far fails to establish that the PBMAS\nmonitoring system does not discharge the State’s responsibilities under the EEOA, we do\nnot necessarily foreclose a finding upon more factual development that district-wide\nmonitoring may be inappropriate for larger school districts because of its potential for\nmasking the deficiencies on individual campuses (nor do we now give either legal blessing\nor condemnation to any such finding on further factual development).\n       21\n         The district court also explained that defendants should monitor at the campus\nlevel because the Modified Order was originally purposed to remedy segregation on the\ncampus level and Section G requires that equal opportunities be provided in “all schools.”\nTo the extent the trial court relied in any way on the Modified Order to reach the above\nconclusions, we find it committed error because there has been no showing of statewide de\njure segregation against Mexican-Americans.\n\n                                            24\n\fappropriate action under Section 1703(f) which caused a denial of the rights of\nMexican-American LEP students thereunder.\n             b. Results Prong\n      Under the results prong, this court must determine whether defendants’\nprogram, “after being employed for a period of time sufficient to give the plan a\nlegitimate trial, [failed] to produce results indicating that the language barriers\nconfronting students are actually being overcome,” and thus, “no longer\nconstitute[s] appropriate action.” Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1010. Under this\nprong, the district court determined that the evidence presented—including\ndrop-out rates, retention rates, and the achievement scores of LEP secondary\nstudents—indicated widespread program failure. Further, the court held that\nthe totality of this data conclusively proved that defendants’ failure to effectively\nmonitor LEP programs caused such LEP secondary student failure at the\nground level. We disagree.\n      To begin with, we note that, statewide, the total secondary school LEP\npopulation is only some twenty percent of the total LEP student population.\n      This court does not dispute that secondary LEP student performance data\nis alarming. It is clear that LEP students at all secondary grades are not\nperforming satisfactorily on TAKS, and the performance data indicate\nsignificant achievement gaps as compared to passage rate targets—roughly\nfalling anywhere between a thirty-five to forty-five percent gap in achievement.\nThis court is further concerned that there is little evidence that these gaps are\nsteadily decreasing over time or that secondary LEP students are showing signs\nof steady improvement on standardized tests.\n      But in spite of these real concerns, we find that the district court over-\nemphasized the significance of student achievement scores. As mentioned\npreviously, it is difficult for standardized tests administered in English to\n\n                                         25\n\faccurately capture an LEP student’s knowledge of core curriculum. And, “[i]t is\ninevitable that [LEP] students (who by definition are not yet proficient in\nEnglish) will underperform as compared to native speakers.” Horne, 129 S.Ct.\nat 2603 n. 16. See also Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1014. Last, the system is\nincapable of crediting high-performance by non-native speakers who have\nalready completed the program because they are no longer classified as LEP.22\nThus, it is unsurprising that the achievement scores of secondary LEP students\nillustrate a significant gap in achievement.\n       Further, the district court’s analysis of student achievement data was not\nrestricted to the longitudinal data derived from the PBMAS system. Instead, the\ndistrict court reviewed data over a period of four years, from the 2003–2004\nschool year to the 2006–2007 school year, even though the PBMAS system was\nnot implemented until the 2004–2005 school year, and data from the 2006–2007\nschool year was not in evidence. Thus, only two-years worth of PBMAS data was\nproperly in evidence and before the court.\n       We find this period of time insufficient to show whether defendants’ use\nof PBMAS enables them to effectively monitor LEP programs and ensure EEOA\ncompliance. See Castaneda, 648 F.2d at 1010 (explaining that LEP programs\nmust be given a “sufficient” period of time to work). The court failed to analyze\nlongitudinal data provided during the time when PBMAS was in effect; thus, the\ncomparisons made, and conclusions reached in making them, are unreliable.\nHorne, 129 S.Ct. at 2603 n. 16. ( “[An] absence of longitudinal data in the record\n\n\n       22\n          Yearly in every grade (at least at and/or above grade 3) LEP students are tested in\nEnglish language proficiency tests and those who are scored “advanced high” are thereafter\nno longer classified as LEP. Thus, it is virtually inevitable that the higher grades will tend\nto have a lower proportion of students whose natural talent is above average at least in the\nability to learn a language other than that in which they communicated prior to entering\nschool.\n\n                                             26\n\fprecludes useful comparisons.”). Due to PBMAS’s nascent development and the\nabsence of longitudinal data, we find that the district court abused its discretion\nin concluding that the PBMAS system had not achieved satisfactory results.\n      We also take issue with the district court’s conclusion that the “totality of\n[the] data establishes causation.”23 LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 779, 779–80.\nIncluded in the “totality of data” were comparisons of the achievement scores\ndiscussed above as well as drop-out rates, retention rates, and participation\nrates in advanced courses.          For example, the district court found that in\n2003–2004, 2.0% of secondary LEP students dropped out of school, while only\n0.9% of secondary non-LEP students dropped out. The district court also pointed\nout that in 2003–2004, the retention rate of secondary LEP students was 13.8%,\nwhile only 6.3% of non-LEP students were retained.                     And the trial court\ndetermined that LEP students are far less likely to participate in a dual\nenrollment, advanced placement, or international baccalaureate program, e.g.,\nin 2004, 8.5% of LEP students, compared to 19.9% of all students, completed a\n\n\n\n      23\n        The district court held that its previous order erred in reading “extraneous\ncausation” into Castaneda’s three-part test and erroneously determined that aggregate\nstudent performance data, without more, could not evidence the requisite degree of\ncausation:\n\n      “This Court . . . misstated the factual record because Intervenors presented\n      much more than ‘aggregate student performance data.’ Secondary LEP students\n      across the board not only failed to perform at the level of their non-LEP peers\n      on achievement tests, but also dropped out of school at significantly higher\n      rates; had significantly higher retention rates; and remained in LEP programs\n      for four or more years, without making adequate yearly progress. That the\n      Court did not consider the multitude of indicators in its finding of fact was error\n      in itself; that the Court amplified this error by misstating that Intervenors had\n      presented only a paucity of evidence was . . . clear and manifest reversible error\n      . . . . Examining such nebulous factors as social and economic background as\n      potential primary causes of LEP student failure is a task fraught with hazard.”\n\nLULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 773.\n\n                                              27\n\fdual enrollment course.\n      The above comparisons have little significance. First, these comparative\nfactors suffer the same faults as student achievement scores—the data was\ncollected prior to PBMAS implementation, and because the system was\nimplemented only for the 2004-2005 school year, the comparative factors are not\nbased on longitudinal data.     Second, a 1.1% difference in the drop out rate\nbetween LEP and non-LEP students is not significantly probative. And though\nthe retention rates show a more significant gap, it is foreseeable that LEP\nstudents would have greater difficulty in mastering core curriculum while\nsimultaneously trying to achieve English proficiency. Last, the rate of LEP\nsecondary student participation in advanced courses is of little probative\nvalue—it is to be expected that those students still attempting to achieve\nEnglish proficiency are not as likely to take part in advanced courses.\n      More significantly, the totality of the data does not explain how the\n“failure” of LEP students was caused by errors or omissions on the part of TEA.\nTo find a violation of the EEOA, a court must make sufficient findings of fact to\nsupport a conclusion that student failures “stem from [defendants’] failure to\ntake ‘appropriate action.’” Horne, 129 S.Ct. at 2605. The evidence in this case,\nwhich essentially is only comprised of statewide aggregate student performance\ndata and participation rates, cannot support such a causal connection.\n      Under Texas law the school districts are the ones having “the primary\nresponsibility for implementing the state’s” bilingual and ESL programs, TEX.\nEDUC. CODE § 11.002 (emphasis added), and the boards of trustees of such\ndistricts have “primary responsibility for ensuring the district . . . complies with\nall applicable requirements of state educational programs.” Id. § 7.028(b).\nFurther, each school district determines whether ESL or bilingual programs (or\nother transitional language instruction) are used in the seventh and eighth\n\n                                        28\n\fgrades. Id. § 29.053(d)(2). There is essentially no evidence, findings or analysis\nof the performance of any individual school districts or any groups of districts\n(whether grouped geographically, or by either overall and/or LEP student\npopulation size, or by some socio-economic criteria, or on any other basis), or of\nthe presence or absence or the extent or nature of differences in performance of\nLEP students (or students as a whole), or the nature of the bilingual or ESL\nprograms and the implementation thereof, as between different districts, or\ngroups of districts, or the like.24 There is simply no substantial evidence that\ndiverse implementation deficiencies in numerous different school districts did\nnot primarily cause the poor performance of so many secondary LEP students.\n       Moreover, the district court erred in failing to consider other possible\ncauses for the secondary LEP student failure. See, e.g., note 22, supra. The\ndistrict court did not explore alternative causes because it concluded that\nprimary and secondary LEP students suffer similar socio-economic conditions,\nbut show significantly different levels of achievement; thus, “social and economic\nfactors . . . are not the culprit.” LULAC IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 780. The trial\ncourt provided no additional evidence to support its assumption.\n       While we agree that primary and secondary LEP students in a given\nschool district likely exist in similar social and economic situations, we do not\nbelieve they are exposed to the same challenges. For example, the Supreme\nCourt recently recognized that secondary LEP students face a greater number\nof obstacles:\n       “There are many possible causes for the [under-]performance of\n       students in [LEP programs]. These include the difficulty of teaching\n       English to older students (many of whom, presumably, were not in\n\n\n       24\n          Apart from that relating to the percentage rate of parental denials in certain\ndistricts. See opinion below, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Id. The district court abused its discretion in failing to address\nother possible causes of student failure.\n      In light of the above errors, we hold that the evidence relied upon by the\ndistrict court does not establish that TEA has failed to take “appropriate action”\nto overcome language barriers nor does it establish that TEA has somehow\nabdicated responsibility in monitoring the secondary LEP program.\nNonetheless, we recognize that LEP student performance is alarming, and we\nencourage the district court and the parties involved to reconsider whether one\nor more individual school districts should be added to this litigation in order for\nit to proceed (with transfer to the proper district and division as appropriate).\nBy adding individual districts, the court can better examine the circumstances\nof specific students, schools, and districts, which will be invaluable evidence for\ndetermining the cause of LEP student failure and how best to remedy it.\n      We do not suggest that state defendants cannot be held liable under the\nEEOA. Instead, we merely hold that an appropriate analysis of an EEOA claim\nshould be conducted with regard to a particular district or districts, with state\neducational agencies serving as additional parties.26\n\n\n      25\n          This court notes that a significant difference between primary and secondary\nstudents is their ability to obtain gainful employment. Secondary students who are able to\nalter their economic position through employment will invariably have less time to devote\nto their studies and may feel added pressure to drop out of school altogether.\n      26\n      Castaneda offers just such an example, where plaintiffs appropriately initiated an\nEEOA action against a local school district and later named the TEA as a defendant. See\n\n                                            30\n\fE. Motion to Modify the Modified Order\n      This court reviews the district court’s order granting in part, and denying\nin part, defendants’ motion to modify the order, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b)(5), for abuse of discretion. Frazar v.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) provides that a party\nmay obtain relief from a court order when “applying it prospectively is no longer\nequitable.” The party seeking to modify an injunction bears the burden of\nestablishing that a significant change in factual conditions or the law warrants\nrevision of the injunction.

In Samnorwood, two school districts that voluntarily\ndesegregated in the 1960s and were not party to the original 1970 litigation\nchallenged whether the Modified Order could be appropriately applied to them.\nThis court held as follows:\n      “[T]he prophylactic provisions created by the Modified Order to\n      remedy the segregative conduct on the part of TEA and all-black\n      schools in East Texas should not be imposed on these two panhandle\n      school districts that had long previously already desegregated and\n      have never since been found to have acted with segregative intent.”\nId. at 269. Central to the court’s analysis was the fact that there had been no\nshowing of a constitutional violation by the school districts themselves, and “the\nmodified order and TEA’s actions pursuant to it constitute a remedy that must\n\n\n\n648 F.2d at 992.\n\n                                        31\n\fflow from a constitutional violation.” Id. at 268, 267–68.\n       The trial court read Samnorwood very narrowly, determining that this\nCourt’s decision was largely based on the fact that the two school districts\ninvolved had been unitary prior to the implementation of the Modified Order.\nLULAC V, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5334404</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *5. Ultimately, the district court modified the\norder in a very restrictive manner, exempting only those districts situated\nalmost identically to the Samnorwood districts. We find that this modification\nwas overly restrictive.\n       The Modified Order was issued for the purpose of eliminating the diverse\ncontinued local practices and vestiges of de jure racially segregated public\neducation.27 Since its issuance, nearly forty years have elapsed, and “the racial\ncomposition of public schools in Texas has changed drastically.” See United\nStates v.

And while this court\nrecognizes that some local vestiges of discrimination and segregation might still\nremain, it is clear that the Modified Order certainly has, at best, “dwindling\nrelevance.” Id.\n       In light of the above, and this court’s supervisory powers, we hold that the\nModified Order’s reach should be further limited. Related concerns led us to\nmodify the original order on direct appeal to provide that “[no]thing herein shall\nbe deemed to affect the jurisdiction of any other district court with respect to any\npresently pending or future school desegregation suits.” United States v. Texas,\n\n\n\n       27\n         This court, of course, recognizes that de jure racial discrimination existed in Texas.\nWe also note that in 1955 the Texas Supreme Court declared invalid, under the United\nStates Constitution, the provisions of the Texas Constitution and statutes requiring school\nracial segregation, McKinney v.

See, e.g.,\nSamnorwood, 533 F.3d at 269; Gregory-Portland, 654 F.2d at 993-94. The\ndistrict court was correct to exempt school districts similarly situated to the\nSamnorwood districts. In addition, we find that the same modification must be\nmade for local school districts declared unitary in federal cases; school districts\ncurrently under federal court desegregation orders or decrees or which are\nparties to pending federal court desegregation suits; and any other specific\nschool district not a party to the case when the Modified Order was issued which\nrequests, or for which the State requests, exemption from the Modified Order\nunless a plaintiff shows the district is not then unitary. As to such districts\nthat are thus now or subsequently exempted from the Modified Order, the\ndistrict court may no longer direct TEA with regard to such districts pursuant\nto its remedial jurisdiction over the Modified Order.28\n                                   IV. CONCLUSION\n       We hold that the district court abused its discretion in finding that\ndefendants’ violated Section G of the Modified Order because there was no\nsufficient evidence or finding of statewide de jure segregation against Mexican-\nAmericans. We also hold that the district court abused its discretion in holding\nthat defendants violated Section 1703(f) of the EEOA because the evidence\npresented does not establish that a student’s right has been violated or that\ndefendants’ acts or omissions caused any claimed violation. On remand, we\n\n\n\n       28\n         And such districts shall no longer be subject to the district court’s continuing\njurisdiction under the Modified Order.\n\n                                              33\n\finstruct the court below to reconsider whether local school districts should be\nadded to this action, and upon the inclusion of a local school district, we instruct\nthe court below to reconsider whether it constitutes an “appropriate district\ncourt” for jurisdictional purposes, or if, instead, the litigation should proceed in\na different forum appropriate to such school districts under normal venue\nprinciples.\n                         REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                        34\n\f</pre>",
