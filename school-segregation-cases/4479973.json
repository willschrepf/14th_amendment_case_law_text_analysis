On January 13, 2015, the Chancery Court of Adams County granted Jose Serio and\n\nMelissa Serio a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences and, after dividing the\n\nmarital estate, awarded permanent alimony to Melissa. Feeling aggrieved, Jose appeals and\n\nasserts that the chancery court manifestly erred in (1) computing Jose’s taxable income, (2)\n\nawarding Melissa permanent alimony, (3) classifying a bank account as nonmarital property,\n\nand (4) not classifying a tax liability as marital debt and requiring Melissa to bear a portion\n\nof the responsibility for its payment.\n\f¶2.     We find error in the chancery court’s classification of the bank account as Melissa’s\n\nseparate property. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the chancery court and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n¶3.     Jose and Melissa were married on August 18, 1995, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.1\n\nThey have two children together: Carmen Elise Serio, born February 23,1999, and Carrie\n\nMaria Serio, born September 5, 2001. During the first two years of their marriage, Jose and\n\nMelissa lived in Baton Rouge, where Jose worked at a rehabilitation hospital, and Melissa\n\ncompleted her licensed practical nurse (LPN) studies. In 1997, they moved to Natchez,\n\nMississippi, where Jose worked nights and weekends while obtaining a master’s degree and\n\ntraining to become a nurse practitioner. Jose became a licensed nurse practitioner in May\n\n2001.\n\n¶4.     The couple separated in February 2013. On September 13, 2013, Melissa filed a\n\ncomplaint for divorce on the grounds of uncondoned adultery, habitual cruel and inhuman\n\ntreatment, or, in the alternative, irreconcilable differences. Jose answered Melissa’s\n\ncomplaint for divorce and filed a counterclaim for divorce on the grounds of adultery or, in\n\nthe alternative, irreconcilable differences. In her response to Jose’s counterclaim, Melissa\n\ndenied that she had committed adultery but admitted that Jose was entitled to a divorce on\n\n\n\n        1\n        Jose and Melissa met at Hinds Community College, where Jose was attending\nnursing school.\n\n                                              2\n\fthe ground of irreconcilable differences.\n\n¶5.    On August 26, 2014, the parties entered a consent to divorce on the ground of\n\nirreconcilable differences. At that time, the parties also agreed for the chancery court to\n\ndecide (1) all issues regarding the custody, care, visitation, and financial matters surrounding\n\nthe minor children, (2) the equitable distribution of the parties’ marital estate, and (3) the\n\nentitlement of either party to attorney’s fees, alimony, and the amount thereof. During a\n\nthree-day trial, occurring October 13-15, 2014, both Melissa and Jose testified.2 The only\n\nother testimony came from Jose’s expert witness and certified public accountant Sim Mosby.\n\nOn November 17, 2014, the chancellor issued his letter opinion, which was later incorporated\n\ninto the final judgment. In the final judgment, the chancellor awarded Melissa permanent\n\nalimony in the amount of $6,400 per month. The chancellor also classified Melissa’s United\n\nMississippi Bank account (UMB account) as her separate property and awarded the account\n\nto her. Additionally, the chancellor assigned responsibility to Jose for all taxes, penalties,\n\nand interest owed on Jose’s 2013 tax return. Both parties filed post-judgment motions to\n\nalter and amend the judgment, which were denied. Jose has appealed.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n¶6.    “Our scope of review in domestic relations matters is limited. [Appellate courts] will\n\nnot disturb the findings of a chancellor unless the chancellor was manifestly wrong, clearly\n\nerroneous or an erroneous legal standard was applied.” Ferguson v. Ferguson, 639 So. 2d\n\n\n       2\n           Their daughters also testified, but it was outside of the court proceedings.\n\n                                                3\n\f921, 930 (Miss. 1994) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). However, “[appellate\n\ncourts] review[] questions of law de novo. And, after review, if warranted, [appellate courts]\n\nwill reverse the lower court because of an erroneous interpretation or application of the law.”\n\nBrooks v. Brooks, 652 So. 2d 1113, 1117 (Miss. 1995).\n\n       I.     Jose’s Income\n\n¶7.    Testimony revealed that Jose’s income was derived from various sources. He had\n\nworked for Internal Medicine Associates (Internal Medicine) since 2003. In addition, he is\n\na part-owner of two after-hours medical clinics, Natchez After-Hours Clinic (Natchez Clinic)\n\nand Oxford After-Hours Clinic (Oxford Clinic). He received income from these clinics, both\n\nas a moonlighting practical nurse and as a part owner. Jose testified that he has the following\n\nsources of income: (1) $6,000 per month in pre-tax salary from Internal Medicine; (2) an\n\nannual bonus from Internal Medicine, which equals eighteen percent of every dollar over\n\n$200,000 he collects for the fiscal year; (3) distribution checks from the Natchez Clinic, in\n\nwhich he owns a twenty-one and one-fourth percent stake; (4) income from moonlighting at\n\nthe Natchez Clinic; and (5) distribution checks from the Oxford Clinic, in which he owns a\n\ntwenty-two and one-half percent stake. Aside from a small amount that is distributed for the\n\npurposes of paying taxes, the distribution checks that Jose receives from the Oxford Clinic\n\nare currently being reinvested in the business to pay off the clinic’s debt. In 2013, Jose\n\nreceived $10,000 from the Oxford Clinic to be utilized for taxes. The chancellor determined\n\nthat “Jose’s gross income [had] remained steady from 2012-14: between $22,036-[$]24,955\n\n\n                                              4\n\fper month, on average” and that “Jose’s after-tax income [had] likewise been reasonably\n\nsteady during [that] time period and [at the time of trial was] approximately $15,700 per\n\nmonth plus the non-distributed income from [the Oxford Clinic].” During discussion of the\n\nalimony award, we will discuss in more detail the testimony, calculations, and projections\n\ninvolved in arriving at Jose’s income, which forms the basis for the chancellor’s award of\n\nalimony to Melissa.\n\n       II.    Alimony Award\n\n¶8.    Jose argues that the chancellor’s alimony award to Melissa, both in terms of the\n\nmonthly amount and its permanent nature, constitutes manifest error. More specifically, Jose\n\ncontends that Melissa should be receiving less than $6,400 per month and that the alimony,\n\nif any, should be rehabilitative instead of permanent. Jose asserts that the amount awarded\n\nfor alimony was based on an erroneous factual finding as to his after-tax income and an\n\nimproper application of the law to the evidence presented at trial.\n\n¶9.    In awarding alimony to Melissa, the chancellor followed the factors set forth in\n\nArmstrong v. Armstrong, 618 So. 2d 1278, 1280 (Miss. 1993). The court found that Melissa\n\nhad a gross monthly income of $3,503 and monthly net income of $2,853. The chancellor\n\nfound that Jose’s monthly net income was $15,700, not including his Oxford Clinic\n\ndistributions.3 As stated, the chancellor found that Jose’s gross income, ranging from\n\n\n       3\n         While the chancellor did not include Jose’s Oxford Clinic distributions, he did\naddress them, stating that the Oxford Clinic’s “profits were available for the shareholders\nto spend however they liked.” The chancellor further stated that the fact that Jose and the\n\n                                             5\n\fbetween $22,036 to $24,955 per month, had remained steady from 2012 to 2014, and that his\n\nafter-tax income had been “reasonably steady during that time period” at $15,700 per\n\nmonth—without adding the non-distributed income from the Oxford Clinic.\n\n¶10.   “Mississippi precedent establishes that the chancellor’s award of alimony ‘is a matter\n\nprimarily within the discretion of the chancery court because of its peculiar opportunity to\n\nsense the equities of the situation before it.’” Flechas v. Flechas, 724 So. 2d 948, 953 (¶14)\n\n(Miss. 1998) (quoting Tilley v. Tilley, 610 So. 2d 348, 351 (Miss. 1992)). A chancellor’s\n\naward of alimony “will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is found to be against the\n\noverwhelming weight of the evidence or manifestly in error.” Tilley, 610 So. 2d at 351.\n\n“Under the standard of review utilized to review a chancery court’s findings of fact,\n\nparticularly in the areas of divorce, alimony and child support, [appellate courts] will not\n\noverturn the court on appeal unless its findings were manifestly wrong.” Id. (internal\n\ncitations omitted). Alimony should be considered when “an equitable division of marital\n\nproperty, considered with each party's nonmarital assets, leaves a deficit for one party.”\n\nJohnson v. Johnson, 650 So. 2d 1281, 1287 (Miss. 1994).\n\n¶11.   After analyzing the parties’ living expenses, the chancellor found that Melissa’s\n\npersonal living expenses, excluding children’s expenses, would equal $8,379.30. In addition,\n\nthe chancellor determined that Jose would still have $2,690 available to him each month after\n\n\n\n\nother shareholders chose to use their wages and salaries from the Oxford Clinic as debt\nrepayment did not change the fact that it was income.\n\n                                              6\n\fpaying all his obligations and expenses. The chancellor stated: “This award of alimony [in\n\nthe amount of $6,400 per month] will not equalize the parties’ income. Jose will still have\n\nsignificantly more after-tax income available to him than Melissa.”\n\n¶12.   Jose argues that the amount of $6,400 monthly should be reversed because the\n\nchancellor erroneously based the award amount on Jose having an after-tax income of\n\n$15,700. Jose contends that the chancellor should have used his income at the time of trial,\n\nwhich was his prorated 2014 income, instead of his income from 2013, which was ten\n\nmonths earlier. He argues that his 2014 post-tax income was significantly lower than the\n\n$15,700-per-month figure on which the chancellor based his award. He also asserts that,\n\neven using Melissa’s projected 2014 amounts—yielding a tax liability of $74,964.15, an\n\nannual income of $153,794.32, and a monthly income average of $12,816.19—would still\n\nplace his financials roughly $3,000 less than the amount that the chancellor used to calculate\n\nhis alimony obligation and would leave him with a $310 monthly deficit. Additionally, Jose\n\nnotes that the chancellor’s calculation does not include Jose’s tax debt of approximately\n\n$76,000 for the tax year 2013. He further argues that the chancellor should have based his\n\nfindings on Mosby’s projections in arriving at a determination about Jose’s future earnings\n\nbecause it is unlikely that Jose will be able to continue to work three weekends per month\n\nbecause of his scheduled weekend visitations with his daughter. Jose asserts that it is\n\ninappropriate to impose a requirement of such extra work to meet his alimony obligations.\n\n¶13.   In addition, Jose argues that the chancellor’s decision to attempt to “equalize” the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fparties’ monthly incomes through alimony was inappropriate. Citing Ferguson v. Ferguson,\n\n639 So. 2d 921, 929 (Miss. 1993), Jose alleges that the division of marital property and a\n\ndecision on alimony should be made in tandem, and “where one expands, the other must\n\nrecede.” Consequently, Jose asserts that the chancellor’s alimony award to Melissa actually\n\ngrants her in perpetuity an equitable distribution of his future estate.\n\n¶14.   Mosby estimated Jose’s pre-tax and after-tax incomes for 2014 to be $199,281 and\n\n$133,976, resulting in an after-tax monthly income of $11,165. Mosby’s gross, pre-tax\n\nestimate of $199,281 was reached using the following numbers: (1) $72,000 in gross salary\n\nfrom Internal Medicine; (2) $38,823 in bonuses from Internal Medicine, all of which Jose\n\nhad already received through September 2014; (3) $13,440 from moonlighting at the Natchez\n\nClinic, which was based on an average of one weekend of moonlighting per month; and (4)\n\n$75,018 in distributions from the Natchez Clinic. However, Mosby did not include the\n\ndistributions from the Oxford Clinic.4 On cross-examination, Mosby agreed that if he had\n\nused a different method of proration than the one that he used, Jose’s distribution from the\n\nNatchez Clinic in 2014 could be projected at $75,443.88 instead of $75,018. Also, Mosby\n\nagreed that Jose had actually earned a little over $31,000 from moonlighting at the Natchez\n\nClinic, averaging three weekends per month, and using that figure would project Jose’s total\n\nincome from moonlighting to $42,491.59 instead of the $13,440 that Mosby had used based\n\n\n\n       4\n        Mosby testified that he was asked not to include the distributions from the Oxford\nClinic because they were not cash distributions.\n\n                                               8\n\fon Jose working only one weekend per month, rather than three.\n\n¶15.   In response, Melissa contends that the chancellor did not err in his calculations of\n\nJose’s gross income. Melissa contends that the chancellor’s opinion did in fact include a\n\ndiscussion of Jose’s 2014 income.        Melissa further contends that Jose declined the\n\nopportunity to present additional evidence of his 2014 income, and the record validates that\n\ncontention.\n\n¶16.   Based on the considerable discretion that a chancellor has in making factual\n\ndeterminations, this Court cannot say that the chancellor erred in determining the amount of\n\nJose’s income. This is especially true since the chancellor did not consider the income that\n\nJose received from the Oxford Clinic. The fact that Jose and his partners decided to use their\n\nprorated profits from the Oxford Clinic mostly to retire the debt against the clinic did not\n\nmean that the chancellor could not consider the distributions that Jose was entitled to in\n\nconsidering the amount of income available to Jose. This issue is without merit.\n\n¶17.   Jose also argues that the chancellor erred in granting Melissa permanent alimony\n\ninstead of rehabilitative alimony. As stated above, the chancellor followed the factors set\n\nforth in Armstrong in determining that an award of alimony to Melissa was warranted. It is\n\nwell settled:\n\n       The purpose of permanent alimony is to be a substitute for the marital-support\n       obligation. The award of permanent periodic alimony arises from the duty of\n       the husband to support his wife. We also have said that the husband is\n       required to support his wife in the manner to which she has become\n       accustomed, to the extent of his ability to pay. To update our language:\n       Consistent with Armstrong, a financially independent spouse may be required\n\n                                              9\n\f       to support the financially dependent spouse in a manner in which the\n       dependent spouse was supported during the marriage, subject to a material\n       change in circumstances.\n\nRogillio v. Rogillio, 57 So. 3d 1246, 1250 (¶11) (Miss. 2011). On the other hand:\n\n       Rehabilitative alimony is awarded to parties who have put their career on hold\n       while taking care of the marital home. Rehabilitative alimony allows the party\n       to get back into the working world in order to become self-sufficient. [It] is\n       an equitable mechanism which allows a party needing assistance to become\n       self-supporting without becoming destitute in the interim.\n\nLauro v. Lauro, 847 So. 2d 843, 849 (¶15) (Miss. 2003).\n\n¶18.   When addressing the length of the marriage, the chancellor referenced Professor\n\nDeborah Bell’s treatise, Bell on Mississippi Family Law (2d ed. 2011), noting that Bell has\n\nfound that “permanent alimony was awarded in about half of [the] marriages lasting from\n\n[ten to nineteen] years, and in 70% of marriages of twenty years or more.” Further, quoting\n\nBell, the chancellor stated:\n\n       First, income disparity is required for an award but does not automatically\n       guarantee an award. Second, once a disparity is shown, the length of marriage\n       is of great importance. . . . Third, the amount of [the] alimony award appears\n       to increase with the length of the marriage. Awards ranged from one-fourth\n       of the disparity in short marriages to awards that equalized or more than\n       equalized incomes after long marriages.\n\nBell at § 9.06[6]. The chancellor also noted the ages of the parties: (1) Melissa was forty-\n\nseven years old at the time of trial, and (2) Jose was forty-four years old at the time of trial.\n\nThe chancellor expressed that it would be difficult for Melissa to reenter the workforce as\n\nan LPN at her age. Additionally, in his order overruling Jose’s post-trial motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment, the chancellor stated:\n\n                                               10\n\f       The Court’s decision to award permanent periodic alimony as set forth in the\n       final judgment was made after considering several factors, not the least of\n       which was the fact that Melissa made substantial contributions throughout the\n       marriage, both economic and non-economic. Considering the significant\n       disparity in the parties’ income[s], that Mr. Serio’s monthly income available\n       after payment of all of his court-ordered obligations and personal expenses is\n       similar to Melissa’s monthly earned income, and that Mr. Serio’s employment\n       and earnings opportunities are trending upward, the [c]ourt declines to\n       reconsider its alimony award.\n\n¶19.   Jose argues that the evidence presented at trial favors rehabilitative alimony. He\n\ncontends that the length of the marriage should be considered neutral at best, stating that\n\nnineteen years is neither a very short nor a very long marriage. Jose also contends that the\n\nArmstrong factor addressing the parties’ health and earning capacity should have been given\n\nmore weight. Jose states that both parties are in good health and employable, despite the\n\nchancery court asserting that Melissa would have a difficult time reentering the workforce.\n\nWe cannot find the chancellor in error, as he considered the applicable law regarding alimony\n\nafter he equitably divided the marital estate and determined that periodic, rather than\n\nrehabilitative, alimony was warranted.\n\n       III.   Melissa’s UMB Account\n\n¶20.   Jose argues that the chancery court erred in classifying the $24,682.98 in Melissa’s\n\nUMB account as separate property instead of marital property. Jose contends that the\n\nchancery court’s finding— that Melissa testified without contradiction that the March 2014\n\ndeposit of $47,160.94 into her UMB account came from her inheritance from her late\n\nmother—is factually incorrect. Jose submits that Melissa offered no such testimony and that\n\n\n                                             11\n\fby the end of 2012, Melissa could have had only $26,000 of the inheritance left, calculated\n\nas follows: the original inheritance of $40,000 received in 2010, minus the $10,000 utilized\n\nfor the down payment on the home and $4,000 for a gun that Melissa purchased.5 Jose also\n\npoints out that if Melissa’s inheritance money was ever in the UMB account, it was entirely\n\ngone by 2014 because the account had a negative balance before the March 2014 deposit.\n\nJose further argues that the deposit did not come from Melissa’s inheritance but, rather, from\n\nmoney that she withdrew from the parties’ joint account during the first half of 2013.\n\n¶21.   Our review of the record supports Jose’s contention that Melissa’s UMB account had\n\na negative balance before the $47,160.94 was deposited into it on March 26, 2014. “Because\n\nassets owned by a spouse are presumed to be marital property, the party seeking to classify\n\nproperty as separate, or non-marital, bears the burden of tracing the asset to a separate-\n\nproperty source.” Allgood v. Allgood, 62 So. 3d 443, 447 (¶13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).\n\nWhen questioned about the UMB account, Melissa testified that “it was [from] money given\n\nto [her] once [her] mother passed away” but did not explain how she could have made a\n\ndeposit of $47,160.94 on March 26, 2014, when she had received only $40,000 in the\n\ninheritance in 2010, and has expended $14,000 of that amount. Nor did she explain how the\n\naccount could have reflected a negative balance prior to the March 26, 2014 deposit.\n\nBecause we find a lack of substantial evidence to support the chancellor’s finding that the\n\n$24,682.98 that was in Melissa’s UMB account was her separate property, we reverse the\n\n\n       5\n           Melissa testified to these expenditures.\n\n                                               12\n\fjudgment of the chancery court on this issue and remand the case with directions to\n\nreconsider the division of the marital estate, counting the $24,682 as marital property.\n\n       IV.    The 2013 Tax Debt\n\n¶22.   Jose contends that the chancellor erred in not classifying his 2013 tax liability as a\n\nmarital obligation and making Melissa responsible for paying a portion of it. More\n\nspecifically, Jose argues that Melissa was the one that normally handled the payment of his\n\nestimated quarterly taxes and that, after their separation, he “continued allowing Melissa to\n\ndeposit his paychecks into the joint account because he expected the parties’ usual practice\n\nof Melissa controlling the money and paying all bills to continue.” According to Jose,\n\nMelissa, rather than following the usual practice, filed her taxes separate from him and\n\nunilaterally claimed both children as dependents for the 2013 tax year. Jose further points\n\nout that one estimated quarterly tax payment was due before he separated from Melissa and\n\nthat a second one was almost due.\n\n¶23.   The chancellor found that Jose left Melissa in early March 2013 and had completely\n\nsegregated his “checks and accounts” from Melissa by mid-May. The chancellor further\n\nfound that, according to Mosby, “the $76,170 tax bill consisted primarily of the unpaid taxes\n\non Jose’s share of the income from the Oxford and Natchez clinics and that Jose had been\n\npaid $10,000 from the Oxford Clinic for the purpose of paying estimated taxes, but instead\n\nhe pocketed the money.” The chancellor ultimately found that, notwithstanding Jose’s\n\nvoluntary payment to Melissa of $8,000 per month for the remainder of 2013, he still had the\n\n\n                                             13\n\frest of his money to spend as he desired and simply chose not to pay his quarterly tax\n\nestimates for the 2013 tax year. Consequently, the chancellor determined that Jose should\n\nbe responsible for his entire 2013 tax liability. Given our deferential standard of review, we\n\ncannot say that the chancellor erred in that determination.\n\n¶24.   In conclusion, we also point out that on remand, the chancery court should determine\n\nwhether the expenditure of the $22,477.96—the March 26, 2014 deposit of $47,160.94 minus\n\nthe remaining balance of $24,682.98—was made for marital purposes. If it was not\n\nexpended for marital purposes, then Melissa should be charged with having dissipated\n\n$22,477.96 in marital assets and the appropriate credits and adjustments made accordingly.\n\nFinally, since we are reversing and remanding for a reclassification of marital property, it\n\nnecessarily follows that both the equitable division of the marital estate and the award of\n\nalimony should be revisited.\n\n¶25.

On January 13, 2015, the Chancery Court of Adams County granted Jose Serio and\n\nMelissa Serio a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences and, after dividing the\n\nmarital estate, awarded permanent alimony to Melissa. Feeling aggrieved, Jose appeals and\n\nasserts that the chancery court manifestly erred in (1) computing Jose’s taxable income, (2)\n\nawarding Melissa permanent alimony, (3) classifying a bank account as nonmarital property,\n\nand (4) not classifying a tax liability as marital debt and requiring Melissa to bear a portion\n\nof the responsibility for its payment.\n\f¶2.     We find error in the chancery court’s classification of the bank account as Melissa’s\n\nseparate property. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the chancery court and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n¶3.     Jose and Melissa were married on August 18, 1995, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.1\n\nThey have two children together: Carmen Elise Serio, born February 23,1999, and Carrie\n\nMaria Serio, born September 5, 2001. During the first two years of their marriage, Jose and\n\nMelissa lived in Baton Rouge, where Jose worked at a rehabilitation hospital, and Melissa\n\ncompleted her licensed practical nurse (LPN) studies. In 1997, they moved to Natchez,\n\nMississippi, where Jose worked nights and weekends while obtaining a master’s degree and\n\ntraining to become a nurse practitioner. Jose became a licensed nurse practitioner in May\n\n2001.\n\n¶4.     The couple separated in February 2013. On September 13, 2013, Melissa filed a\n\ncomplaint for divorce on the grounds of uncondoned adultery, habitual cruel and inhuman\n\ntreatment, or, in the alternative, irreconcilable differences. Jose answered Melissa’s\n\ncomplaint for divorce and filed a counterclaim for divorce on the grounds of adultery or, in\n\nthe alternative, irreconcilable differences. In her response to Jose’s counterclaim, Melissa\n\ndenied that she had committed adultery but admitted that Jose was entitled to a divorce on\n\n\n\n        1\n        Jose and Melissa met at Hinds Community College, where Jose was attending\nnursing school.\n\n                                              2\n\fthe ground of irreconcilable differences.\n\n¶5.    On August 26, 2014, the parties entered a consent to divorce on the ground of\n\nirreconcilable differences. At that time, the parties also agreed for the chancery court to\n\ndecide (1) all issues regarding the custody, care, visitation, and financial matters surrounding\n\nthe minor children, (2) the equitable distribution of the parties’ marital estate, and (3) the\n\nentitlement of either party to attorney’s fees, alimony, and the amount thereof. During a\n\nthree-day trial, occurring October 13-15, 2014, both Melissa and Jose testified.2 The only\n\nother testimony came from Jose’s expert witness and certified public accountant Sim Mosby.\n\nOn November 17, 2014, the chancellor issued his letter opinion, which was later incorporated\n\ninto the final judgment. In the final judgment, the chancellor awarded Melissa permanent\n\nalimony in the amount of $6,400 per month. The chancellor also classified Melissa’s United\n\nMississippi Bank account (UMB account) as her separate property and awarded the account\n\nto her. Additionally, the chancellor assigned responsibility to Jose for all taxes, penalties,\n\nand interest owed on Jose’s 2013 tax return. Both parties filed post-judgment motions to\n\nalter and amend the judgment, which were denied. Jose has appealed.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n¶6.    “Our scope of review in domestic relations matters is limited. [Appellate courts] will\n\nnot disturb the findings of a chancellor unless the chancellor was manifestly wrong, clearly\n\nerroneous or an erroneous legal standard was applied.” Ferguson v. Ferguson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n\n       <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n           Their daughters also testified, but it was outside of the court proceedings.\n\n                                                3\n\f921, 930 (Miss. 1994) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). However, “[appellate\n\ncourts] review[] questions of law de novo. And, after review, if warranted, [appellate courts]\n\nwill reverse the lower court because of an erroneous interpretation or application of the law.”\n\nBrooks v. Brooks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1113923\"><a href=\"/opinion/1113923/brooks-v-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1117 (Miss. 1995).\n\n       I.     Jose’s Income\n\n¶7.    Testimony revealed that Jose’s income was derived from various sources. He had\n\nworked for Internal Medicine Associates (Internal Medicine) since 2003. In addition, he is\n\na part-owner of two after-hours medical clinics, Natchez After-Hours Clinic (Natchez Clinic)\n\nand Oxford After-Hours Clinic (Oxford Clinic). He received income from these clinics, both\n\nas a moonlighting practical nurse and as a part owner. Jose testified that he has the following\n\nsources of income: (1) $6,000 per month in pre-tax salary from Internal Medicine; (2) an\n\nannual bonus from Internal Medicine, which equals eighteen percent of every dollar over\n\n$200,000 he collects for the fiscal year; (3) distribution checks from the Natchez Clinic, in\n\nwhich he owns a twenty-one and one-fourth percent stake; (4) income from moonlighting at\n\nthe Natchez Clinic; and (5) distribution checks from the Oxford Clinic, in which he owns a\n\ntwenty-two and one-half percent stake. Aside from a small amount that is distributed for the\n\npurposes of paying taxes, the distribution checks that Jose receives from the Oxford Clinic\n\nare currently being reinvested in the business to pay off the clinic’s debt. In 2013, Jose\n\nreceived $10,000 from the Oxford Clinic to be utilized for taxes. The chancellor determined\n\nthat “Jose’s gross income [had] remained steady from 2012-14: between $22,036-[$]24,955\n\n\n                                              4\n\fper month, on average” and that “Jose’s after-tax income [had] likewise been reasonably\n\nsteady during [that] time period and [at the time of trial was] approximately $15,700 per\n\nmonth plus the non-distributed income from [the Oxford Clinic].” During discussion of the\n\nalimony award, we will discuss in more detail the testimony, calculations, and projections\n\ninvolved in arriving at Jose’s income, which forms the basis for the chancellor’s award of\n\nalimony to Melissa.\n\n       II.    Alimony Award\n\n¶8.    Jose argues that the chancellor’s alimony award to Melissa, both in terms of the\n\nmonthly amount and its permanent nature, constitutes manifest error. More specifically, Jose\n\ncontends that Melissa should be receiving less than $6,400 per month and that the alimony,\n\nif any, should be rehabilitative instead of permanent. Jose asserts that the amount awarded\n\nfor alimony was based on an erroneous factual finding as to his after-tax income and an\n\nimproper application of the law to the evidence presented at trial.\n\n¶9.    In awarding alimony to Melissa, the chancellor followed the factors set forth in\n\nArmstrong v. Armstrong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1802156\"><a href=\"/opinion/1802156/armstrong-v-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1280 (Miss. 1993). The court found that Melissa\n\nhad a gross monthly income of $3,503 and monthly net income of $2,853. The chancellor\n\nfound that Jose’s monthly net income was $15,700, not including his Oxford Clinic\n\ndistributions.3 As stated, the chancellor found that Jose’s gross income, ranging from\n\n\n       3\n         While the chancellor did not include Jose’s Oxford Clinic distributions, he did\naddress them, stating that the Oxford Clinic’s “profits were available for the shareholders\nto spend however they liked.” The chancellor further stated that the fact that Jose and the\n\n                                             5\n\fbetween $22,036 to $24,955 per month, had remained steady from 2012 to 2014, and that his\n\nafter-tax income had been “reasonably steady during that time period” at $15,700 per\n\nmonth—without adding the non-distributed income from the Oxford Clinic.\n\n¶10.   “Mississippi precedent establishes that the chancellor’s award of alimony ‘is a matter\n\nprimarily within the discretion of the chancery court because of its peculiar opportunity to\n\nsense the equities of the situation before it.’” Flechas v. Flechas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1847782\"><a href=\"/opinion/1847782/flechas-v-flechas/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 953 (¶14)\n\n(Miss. 1998) (quoting Tilley v. Tilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1849974\"><a href=\"/opinion/1849974/tilley-v-tilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (Miss. 1992)). A chancellor’s\n\naward of alimony “will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is found to be against the\n\noverwhelming weight of the evidence or manifestly in error.” Tilley, 610 So. 2d at 351.\n\n“Under the standard of review utilized to review a chancery court’s findings of fact,\n\nparticularly in the areas of divorce, alimony and child support, [appellate courts] will not\n\noverturn the court on appeal unless its findings were manifestly wrong.” Id. (internal\n\ncitations omitted). Alimony should be considered when “an equitable division of marital\n\nproperty, considered with each party's nonmarital assets, leaves a deficit for one party.”\n\nJohnson v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1751673\"><a href=\"/opinion/1751673/johnson-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1287 (Miss. 1994).\n\n¶11.   After analyzing the parties’ living expenses, the chancellor found that Melissa’s\n\npersonal living expenses, excluding children’s expenses, would equal $8,379.30. In addition,\n\nthe chancellor determined that Jose would still have $2,690 available to him each month after\n\n\n\n\nother shareholders chose to use their wages and salaries from the Oxford Clinic as debt\nrepayment did not change the fact that it was income.\n\n                                              6\n\fpaying all his obligations and expenses. The chancellor stated: “This award of alimony [in\n\nthe amount of $6,400 per month] will not equalize the parties’ income. Jose will still have\n\nsignificantly more after-tax income available to him than Melissa.”\n\n¶12.   Jose argues that the amount of $6,400 monthly should be reversed because the\n\nchancellor erroneously based the award amount on Jose having an after-tax income of\n\n$15,700. Jose contends that the chancellor should have used his income at the time of trial,\n\nwhich was his prorated 2014 income, instead of his income from 2013, which was ten\n\nmonths earlier. He argues that his 2014 post-tax income was significantly lower than the\n\n$15,700-per-month figure on which the chancellor based his award. He also asserts that,\n\neven using Melissa’s projected 2014 amounts—yielding a tax liability of $74,964.15, an\n\nannual income of $153,794.32, and a monthly income average of $12,816.19—would still\n\nplace his financials roughly $3,000 less than the amount that the chancellor used to calculate\n\nhis alimony obligation and would leave him with a $310 monthly deficit. Additionally, Jose\n\nnotes that the chancellor’s calculation does not include Jose’s tax debt of approximately\n\n$76,000 for the tax year 2013. He further argues that the chancellor should have based his\n\nfindings on Mosby’s projections in arriving at a determination about Jose’s future earnings\n\nbecause it is unlikely that Jose will be able to continue to work three weekends per month\n\nbecause of his scheduled weekend visitations with his daughter. Jose asserts that it is\n\ninappropriate to impose a requirement of such extra work to meet his alimony obligations.\n\n¶13.   In addition, Jose argues that the chancellor’s decision to attempt to “equalize” the\n\n\n                                              7\n\fparties’ monthly incomes through alimony was inappropriate. Citing Ferguson v. Ferguson,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 929 (Miss. 1993), Jose alleges that the division of marital property and a\n\ndecision on alimony should be made in tandem, and “where one expands, the other must\n\nrecede.” Consequently, Jose asserts that the chancellor’s alimony award to Melissa actually\n\ngrants her in perpetuity an equitable distribution of his future estate.\n\n¶14.   Mosby estimated Jose’s pre-tax and after-tax incomes for 2014 to be $199,281 and\n\n$133,976, resulting in an after-tax monthly income of $11,165. Mosby’s gross, pre-tax\n\nestimate of $199,281 was reached using the following numbers: (1) $72,000 in gross salary\n\nfrom Internal Medicine; (2) $38,823 in bonuses from Internal Medicine, all of which Jose\n\nhad already received through September 2014; (3) $13,440 from moonlighting at the Natchez\n\nClinic, which was based on an average of one weekend of moonlighting per month; and (4)\n\n$75,018 in distributions from the Natchez Clinic. However, Mosby did not include the\n\ndistributions from the Oxford Clinic.4 On cross-examination, Mosby agreed that if he had\n\nused a different method of proration than the one that he used, Jose’s distribution from the\n\nNatchez Clinic in 2014 could be projected at $75,443.88 instead of $75,018. Also, Mosby\n\nagreed that Jose had actually earned a little over $31,000 from moonlighting at the Natchez\n\nClinic, averaging three weekends per month, and using that figure would project Jose’s total\n\nincome from moonlighting to $42,491.59 instead of the $13,440 that Mosby had used based\n\n\n\n       4\n        Mosby testified that he was asked not to include the distributions from the Oxford\nClinic because they were not cash distributions.\n\n                                               8\n\fon Jose working only one weekend per month, rather than three.\n\n¶15.   In response, Melissa contends that the chancellor did not err in his calculations of\n\nJose’s gross income. Melissa contends that the chancellor’s opinion did in fact include a\n\ndiscussion of Jose’s 2014 income.        Melissa further contends that Jose declined the\n\nopportunity to present additional evidence of his 2014 income, and the record validates that\n\ncontention.\n\n¶16.   Based on the considerable discretion that a chancellor has in making factual\n\ndeterminations, this Court cannot say that the chancellor erred in determining the amount of\n\nJose’s income. This is especially true since the chancellor did not consider the income that\n\nJose received from the Oxford Clinic. The fact that Jose and his partners decided to use their\n\nprorated profits from the Oxford Clinic mostly to retire the debt against the clinic did not\n\nmean that the chancellor could not consider the distributions that Jose was entitled to in\n\nconsidering the amount of income available to Jose. This issue is without merit.\n\n¶17.   Jose also argues that the chancellor erred in granting Melissa permanent alimony\n\ninstead of rehabilitative alimony. As stated above, the chancellor followed the factors set\n\nforth in Armstrong in determining that an award of alimony to Melissa was warranted. It is\n\nwell settled:\n\n       The purpose of permanent alimony is to be a substitute for the marital-support\n       obligation. The award of permanent periodic alimony arises from the duty of\n       the husband to support his wife. We also have said that the husband is\n       required to support his wife in the manner to which she has become\n       accustomed, to the extent of his ability to pay. To update our language:\n       Consistent with Armstrong, a financially independent spouse may be required\n\n                                              9\n\f       to support the financially dependent spouse in a manner in which the\n       dependent spouse was supported during the marriage, subject to a material\n       change in circumstances.\n\nRogillio v. Rogillio, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1250 (¶11) (Miss. 2011). On the other hand:\n\n       Rehabilitative alimony is awarded to parties who have put their career on hold\n       while taking care of the marital home. Rehabilitative alimony allows the party\n       to get back into the working world in order to become self-sufficient. [It] is\n       an equitable mechanism which allows a party needing assistance to become\n       self-supporting without becoming destitute in the interim.\n\nLauro v. Lauro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1702585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1702585/lauro-v-lauro/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 849 (¶15) (Miss. 2003).\n\n¶18.   When addressing the length of the marriage, the chancellor referenced Professor\n\nDeborah Bell’s treatise, Bell on Mississippi Family Law (2d ed. 2011), noting that Bell has\n\nfound that “permanent alimony was awarded in about half of [the] marriages lasting from\n\n[ten to nineteen] years, and in 70% of marriages of twenty years or more.” Further, quoting\n\nBell, the chancellor stated:\n\n       First, income disparity is required for an award but does not automatically\n       guarantee an award. Second, once a disparity is shown, the length of marriage\n       is of great importance. . . . Third, the amount of [the] alimony award appears\n       to increase with the length of the marriage. Awards ranged from one-fourth\n       of the disparity in short marriages to awards that equalized or more than\n       equalized incomes after long marriages.\n\nBell at § 9.06[6]. The chancellor also noted the ages of the parties: (1) Melissa was forty-\n\nseven years old at the time of trial, and (2) Jose was forty-four years old at the time of trial.\n\nThe chancellor expressed that it would be difficult for Melissa to reenter the workforce as\n\nan LPN at her age. Additionally, in his order overruling Jose’s post-trial motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment, the chancellor stated:\n\n                                               10\n\f       The Court’s decision to award permanent periodic alimony as set forth in the\n       final judgment was made after considering several factors, not the least of\n       which was the fact that Melissa made substantial contributions throughout the\n       marriage, both economic and non-economic. Considering the significant\n       disparity in the parties’ income[s], that Mr. Serio’s monthly income available\n       after payment of all of his court-ordered obligations and personal expenses is\n       similar to Melissa’s monthly earned income, and that Mr. Serio’s employment\n       and earnings opportunities are trending upward, the [c]ourt declines to\n       reconsider its alimony award.\n\n¶19.   Jose argues that the evidence presented at trial favors rehabilitative alimony. He\n\ncontends that the length of the marriage should be considered neutral at best, stating that\n\nnineteen years is neither a very short nor a very long marriage. Jose also contends that the\n\nArmstrong factor addressing the parties’ health and earning capacity should have been given\n\nmore weight. Jose states that both parties are in good health and employable, despite the\n\nchancery court asserting that Melissa would have a difficult time reentering the workforce.\n\nWe cannot find the chancellor in error, as he considered the applicable law regarding alimony\n\nafter he equitably divided the marital estate and determined that periodic, rather than\n\nrehabilitative, alimony was warranted.\n\n       III.   Melissa’s UMB Account\n\n¶20.   Jose argues that the chancery court erred in classifying the $24,682.98 in Melissa’s\n\nUMB account as separate property instead of marital property. Jose contends that the\n\nchancery court’s finding— that Melissa testified without contradiction that the March 2014\n\ndeposit of $47,160.94 into her UMB account came from her inheritance from her late\n\nmother—is factually incorrect. Jose submits that Melissa offered no such testimony and that\n\n\n                                             11\n\fby the end of 2012, Melissa could have had only $26,000 of the inheritance left, calculated\n\nas follows: the original inheritance of $40,000 received in 2010, minus the $10,000 utilized\n\nfor the down payment on the home and $4,000 for a gun that Melissa purchased.5 Jose also\n\npoints out that if Melissa’s inheritance money was ever in the UMB account, it was entirely\n\ngone by 2014 because the account had a negative balance before the March 2014 deposit.\n\nJose further argues that the deposit did not come from Melissa’s inheritance but, rather, from\n\nmoney that she withdrew from the parties’ joint account during the first half of 2013.\n\n¶21.   Our review of the record supports Jose’s contention that Melissa’s UMB account had\n\na negative balance before the $47,160.94 was deposited into it on March 26, 2014. “Because\n\nassets owned by a spouse are presumed to be marital property, the party seeking to classify\n\nproperty as separate, or non-marital, bears the burden of tracing the asset to a separate-\n\nproperty source.” Allgood v. Allgood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2494514\"><a href=\"/opinion/2494514/allgood-v-allgood/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447 (¶13) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011).\n\nWhen questioned about the UMB account, Melissa testified that “it was [from] money given\n\nto [her] once [her] mother passed away” but did not explain how she could have made a\n\ndeposit of $47,160.94 on March 26, 2014, when she had received only $40,000 in the\n\ninheritance in 2010, and has expended $14,000 of that amount. Nor did she explain how the\n\naccount could have reflected a negative balance prior to the March 26, 2014 deposit.\n\nBecause we find a lack of substantial evidence to support the chancellor’s finding that the\n\n$24,682.98 that was in Melissa’s UMB account was her separate property, we reverse the\n\n\n       5\n           Melissa testified to these expenditures.\n\n                                               12\n\fjudgment of the chancery court on this issue and remand the case with directions to\n\nreconsider the division of the marital estate, counting the $24,682 as marital property.\n\n       IV.    The 2013 Tax Debt\n\n¶22.   Jose contends that the chancellor erred in not classifying his 2013 tax liability as a\n\nmarital obligation and making Melissa responsible for paying a portion of it. More\n\nspecifically, Jose argues that Melissa was the one that normally handled the payment of his\n\nestimated quarterly taxes and that, after their separation, he “continued allowing Melissa to\n\ndeposit his paychecks into the joint account because he expected the parties’ usual practice\n\nof Melissa controlling the money and paying all bills to continue.” According to Jose,\n\nMelissa, rather than following the usual practice, filed her taxes separate from him and\n\nunilaterally claimed both children as dependents for the 2013 tax year. Jose further points\n\nout that one estimated quarterly tax payment was due before he separated from Melissa and\n\nthat a second one was almost due.\n\n¶23.   The chancellor found that Jose left Melissa in early March 2013 and had completely\n\nsegregated his “checks and accounts” from Melissa by mid-May. The chancellor further\n\nfound that, according to Mosby, “the $76,170 tax bill consisted primarily of the unpaid taxes\n\non Jose’s share of the income from the Oxford and Natchez clinics and that Jose had been\n\npaid $10,000 from the Oxford Clinic for the purpose of paying estimated taxes, but instead\n\nhe pocketed the money.” The chancellor ultimately found that, notwithstanding Jose’s\n\nvoluntary payment to Melissa of $8,000 per month for the remainder of 2013, he still had the\n\n\n                                             13\n\frest of his money to spend as he desired and simply chose not to pay his quarterly tax\n\nestimates for the 2013 tax year. Consequently, the chancellor determined that Jose should\n\nbe responsible for his entire 2013 tax liability. Given our deferential standard of review, we\n\ncannot say that the chancellor erred in that determination.\n\n¶24.   In conclusion, we also point out that on remand, the chancery court should determine\n\nwhether the expenditure of the $22,477.96—the March 26, 2014 deposit of $47,160.94 minus\n\nthe remaining balance of $24,682.98—was made for marital purposes. If it was not\n\nexpended for marital purposes, then Melissa should be charged with having dissipated\n\n$22,477.96 in marital assets and the appropriate credits and adjustments made accordingly.\n\nFinally, since we are reversing and remanding for a reclassification of marital property, it\n\nnecessarily follows that both the equitable division of the marital estate and the award of\n\nalimony should be revisited.\n\n¶25.
