The legislative history of &#167; 2282 and of its complement, &#167; 2281, requiring three judges to hear injunctive suits directed against federal and state legislation, respectively, indicates that these sections were enacted to prevent a single federal judge from being able to paralyze totally the operation of an entire regulatory scheme, either state or federal, by issuance of a broad injunctive order.  Section 2281 'was a means of protecting the increasing body of state legislation regulating economic enterprise from invalidation by a conventional suit in equity.  . . .  The crux of the business is procedural protection against an improvident state-wide doom by a federal court of a state's legislative policy.  This was the aim of Congress . . . .'  Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 250-251 (61 S.Ct. 480, 85 L.Ed. 800).  Repeatedly emphasized during the congressional debates on &#167; 2282 were the heavy pecuniary costs of the unforeseen and debilitating interruptions in the administration of federal law which could be wrought by a single judge's order, and the great burdens entailed in coping with harassing actions brought one after another to challenge the operation of an entire statutory scheme, wherever jurisdiction over government officials could be acquired, until a judge was ultimately found who would grant the desired injunction.  81 Cong.Rec. 479-481, 2142-2143 (1937).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The present action, which in form was for declaratory relief and which in its agreed substance did not contemplate injunctive relief, involves none of the dangers to which Congress was addressing itself.  The relief sought and the order entered affected an Act of Congress in a totally noncoercive fashion.  There was no interdiction of the operation at large of the statute.  It was declared unconstitutional, but without even an injunctive sanction against the application of the statute by the Government to Mendoza-Martinez.  Pending review in the Court of Appeals and in this Court, the Government has been free to continue to apply the statute.  That being the case, there is here no conflict with the purpose of Congress to provide for the convocation of a three-judge court whenever the operation of a statutory scheme may be immediately disrupted before a final judicial determination of the validity of the trial court's order can be obtained.  Thus there was no reason whatever in this case to invoke the special and extraordinary procedure of a three-judge court.  Compare Schneider v. Rusk, 372 U.S. 224, 83 S.Ct. 621, 91 L.Ed.2d 695, decided this day.

New Left Education Project, 404 U.S. 541, 542, 92 S.Ct. 652, 653, 30 L.Ed.2d 697 (1972), the Court stated that a three-judge court is required:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>where the challenged statute or regulation, albeit created or authorized by a state legislature, has statewide application or effectuates a statewide policy.

Mendoza-Martinez, supra, nor did the order either give or take away any duties from state officials.  Indeed, the district court specifically noted that the legislation was unconstitutional insofar as it impedes the mandates of the Sixth Circuit to eliminate racially identifiable schools in Jefferson County; it presumably remains good law elsewhere in Kentucky.  Thus, under the facts of this case, the convening of a three-judge court was not required.  See Whatley v. Clark, 482 F.2d 1230, 1231 (5th Cir. 1973), Cert. denied, 415 U.S. 934, 94 S.Ct. 1449, 39 L.Ed.2d 492 (1974); Triple A Realty Inc. v.

Mendoza-Martinez, supra, nor did the order either give or take away any duties from state officials.  Indeed, the district court specifically noted that the legislation was unconstitutional insofar as it impedes the mandates of the Sixth Circuit to eliminate racially identifiable schools in Jefferson County; it presumably remains good law elsewhere in Kentucky.  Thus, under the facts of this case, the convening of a three-judge court was not required.  See Whatley v.
