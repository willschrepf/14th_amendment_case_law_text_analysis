Civil No. 98-cv-03417)\nDistrict Judge: Hon. J. Curtis Joyner\n\nArgued May 31, 2001\n\nBefore: SLOVITER, FUENTES and COWEN, Circuit   Judges\n\n(Filed: November 1, 2001)\n\n       Melvin E. Lefkowitz (Argued)\n       Hogan & Hartson\n       Washington, D.C. 20004-1109\n\n        Attorney for Appellant\n\n       Charles Bricken (Argued)\n       Richard Farber\n       United States Department of Justice\n       Washington, D.C. 20044\n\n        Attorneys for Appellee\n\fOPINION OF THE COURT\n\nSLOVITER, Circuit Judge.\n\nI.\n\nAt issue in this case is the interpretation of a Closing\nAgreement between the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\")\nand appellant Bethlehem Steel Corporation (\"Bethlehem\" or\n\"taxpayer\") that preceded the payout by the IRS to\nBethlehem of a refund of an anticipated overpayment of\ntaxes, subject to later audit. Resolution of the issue\ndepends on whether an anti-retroactivity clause in the\nagreement prevents the IRS from applying retroactive\nlegislation, enacted after the parties' execution of the\nClosing Agreement, in determining Bethlehem's tax liability.\nThe District Court held that the language of the clause\nlimits its protection to \"terms\" of the agreement, and that\nthe amount of the cash-out and the method by which it\nwould be calculated were not \"terms\" of the agreement. The\nDistrict Court therefore granted summary judgment to the\nIRS. Bethlehem appeals.\n\nII.\n\nUnder the law applicable from 1976 to 1986, domestic\nmanufacturers could claim tax credits based on certain\nmodernization investments. If not fully used in the year\nearned, these credits could be \"carried forward\" for use in\nfuture years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (\"TRA\")1 repealed\nthe investment credit for property placed in service after\nDecember 31, 1985, and reduced the value of unused\ncredits. One of various transition rules enacted in\nconjunction with the repeal provided a tax benefit for\nqualified domestic steel manufacturers, such as Bethlehem,\nwhich were in dire financial straits and unlikely to generate\nsufficient income to use their remaining tax credits.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085 (codified as amended in scattered\nsections of 26 U.S.C.).\n\n                               2\n\fUnder TRA S 212, the steel manufacturers could elect to\ntreat 50% of their unused credits (\"existing carryforwards\")\nas an income tax payment for the first taxable year after\nDecember 31, 1986, thereby enabling them to \"cash out\"\nthe credits through a \"refund\" for overpayment of taxes.\nBecause this benefit was intended to enable the qualified\ncompanies to modernize their operations, S 212(f) required\nthe companies to reinvest their refunds into their\nbusinesses, although the TRA did not set a reinvestment\ndeadline. Moreover, while the statute's definition of\n\"existing carryforwards\" included 1986 credits, see TRA\nS 212(g)(2), the Conference Report on the statute clearly\nstated Congress' intent to include credits only through\n1985, see 2 H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-841, at 65 (1986). The\nHouse of Representatives passed a bill in 1987 that would\nhave retroactively amended S 212 to exclude 1986 credits,\nbut the Senate never addressed that bill.\n\nMeanwhile, Bethlehem and other eligible steel companies\n(collectively, the \"Steel Companies\") anticipated large 1987\nrefunds as a result of S 212. In February and March, 1988,\na committee of the Steel Companies (including Bethlehem)\nmet with the IRS to discuss how to obtain the refunds prior\nto the actual filing (and auditing) of their 1987 returns. It\nwas not unusual for steel companies to obtain extensions\nfor filing their tax returns because of the complexity of their\nbusiness affairs. The Steel Companies wanted the IRS to\nissue the refunds on March 15, 1988, the statutory date of\ntheir \"overpayments,\" and there is legislative history that\nSenators interested in the bill intended that the cash-outs\nbe quickly released. See 132 Cong. Rec. S8269 (1986)\n(statements of Sens. Heinz and Packwood). The Steel\nCompanies initially proposed that the agency process the\nrefunds using an expedited procedure designed to adjust\noverpayment of estimated income taxes. The IRS rejected\nthis proposal, negotiating to ensure that it had time to\naudit the refunds and that the Steel Companies complied\nwith S 212's reinvestment mandate. In return for\nconcessions in these areas, the IRS agreed to issue the\nrefunds promptly upon receipt of the Steel Companies'\nclaims. To memorialize the parties' agreement, the IRS\ndrafted a \"Closing Agreement on Final Determination\n\n                               3\n\fCovering Specific Matters\" (\"Closing Agreement\") without\nsignificant input from the Steel Companies.\n\nOn March 9 and 11, 1988, respectively, Bethlehem and\nthe IRS signed the Closing Agreement. It provided:\n\n        WHEREAS, [Bethlehem ] anticipates an overpayment\n       of its federal income tax liability for its [1987] taxable\n       year . . . resulting from the application of [S] 212 of the\n       [TRA] and desires a quick release by the [IRS] of any\n       such overpayment; and\n\n        WHEREAS, [Bethlehem ] may be unable to file its\n       federal income tax return for [1987] . . . by its due date\n       determined without regard to any time to file extension.\n\n        NOW IT IS HEREBY DETERMINED AND AGREED for\n       federal income tax purposes that:\n\n       1) [Bethlehem ] agrees that the period of limitations\n       for the [IRS] to bring suit to recover any amount\n       of such overpayment claimed by [Bethlehem ]\n       that is determined to be erroneous or excessive\n       shall not expire prior to the expiration of the\n       period of limitations on assessment of tax . . .\n       with respect to [Bethlehem's] federal income tax\n       return for [1987] . . . .\n\n       2) [Bethlehem ] agrees that the amount determined\n       under [S] 212 of the [TRA] will be spent within 3\n       years of the date of the refund for reinvestment\n       in and modernization of its steel operations\n       through investment in modern plant and\n       equipment, research and development, and other\n       appropriate projects . . ., as required by [S] 212(f)\n       of the [TRA].\n\n       3) The [IRS] agrees to effect a prompt release of any\n       refund due upon the filing by [Bethlehem ] of the\n       election and claim for the quick release of\n       refund.\n\n        WHEREAS, the determinations set forth above are\n       hereby agreed to by the [IRS], and by [Bethlehem ],\n       including its successors and assigns.\n\n                               4\n\f        NOW THIS CLOSING AGREEMENT WITNESSETH,\n       that [Bethlehem ] and [the IRS] hereby mutually agree\n       that the determinations set forth above shall be final\n       and conclusive, subject, however, to reopening in the\n       event of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of\n       material fact; furthermore, no change or modification of\n       applicable statutes will render this agreement ineffective\n       with respect to the terms agreed to herein.\n\nApp. at 30-31 (emphasis added). It is conceded that the\n\"anti-retroactivity\" clause, underlined above,\"was never an\nissue\" in the IRS-Steel Companies meetings. App. at 126.\n\nThe IRS also drafted, again without significant input from\nthe Steel Companies, an \"Election and Claim for Quick\nRelease of Overpayment Resulting from the Application of\nSection 212 of the Tax Reform Act\" of 1986 (\"Claim Form\"),\nwhich the Steel Companies were to use to request their\nrefunds. App. at 36. The Claim Form referred to\"the\nelection required under [TRA S] 212,\" allowed the electing\ncompany to specify the percentage of \"existing\ncarryforwards as defined in [TRA S] 212(g)(2)\" to which its\nelection would apply, and required the company to list the\ncarryforwards supporting its refund calculation. App. at 36-\n37. On March 15, 1988, Bethlehem filed its Claim Form,\nelecting the S 212 cash-out, and claiming a $140,428,024\nrefund based on $280,856,047 of existing carryforwards. It\nexplicitly included its 1986 credits in its refund calculations\nwhich it attached to the form, as required. The IRS paid the\nclaimed refund on March 25, 1988.\n\nBethlehem filed its consolidated 1987 income tax return\non August 8, 1988. On November 10, Congress enacted the\nTechnical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988\n(\"TAMRA\").2 TAMRA S 1002(f)(5) amended TRA S 212 to\nexclude 1986 credits from the definition of \"existing\ncarryforwards\" used to calculate S 212 refunds, and\nS 1019(a) provided that this \"amendment . .. shall take\neffect as if included in the provision of the Reform Act to\nwhich [it] relates.\" Consequently, upon its audit of\nBethlehem's 1987 tax return, the IRS determined that the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Pub. L. No. 100-647, 102 Stat. 3342 (codified as amended in scattered\nsections of 26 U.S.C.).\n\n                               5\n\fcompany's 1986 credits, worth $11,381,450, should not\nhave been included in calculating the company'sS 212\nrefund. The IRS and Bethlehem entered into an agreement\nwhereby the company agreed to pay the resulting deficiency\nof $5,690,725 plus interest, for a total of $13,397,164, but\nreserved its right to claim a refund based on its purported\nright to include 1986 credits in its S 212 refund\ncalculations. Bethlehem paid the assessment and sought\nthe refund, which the IRS disallowed on April 9, 1998.\n\nIII.\n\nOn July 2, 1998, Bethlehem sued the IRS to recover the\nrefund, arguing that the Agreement's anti-retroactivity\nclause barred the application of TAMRA to exclude 1986\ncredits from the calculation of its S 212 refund. After\nsubmitting a stipulated record, the parties cross-moved for\nsummary judgment. The District Court denied both\nmotions, finding the Agreement ambiguous. After discovery,\nthe parties again cross-moved for summary judgment.\n\nOn August 7, 2000, the court granted the IRS's motion\nand denied Bethlehem's motion. See Bethlehem Steel Corp.\nv. United States, 108 F. Supp. 2d 449 (E.D. Pa. 2000). After\nconsidering extrinsic evidence, it found that the\nAgreement's overriding purpose was to expedite\nBethlehem's receipt of its refund, and that the parties\nnegotiated and agreed to provisions providing for: (1)\nprompt release of the refund, (2) an extension of the IRS's\nstatute of limitations for challenging the refund, and (3) a\ndeadline for Bethlehem's reinvestment of the refund.\nFinding that neither the amount nor the method of\ncalculating the refund were negotiated terms of the\nAgreement, the court held that they were not protected by\nthe Agreement's narrow anti-retroactivity clause. Bethlehem\ntimely filed its notice of appeal.\n\nThe District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nSS 1331, 1346(a)(1). This court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. S 1291, and conducts a plenary review of the\nDistrict Court's summary judgment rulings. See Wheeler v.\nTowanda Area Sch. Dist., 950 F.2d 128, 129 (3d Cir. 1991).\n\n                               6\n\fIV.\n\nThe IRS is authorized to enter into closing agreements\nwhich are \"final and conclusive . . . except upon a showing\nof fraud or malfeasance, or misrepresentation of a material\nfact.\" 26 U.S.C. S 7121(b). Courts interpret closing\nagreements according to general federal contract law\nprinciples. See United States v. Nat'l Steel Corp., 75 F.3d\n1146, 1150 (7th Cir. 1996); Rink v. Comm'r, 47 F.3d 168,\n171 (6th Cir. 1995).\n\nWe determine a contract's meaning as a matter of law\nwhen its language is clear and unambiguous, see Int'l\nUnion v. Skinner Engine Co., 188 F.3d 130, 138 (3d Cir.\n1999), but may use extrinsic evidence to clarify the\nmeaning of an ambiguous contract. See In re New Valley\nCorp., 89 F.3d 143, 150 (3d Cir. 1996). We have stated that\n\"[t]o decide whether a contract is ambiguous, we do not\nsimply determine whether, from our point of view, the\nlanguage is clear. . . . [W]e consider the contract language,\nthe meanings suggested by counsel, and the extrinsic\nevidence offered in support of each interpretation. Extrinsic\nevidence may include the structure of the contract, the\nbargaining history, and the conduct of the parties that\nreflects their understanding of the contract's meaning.\"\nTeamsters Indus. Employees Welfare Fund v. Rolls-Royce\nMotor Cars, Inc., 989 F.2d 132, 135 (3d Cir. 1993) (citations\nomitted); see also In re New Valley Corp., 89 F.3d at 150.\n\nIn its discussion of the Agreement, the District Court\ncited the Seventh Circuit's interpretation of an identical\nclosing agreement between the IRS and another of the Steel\nCompanies. See Bethlehem Steel Corp., 108 F. Supp.2d at\n453; Nat'l Steel, 75 F.3d at 1152. In National Steel, the\ncourt held that the purpose of the closing agreement was to\nexpedite National Steel's receipt of its refund while\nprotecting the IRS's interests. It further held that the anti-\nretroactivity clause protects only those terms decided in the\nagreement. Nat'l Steel, 75 F.3d at 1151. The court\nconcluded that despite the document's references toS 212\nthe agreement did not specify the use of the section's then-\ncurrent refund-calculation criteria, noting that\"[h]ad\nNational Steel wanted to avoid the risk of a retroactive\nchange in law, it could have negotiated for a determination\n\n                               7\n\fthat its tax liability would be calculated in accordance with\nexisting law.\" Id. at 1152.\n\nIn this case, the parties do not dispute that the anti-\nretroactivity clause applies only to \"terms\" of the Agreement.3\nHowever, the IRS claims that because, as both the District\nCourt and the Seventh Circuit found, the S 212 refund\ncalculation is not a term of the Agreement, the clause does\nnot bar application of TAMRA's retroactive exclusion of\n1986 credits from the calculation of Bethlehem's refund.4\nBethlehem, on the other hand, contends that because this\ncourt considers extrinsic evidence in determining whether a\ncontract is ambiguous, we should not follow the National\nSteel decision which was made without the benefit of such\nevidence. The company asserts that the evidence in this\ncase proves that the parties intended that Bethlehem's\nrefund be calculated under the existing S 212, thereby\nmaking the method of calculation a term of the Agreement.\nAny other interpretation, the company contends, renders\nthe Agreement's anti-retroactivity clause meaningless.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Bethlehem does urge this court to give the anti-retroactivity clause\nspecial significance, asserting that the clause, which the IRS drafted\nunilaterally, varies from the agency's standard retroactivity language.\nSee App. at 34 (Form 906, January 1987) (\"This agreement is final and\nconclusive except: . . . if it relates to a tax period ending after the\ndate\nof this agreement, it is subject to any law, enacted after the agreement\ndate, that applies to that tax period.\"); see also 26 C.F.R. S 301.7121-\n1(c)(2) (2001) (\"[A] closing agreement with respect to a taxable period\nending subsequent to the date of the agreement is subject to any change\nin, or modification of, the law enacted subsequent to the date of the\nagreement and made applicable to such taxable period.\"); Rev. Proc. 68-\n16, 1968-1 C.B. 770, 796 (same).\n\n4. National Steel also found that the requirement that closing agreements\nhave high-level IRS approval would be undermined if courts considered\nthe testimony of IRS negotiators to alter the agreements' language, and\nthus held that courts \"must strive more mightily than would otherwise\nbe the case to make sense of [such] contract[s] without ordering a[n\nevidentiary] hearing.\" Nat'l Steel, 75 F.3d at 1150. The IRS urges this\ncourt to adopt the Seventh Circuit's determination that excessive\nconsideration of extrinsic evidence in interpreting closing agreements\nmay undermine the statutory requirement that closing agreements be\napproved by a high-level IRS authority. We need not reach this issue in\nlight of our disposition.\n\n                               8\n\fWe agree with the court in National Steel that the method\nof refund calculation is unambiguously not a term of the\nAgreement and is therefore not protected by the anti-\nretroactivity clause. Although we agree with the IRS that\nthere is no ambiguity, even if we were to hold that there\nwas, we would conclude that the extrinsic evidence of\nrecord reinforces this interpretation of the Agreement's\nplain language.\n\nA. The Refund-Calculation Method Is Not a Term\n       of the Agreement\n\nThe Closing Agreement, which by its title is expressly\nlimited to \"[s]pecific [m]atters,\" App. at 30, contains only\nthree substantive paragraphs describing terms agreed upon\nby the parties. Each of these provisions deals with\nprocedures pertaining to Bethlehem's receipt and\ninvestment of its S 212 refund, and the IRS's release and\nauditing of the refund. None of the three purports to set an\namount, or describe a calculation formula, for the refund,\nand these matters plainly do not constitute terms of the\nAgreement. Bethlehem cites the two references toS 212 in\nthe Agreement as evidence that the section's then-current\nmethod of refund calculation, which included 1986 credits,\nis a term of the Agreement. However, neither of the\nreferences purports to describe the method to be used in\ncalculating the refund.5\n\nOne reference, in the Agreement's first recital, states that\nBethlehem anticipates a tax overpayment in 1987 as a\nresult of S 212 and desires a quick release of such\noverpayment. This recital explains the purpose of the\nagreement, rather than defining a term agreed upon by the\nparties. It focuses on the promptness of the IRS's response\nto Bethlehem's anticipated refund claim rather than the\nsize or manner of calculating the refund. The reference to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The grammatical structure of the Closing Agreement certainly suggests\nthat the IRS took no position in that Agreement as to the applicability of\nthe method of calculation of the refund in S 212. Throughout the Closing\nAgreement it is Bethlehem, not the IRS, which is the subject of the\nclauses which reference S 212. The IRS retains a neutral position toward\nthe availability of any recovery, let alone a specific amount or means of\ncalculation.\n\n                               9\n\fS 212 merely acknowledges the statute precipitating the\nagreement and cannot reasonably be understood to provide\nfor a particular method of calculating the refund.\n\nThe IRS's guideline describing the proper form for closing\nagreements relating to specific matters states, in relevant\npart:\n\n       The identification of the parties is followed by one or\n       more WHEREAS clauses which serve to introduce the\n       subject matter of the agreement and state premises\n       upon which it is based. . . .\n\n       It is important to distinguish between matters which\n       are merely informative and explanatory and matters\n       which are being agreed upon. The former should be\n       segregated from the latter and should ordinarily be\n       reflected in the introductory recitals contained in the\n       WHEREAS clauses.\n\nRev. Proc. 68-16, 1968-1 C.B. 770, 779.6 This guideline\nfurther supports our conclusion that the Agreement's first\nreference to S 212 does not incorporate the section's refund-\ncalculation method into the contract as a matter\"agreed\nupon\" by the parties.\n\nThe second reference is in the second substantive\nprovision of the Agreement, which provides that Bethlehem\nmust reinvest \"the amount determined under\"S 212 within\nthree years of receiving the money. The company argues\nthat this phrase specifies the method for calculating the\nreinvestment amount and, therefore, the refund amount.\nHowever, the phrase is situated in a provision describing\nthe time and manner, rather than the amount, of\nreinvestment, belying this interpretation. Nonetheless,\nBethlehem contends that the actual effect of the\nreinvestment deadline in this case supports its position,\nstating that because it respected the three-year deadline, it\nreinvested its entire refund before the IRS disallowed the\nportion of the refund based on 1986 credits, with the result\nthat it reinvested more than the amount of its ultimate\nrefund.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The three substantive paragraphs of the Agreement are structured as\ndescribed in this guideline.\n\n                               10\n\fBethlehem argues that by imposing the three-year\nreinvestment deadline, the IRS bound itself to use the same\nmethod to calculate the refund as the company had used to\ncalculate the reinvestment obligation. This \"overinvestment\"\nclaim is not supported in the record and does not compel\nBethlehem's interpretation of the Agreement. Bethlehem\npoints to no evidence that it reinvested more under the\nAgreement than it otherwise planned to invest, or that it\ndid so before TAMRA was enacted, less than one year into\nthe reinvestment period. Moreover, Bethlehem undertook\nthe risk of overinvestment when it agreed to extend the\nIRS's period of limitations for challenging the refund past\nthe reinvestment deadline rather than negotiating for a\ndifferent timeline.\n\nIn fact, Bethlehem's overinvestment argument highlights\nthe fact that the Agreement's first substantive provision\nexpressly reserves the IRS's right to challenge the\ncompany's claimed refund should it be \"determined to be\nerroneous or excessive\" and extends the agency's statute of\nlimitations for such challenges. App. at 30. Along with the\nfinal substantive provision, requiring prompt release of the\nclaimed refund, this provision further demonstrates that\nthe parties intended that the Agreement would facilitate\nBethlehem's quick receipt of the funds while allowing the\nIRS ample time to audit the company's claim. It follows that\nthere was no reason why the Agreement would contain any\nterm detailing the anticipated refund's size or calculation.\nWe therefore agree with the IRS that the Closing Agreement\nwas not ambiguous and that it was entitled to summary\njudgment on its first motion.\n\nB. Extrinsic Evidence Reinforces the Agreement's\n       Unambiguous Meaning\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that either the Agreement's\nreferences to S 212 or the extrinsic evidence create an\nambiguity as to whether the parties meant to incorporate a\nrefund-calculation formula into the Agreement,\nconsideration of the extrinsic evidence submitted with the\nrenewed motions for summary judgment supports our\nreading of the document's plain language. The record\ndemonstrates clearly that the parties never discussed,\nmuch less negotiated, the method to be used for calculating\n\n                               11\n\fthe refund. In fact, there is evidence that the Steel\nCompanies, although aware of the discrepancy between the\nlanguage of the existing statute regarding 1986 credits and\nthe intent of Congress reflected in the Conference Report,\nanticipated that a second technical corrections bill would\nbe introduced in 1988. However, as part of a deliberate\nstrategy, they did not raise the issue of whether the 1986\ncredits would be included in calculating their refunds\nduring their negotiations with the IRS leading to the\nClosing Agreement. Donald McCambridge, Bethlehem's lead\nrepresentative in the IRS-Steel Companies negotiations,\nlater wrote:\n\n       As background material for the negotiations, we\n       provided the IRS with copies of both the statute and\n       the Conference Report. The IRS never raised a question\n       about the difference [regarding 1986 credits] and we\n       did not feel compelled to make a special effort to call it\n       to their attention. To this day I could not positively say\n       that the failure to raise the issue was due to ignorance\n       or acceptance of the fact that the statute is controlling.\n\nApp. at 161 (Letter from McCambridge to Harshman of\n5/2/91).\n\nBethlehem points out that the Steel Companies\nreferenced their intent to include 1986 credits in their\ncalculations in documents they gave the IRS, and notes\nthat the IRS did not challenge their definition of\"existing\ncarryforwards.\" However, this does not show that the\nparties reached an accord on the method of refund\ncalculation and agreed to make it a term of their limited\nAgreement. In fact, the references to the 1986 credits do\nnot even demonstrate that the Steel Companies subjectively\nunderstood their method of refund calculation to be a term\nof the Agreement, particularly in light of their deliberate\nfailure to address this issue during the negotiations leading\nup to the Agreement. As the court noted in National Steel,\n75 F.3d at 1152, had the Steel Companies wanted to avoid\nthe risk that an amendment would exclude 1986 credits,\nthey could have negotiated for an explicit term fixing the\nrefund-calculation formula.7 Bethlehem cites authority for\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. During such negotiations, the Steel Companies could also have\nbargained for an anti-retroactivity clause protecting the method-of-\n\n                               12\n\fthe proposition that one contracting party is bound by the\nother's intent if the first party knows or should know of this\nintent. See, e.g., Sunbury Textile Mills, Inc. v. Comm'r, 585\nF.2d 1190, 1195 (3d Cir. 1978) (citing 3 A. Corbin, Corbin\non Contracts S 543, at 140 (1960), and Emor, Inc. v. Cyprus\nMines Corp., 467 F.2d 770, 775 (3d Cir. 1972)). But in this\ncase, Bethlehem is not merely requesting that this court,\nlike the courts in Sunbury and Emor, interpret an existing\ncontract term according to the parties' subjective\nunderstanding of that term. Instead, it asks us to infer that\nthe parties subjectively intended (or that the IRS knew that\nBethlehem intended) the Agreement to include an\nadditional term not discussed in the document's\nsubstantive provisions. There is no basis for us to conclude\nthat the IRS knew that Bethlehem so intended. As for the\nSteel Companies, the evidence shows that at the time of\ntheir negotiations with the IRS, they were aware of the\npossibility of retroactive amendment in light of the\ndiscrepancy between the statutory language and the\nlegislative intent regarding treatment of 1986 credits, but\nchose not to discuss it.\n\nBethlehem contends that in addition to alerting the IRS\nto its intention to include the 1986 credits, the Claim Form\nprepared by the IRS incorporated this refund-calculation\nmethod into the Closing Agreement. The Claim Form was\ndrafted by the IRS and signed and submitted by Bethlehem\nas part of the same series of negotiations between the IRS\nand the Steel Companies as the Agreement. Pursuant to the\nAgreement, Bethlehem's submission of the Claim Form\ntriggered the IRS's prompt release of Bethlehem's refund.\nTherefore, Bethlehem contends that we must consider the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ncalculation term. Bethlehem makes much of the fact that the Steel\nCompanies did not negotiate for the anti-retroactivity clause, and that\nthe IRS added it to the Closing Agreement unilaterally. Perhaps the\ncompanies' failure to bargain for an anti-retroactivity clause was part of\ntheir strategy not to call to the agency's attention the 1986-credit\ndiscrepancy and the possibility of future technical corrections bills.\nHowever, this failure now undermines Bethlehem's argument that the\nparties understood the Agreement to fix permanently a particular refund-\ncalculation method.\n\n                               13\n\fClaim Form in interpreting the Agreement. See Williams v.\nMetzler, 132 F.3d 937, 947 (3d Cir. 1997) (\" `A writing is\ninterpreted as a whole, and all writings that are part of the\nsame transaction are interpreted together.' \") (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts S 202(2) (1981)). Because\nthe Claim Form refers to \"existing carryforwards as defined\nin [TRA S] 212(g)(2),\" App. at 36, the company asserts that\nconsideration of the form demonstrates that the refund-\ncalculation method was a term of the Agreement.\n\nConsideration of the Claim Form does not, however, alter\nour agreement with the District Court's finding that the\nClosing Agreement's overriding purpose was to delineate the\ntiming and procedures for distributing the Steel Companies'\nclaimed S 212 refunds promptly and did not address the\nsubstance of the refunds' amount or calculation. The\nClosing Agreement's requirement that the companies\nsubmit Claim Forms to trigger distribution of their claimed\nrefunds comports with TRA S 212(a)'s requirement that\neach company affirmatively elect to cash out its\ncarryforwards in order to receive such a refund. Moreover,\nthe Claim Form was not signed by the IRS. The parties'\ndecision to exclude the refund calculations from the body of\ntheir Agreement reinforces our understanding of this\ndocument as limited to the three enumerated terms\nexpressly described therein.\n\nBethlehem's remaining arguments, that the District\nCourt's interpretation of the Agreement is inappropriate\nbecause it deprives Bethlehem of any benefit of the\nAgreement and renders the anti-retroactivity clause\nmeaningless, see Arnold M. Diamond, Inc., 180 F.3d at 522\n(\" `[A]n interpretation which gives a[n] . . . effective meaning\nto all the terms is preferred to [one] which leaves a part . . .\nof no effect.' \") (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts\nS 203 (1981)), are unavailing. The Agreement expedited\nBethlehem's receipt of over $140 million.8 Although\nBethlehem argues that this does not constitute a benefit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. McCambridge testified at his deposition that the Steel Companies'\nprimary objective in their negotiations with the IRS was to accelerate the\nrelease of their claimed refunds, due to the time value of money. See\nApp. at 93-94.\n\n                               14\n\fbecause Congress intended the IRS to effectuate a quick\nrelease of the S 212 refunds, the TRA did not specify a\nprocedure or timeline for the refund. The Agreement did\nboth, and there was no guarantee that the IRS would\notherwise have released the money as promptly as it did in\nthe absence of more specific legislative guidance. 9 The\nclause prevents the application of retroactive amendments\naffecting the express terms of the agreement, such as the\nstatute of limitations for challenging the refund and the\nreinvestment deadline. The lack of such amendments in\nthis case does not obviate the effect of the clause.\n\nV.\n\nIn conclusion, the Closing Agreement's substantive\nprovisions discuss only the timeline for issuing, reinvesting,\nand challenging Bethlehem's S 212 refund, and the manner\nof reinvestment of the refund. The document never\nmentions the amount of the refund or the method for\nrefund calculation. In light of the Agreement's self-\nconsciously limited scope, its silence regarding these\nmatters unambiguously demonstrates that they were\nsimply not terms agreed upon by the parties. An\nexamination of the extrinsic evidence of record confirms\nthis interpretation of the Agreement's plain language.\n\nTherefore, we find as a matter of law that the\nAgreement's limited anti-retroactivity clause does not\nprotect Bethlehem from the retroactive TAMRA exclusion of\n1986 credits from the S 212 refund calculation and we will\naffirm the District Court's summary judgment rulings to\nthis effect.10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. For example, McCambridge's letter summarizing the Steel Companies'\nFebruary 1988 meeting with the IRS stated that \"[t]he first issue [the\nIRS] raised was that [it] did not think[it] had the authority to disburse\nfunds without passage of the technical corrections bill because the\nspecific refund procedure is contained only in the technical corrections\nbill, not in the original statute.\" App. at 77 (Letter from McCambridge to\nArnett of 2/5/88); see also App. at 104 (McCambridge Deposition).\n\n10. In response to inquiry by this court, both parties agree that the\nrecent filing by Bethlehem Steel for bankruptcy has no effect on this\nmatter.\n\n                                15\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               16\n\f",

Resolution of the issue\ndepends on whether an anti-retroactivity clause in the\nagreement prevents the IRS from applying retroactive\nlegislation, enacted after the parties' execution of the\nClosing Agreement, in determining Bethlehem's tax liability.\nThe District Court held that the language of the clause\nlimits its protection to \"terms\" of the agreement, and that\nthe amount of the cash-out and the method by which it\nwould be calculated were not \"terms\" of the agreement. The\nDistrict Court therefore granted summary judgment to the\nIRS. Bethlehem appeals.\n\nII.\n\nUnder the law applicable from 1976 to 1986, domestic\nmanufacturers could claim tax credits based on certain\nmodernization investments. If not fully used in the year\nearned, these credits could be \"carried forward\" for use in\nfuture years. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (\"TRA\")1 repealed\nthe investment credit for property placed in service after\nDecember 31, 1985, and reduced the value of unused\ncredits. One of various transition rules enacted in\nconjunction with the repeal provided a tax benefit for\nqualified domestic steel manufacturers, such as Bethlehem,\nwhich were in dire financial straits and unlikely to generate\nsufficient income to use their remaining tax credits.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085 (codified as amended in scattered\nsections of 26 U.S.C.).\n\n                               2\n\fUnder TRA S 212, the steel manufacturers could elect to\ntreat 50% of their unused credits (\"existing carryforwards\")\nas an income tax payment for the first taxable year after\nDecember 31, 1986, thereby enabling them to \"cash out\"\nthe credits through a \"refund\" for overpayment of taxes.\nBecause this benefit was intended to enable the qualified\ncompanies to modernize their operations, S 212(f) required\nthe companies to reinvest their refunds into their\nbusinesses, although the TRA did not set a reinvestment\ndeadline. Moreover, while the statute's definition of\n\"existing carryforwards\" included 1986 credits, see TRA\nS 212(g)(2), the Conference Report on the statute clearly\nstated Congress' intent to include credits only through\n1985, see 2 H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-841, at 65 (1986). The\nHouse of Representatives passed a bill in 1987 that would\nhave retroactively amended S 212 to exclude 1986 credits,\nbut the Senate never addressed that bill.\n\nMeanwhile, Bethlehem and other eligible steel companies\n(collectively, the \"Steel Companies\") anticipated large 1987\nrefunds as a result of S 212. In February and March, 1988,\na committee of the Steel Companies (including Bethlehem)\nmet with the IRS to discuss how to obtain the refunds prior\nto the actual filing (and auditing) of their 1987 returns. It\nwas not unusual for steel companies to obtain extensions\nfor filing their tax returns because of the complexity of their\nbusiness affairs. The Steel Companies wanted the IRS to\nissue the refunds on March 15, 1988, the statutory date of\ntheir \"overpayments,\" and there is legislative history that\nSenators interested in the bill intended that the cash-outs\nbe quickly released. See 132 Cong. Rec. S8269 (1986)\n(statements of Sens. Heinz and Packwood). The Steel\nCompanies initially proposed that the agency process the\nrefunds using an expedited procedure designed to adjust\noverpayment of estimated income taxes. The IRS rejected\nthis proposal, negotiating to ensure that it had time to\naudit the refunds and that the Steel Companies complied\nwith S 212's reinvestment mandate. In return for\nconcessions in these areas, the IRS agreed to issue the\nrefunds promptly upon receipt of the Steel Companies'\nclaims. To memorialize the parties' agreement, the IRS\ndrafted a \"Closing Agreement on Final Determination\n\n                               3\n\fCovering Specific Matters\" (\"Closing Agreement\") without\nsignificant input from the Steel Companies.\n\nOn March 9 and 11, 1988, respectively, Bethlehem and\nthe IRS signed the Closing Agreement. It provided:\n\n        WHEREAS, [Bethlehem ] anticipates an overpayment\n       of its federal income tax liability for its [1987] taxable\n       year . . . resulting from the application of [S] 212 of the\n       [TRA] and desires a quick release by the [IRS] of any\n       such overpayment; and\n\n        WHEREAS, [Bethlehem ] may be unable to file its\n       federal income tax return for [1987] . . . by its due date\n       determined without regard to any time to file extension.\n\n        NOW IT IS HEREBY DETERMINED AND AGREED for\n       federal income tax purposes that:\n\n       1) [Bethlehem ] agrees that the period of limitations\n       for the [IRS] to bring suit to recover any amount\n       of such overpayment claimed by [Bethlehem ]\n       that is determined to be erroneous or excessive\n       shall not expire prior to the expiration of the\n       period of limitations on assessment of tax . . .\n       with respect to [Bethlehem's] federal income tax\n       return for [1987] . . . .\n\n       2) [Bethlehem ] agrees that the amount determined\n       under [S] 212 of the [TRA] will be spent within 3\n       years of the date of the refund for reinvestment\n       in and modernization of its steel operations\n       through investment in modern plant and\n       equipment, research and development, and other\n       appropriate projects . . ., as required by [S] 212(f)\n       of the [TRA].\n\n       3) The [IRS] agrees to effect a prompt release of any\n       refund due upon the filing by [Bethlehem ] of the\n       election and claim for the quick release of\n       refund.\n\n        WHEREAS, the determinations set forth above are\n       hereby agreed to by the [IRS], and by [Bethlehem ],\n       including its successors and assigns.\n\n                               4\n\f        NOW THIS CLOSING AGREEMENT WITNESSETH,\n       that [Bethlehem ] and [the IRS] hereby mutually agree\n       that the determinations set forth above shall be final\n       and conclusive, subject, however, to reopening in the\n       event of fraud, malfeasance, or misrepresentation of\n       material fact; furthermore, no change or modification of\n       applicable statutes will render this agreement ineffective\n       with respect to the terms agreed to herein.\n\nApp. at 30-31 (emphasis added). It is conceded that the\n\"anti-retroactivity\" clause, underlined above,\"was never an\nissue\" in the IRS-Steel Companies meetings. App. at 126.\n\nThe IRS also drafted, again without significant input from\nthe Steel Companies, an \"Election and Claim for Quick\nRelease of Overpayment Resulting from the Application of\nSection 212 of the Tax Reform Act\" of 1986 (\"Claim Form\"),\nwhich the Steel Companies were to use to request their\nrefunds. App. at 36. The Claim Form referred to\"the\nelection required under [TRA S] 212,\" allowed the electing\ncompany to specify the percentage of \"existing\ncarryforwards as defined in [TRA S] 212(g)(2)\" to which its\nelection would apply, and required the company to list the\ncarryforwards supporting its refund calculation. App. at 36-\n37. On March 15, 1988, Bethlehem filed its Claim Form,\nelecting the S 212 cash-out, and claiming a $140,428,024\nrefund based on $280,856,047 of existing carryforwards. It\nexplicitly included its 1986 credits in its refund calculations\nwhich it attached to the form, as required. The IRS paid the\nclaimed refund on March 25, 1988.\n\nBethlehem filed its consolidated 1987 income tax return\non August 8, 1988. On November 10, Congress enacted the\nTechnical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988\n(\"TAMRA\").2 TAMRA S 1002(f)(5) amended TRA S 212 to\nexclude 1986 credits from the definition of \"existing\ncarryforwards\" used to calculate S 212 refunds, and\nS 1019(a) provided that this \"amendment . .. shall take\neffect as if included in the provision of the Reform Act to\nwhich [it] relates.\" Consequently, upon its audit of\nBethlehem's 1987 tax return, the IRS determined that the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Pub. L. No. 100-647, 102 Stat. 3342 (codified as amended in scattered\nsections of 26 U.S.C.).\n\n                               5\n\fcompany's 1986 credits, worth $11,381,450, should not\nhave been included in calculating the company'sS 212\nrefund. The IRS and Bethlehem entered into an agreement\nwhereby the company agreed to pay the resulting deficiency\nof $5,690,725 plus interest, for a total of $13,397,164, but\nreserved its right to claim a refund based on its purported\nright to include 1986 credits in its S 212 refund\ncalculations. Bethlehem paid the assessment and sought\nthe refund, which the IRS disallowed on April 9, 1998.\n\nIII.\n\nOn July 2, 1998, Bethlehem sued the IRS to recover the\nrefund, arguing that the Agreement's anti-retroactivity\nclause barred the application of TAMRA to exclude 1986\ncredits from the calculation of its S 212 refund. After\nsubmitting a stipulated record, the parties cross-moved for\nsummary judgment. The District Court denied both\nmotions, finding the Agreement ambiguous. After discovery,\nthe parties again cross-moved for summary judgment.\n\nOn August 7, 2000, the court granted the IRS's motion\nand denied Bethlehem's motion. See Bethlehem Steel Corp.\nv.

After\nconsidering extrinsic evidence, it found that the\nAgreement's overriding purpose was to expedite\nBethlehem's receipt of its refund, and that the parties\nnegotiated and agreed to provisions providing for: (1)\nprompt release of the refund, (2) an extension of the IRS's\nstatute of limitations for challenging the refund, and (3) a\ndeadline for Bethlehem's reinvestment of the refund.\nFinding that neither the amount nor the method of\ncalculating the refund were negotiated terms of the\nAgreement, the court held that they were not protected by\nthe Agreement's narrow anti-retroactivity clause.

See Bethlehem Steel Corp., 108 F. Supp.2d at\n453; Nat'l Steel, 75 F.3d at 1152. In National Steel, the\ncourt held that the purpose of the closing agreement was to\nexpedite National Steel's receipt of its refund while\nprotecting the IRS's interests. It further held that the anti-\nretroactivity clause protects only those terms decided in the\nagreement. Nat'l Steel, 75 F.3d at 1151. The court\nconcluded that despite the document's references toS 212\nthe agreement did not specify the use of the section's then-\ncurrent refund-calculation criteria, noting that\"[h]ad\nNational Steel wanted to avoid the risk of a retroactive\nchange in law, it could have negotiated for a determination\n\n                               7\n\fthat its tax liability would be calculated in accordance with\nexisting law.\" Id. at 1152.\n\nIn this case, the parties do not dispute that the anti-\nretroactivity clause applies only to \"terms\" of the Agreement.3\nHowever, the IRS claims that because, as both the District\nCourt and the Seventh Circuit found, the S 212 refund\ncalculation is not a term of the Agreement, the clause does\nnot bar application of TAMRA's retroactive exclusion of\n1986 credits from the calculation of Bethlehem's refund.4\nBethlehem, on the other hand, contends that because this\ncourt considers extrinsic evidence in determining whether a\ncontract is ambiguous, we should not follow the National\nSteel decision which was made without the benefit of such\nevidence. The company asserts that the evidence in this\ncase proves that the parties intended that Bethlehem's\nrefund be calculated under the existing S 212, thereby\nmaking the method of calculation a term of the Agreement.\nAny other interpretation, the company contends, renders\nthe Agreement's anti-retroactivity clause meaningless.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Bethlehem does urge this court to give the anti-retroactivity clause\nspecial significance, asserting that the clause, which the IRS drafted\nunilaterally, varies from the agency's standard retroactivity language.\nSee App. at 34 (Form 906, January 1987) (\"This agreement is final and\nconclusive except: . . . if it relates to a tax period ending after the\ndate\nof this agreement, it is subject to any law, enacted after the agreement\ndate, that applies to that tax period.\"); see also 26 C.F.R. S 301.7121-\n1(c)(2) (2001) (\"[A] closing agreement with respect to a taxable period\nending subsequent to the date of the agreement is subject to any change\nin, or modification of, the law enacted subsequent to the date of the\nagreement and made applicable to such taxable period.\"); Rev. Proc. 68-\n16, 1968-1 C.B. 770, 796 (same).\n\n4. National Steel also found that the requirement that closing agreements\nhave high-level IRS approval would be undermined if courts considered\nthe testimony of IRS negotiators to alter the agreements' language, and\nthus held that courts \"must strive more mightily than would otherwise\nbe the case to make sense of [such] contract[s] without ordering a[n\nevidentiary] hearing.\" Nat'l Steel, 75 F.3d at 1150. The IRS urges this\ncourt to adopt the Seventh Circuit's determination that excessive\nconsideration of extrinsic evidence in interpreting closing agreements\nmay undermine the statutory requirement that closing agreements be\napproved by a high-level IRS authority. We need not reach this issue in\nlight of our disposition.\n\n                               8\n\fWe agree with the court in National Steel that the method\nof refund calculation is unambiguously not a term of the\nAgreement and is therefore not protected by the anti-\nretroactivity clause. Although we agree with the IRS that\nthere is no ambiguity, even if we were to hold that there\nwas, we would conclude that the extrinsic evidence of\nrecord reinforces this interpretation of the Agreement's\nplain language.\n\nA. The Refund-Calculation Method Is Not a Term\n       of the Agreement\n\nThe Closing Agreement, which by its title is expressly\nlimited to \"[s]pecific [m]atters,\" App. at 30, contains only\nthree substantive paragraphs describing terms agreed upon\nby the parties. Each of these provisions deals with\nprocedures pertaining to Bethlehem's receipt and\ninvestment of its S 212 refund, and the IRS's release and\nauditing of the refund. None of the three purports to set an\namount, or describe a calculation formula, for the refund,\nand these matters plainly do not constitute terms of the\nAgreement. Bethlehem cites the two references toS 212 in\nthe Agreement as evidence that the section's then-current\nmethod of refund calculation, which included 1986 credits,\nis a term of the Agreement. However, neither of the\nreferences purports to describe the method to be used in\ncalculating the refund.5\n\nOne reference, in the Agreement's first recital, states that\nBethlehem anticipates a tax overpayment in 1987 as a\nresult of S 212 and desires a quick release of such\noverpayment. This recital explains the purpose of the\nagreement, rather than defining a term agreed upon by the\nparties. It focuses on the promptness of the IRS's response\nto Bethlehem's anticipated refund claim rather than the\nsize or manner of calculating the refund. The reference to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The grammatical structure of the Closing Agreement certainly suggests\nthat the IRS took no position in that Agreement as to the applicability of\nthe method of calculation of the refund in S 212. Throughout the Closing\nAgreement it is Bethlehem, not the IRS, which is the subject of the\nclauses which reference S 212. The IRS retains a neutral position toward\nthe availability of any recovery, let alone a specific amount or means of\ncalculation.\n\n                               9\n\fS 212 merely acknowledges the statute precipitating the\nagreement and cannot reasonably be understood to provide\nfor a particular method of calculating the refund.\n\nThe IRS's guideline describing the proper form for closing\nagreements relating to specific matters states, in relevant\npart:\n\n       The identification of the parties is followed by one or\n       more WHEREAS clauses which serve to introduce the\n       subject matter of the agreement and state premises\n       upon which it is based. . . .\n\n       It is important to distinguish between matters which\n       are merely informative and explanatory and matters\n       which are being agreed upon. The former should be\n       segregated from the latter and should ordinarily be\n       reflected in the introductory recitals contained in the\n       WHEREAS clauses.\n\nRev. Proc. 68-16, 1968-1 C.B. 770, 779.6 This guideline\nfurther supports our conclusion that the Agreement's first\nreference to S 212 does not incorporate the section's refund-\ncalculation method into the contract as a matter\"agreed\nupon\" by the parties.\n\nThe second reference is in the second substantive\nprovision of the Agreement, which provides that Bethlehem\nmust reinvest \"the amount determined under\"S 212 within\nthree years of receiving the money. The company argues\nthat this phrase specifies the method for calculating the\nreinvestment amount and, therefore, the refund amount.\nHowever, the phrase is situated in a provision describing\nthe time and manner, rather than the amount, of\nreinvestment, belying this interpretation. Nonetheless,\nBethlehem contends that the actual effect of the\nreinvestment deadline in this case supports its position,\nstating that because it respected the three-year deadline, it\nreinvested its entire refund before the IRS disallowed the\nportion of the refund based on 1986 credits, with the result\nthat it reinvested more than the amount of its ultimate\nrefund.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The three substantive paragraphs of the Agreement are structured as\ndescribed in this guideline.\n\n                               10\n\fBethlehem argues that by imposing the three-year\nreinvestment deadline, the IRS bound itself to use the same\nmethod to calculate the refund as the company had used to\ncalculate the reinvestment obligation. This \"overinvestment\"\nclaim is not supported in the record and does not compel\nBethlehem's interpretation of the Agreement. Bethlehem\npoints to no evidence that it reinvested more under the\nAgreement than it otherwise planned to invest, or that it\ndid so before TAMRA was enacted, less than one year into\nthe reinvestment period. Moreover, Bethlehem undertook\nthe risk of overinvestment when it agreed to extend the\nIRS's period of limitations for challenging the refund past\nthe reinvestment deadline rather than negotiating for a\ndifferent timeline.\n\nIn fact, Bethlehem's overinvestment argument highlights\nthe fact that the Agreement's first substantive provision\nexpressly reserves the IRS's right to challenge the\ncompany's claimed refund should it be \"determined to be\nerroneous or excessive\" and extends the agency's statute of\nlimitations for such challenges. App. at 30. Along with the\nfinal substantive provision, requiring prompt release of the\nclaimed refund, this provision further demonstrates that\nthe parties intended that the Agreement would facilitate\nBethlehem's quick receipt of the funds while allowing the\nIRS ample time to audit the company's claim. It follows that\nthere was no reason why the Agreement would contain any\nterm detailing the anticipated refund's size or calculation.\nWe therefore agree with the IRS that the Closing Agreement\nwas not ambiguous and that it was entitled to summary\njudgment on its first motion.\n\nB. Extrinsic Evidence Reinforces the Agreement's\n       Unambiguous Meaning\n\nEven assuming, arguendo, that either the Agreement's\nreferences to S 212 or the extrinsic evidence create an\nambiguity as to whether the parties meant to incorporate a\nrefund-calculation formula into the Agreement,\nconsideration of the extrinsic evidence submitted with the\nrenewed motions for summary judgment supports our\nreading of the document's plain language. The record\ndemonstrates clearly that the parties never discussed,\nmuch less negotiated, the method to be used for calculating\n\n                               11\n\fthe refund. In fact, there is evidence that the Steel\nCompanies, although aware of the discrepancy between the\nlanguage of the existing statute regarding 1986 credits and\nthe intent of Congress reflected in the Conference Report,\nanticipated that a second technical corrections bill would\nbe introduced in 1988. However, as part of a deliberate\nstrategy, they did not raise the issue of whether the 1986\ncredits would be included in calculating their refunds\nduring their negotiations with the IRS leading to the\nClosing Agreement. Donald McCambridge, Bethlehem's lead\nrepresentative in the IRS-Steel Companies negotiations,\nlater wrote:\n\n       As background material for the negotiations, we\n       provided the IRS with copies of both the statute and\n       the Conference Report. The IRS never raised a question\n       about the difference [regarding 1986 credits] and we\n       did not feel compelled to make a special effort to call it\n       to their attention. To this day I could not positively say\n       that the failure to raise the issue was due to ignorance\n       or acceptance of the fact that the statute is controlling.\n\nApp. at 161 (Letter from McCambridge to Harshman of\n5/2/91).\n\nBethlehem points out that the Steel Companies\nreferenced their intent to include 1986 credits in their\ncalculations in documents they gave the IRS, and notes\nthat the IRS did not challenge their definition of\"existing\ncarryforwards.\" However, this does not show that the\nparties reached an accord on the method of refund\ncalculation and agreed to make it a term of their limited\nAgreement. In fact, the references to the 1986 credits do\nnot even demonstrate that the Steel Companies subjectively\nunderstood their method of refund calculation to be a term\nof the Agreement, particularly in light of their deliberate\nfailure to address this issue during the negotiations leading\nup to the Agreement. As the court noted in National Steel,\n75 F.3d at 1152, had the Steel Companies wanted to avoid\nthe risk that an amendment would exclude 1986 credits,\nthey could have negotiated for an explicit term fixing the\nrefund-calculation formula.7 Bethlehem cites authority for\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. During such negotiations, the Steel Companies could also have\nbargained for an anti-retroactivity clause protecting the method-of-\n\n                               12\n\fthe proposition that one contracting party is bound by the\nother's intent if the first party knows or should know of this\nintent. See, e.g., Sunbury Textile Mills, Inc. v. Comm'r, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360391\"><a href=\"/opinion/360391/sunbury-textile-mills-inc-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195 (3d Cir. 1978) (citing 3 A. Corbin, Corbin\non Contracts S 543, at 140 (1960), and Emor, Inc. v. Cyprus\nMines Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"305865\"><a href=\"/opinion/305865/emor-inc-in-no-71-1671-and-delcalo-inc-v-cyprus-mines-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">770</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 775 (3d Cir. 1972)). But in this\ncase, Bethlehem is not merely requesting that this court,\nlike the courts in Sunbury and Emor, interpret an existing\ncontract term according to the parties' subjective\nunderstanding of that term. Instead, it asks us to infer that\nthe parties subjectively intended (or that the IRS knew that\nBethlehem intended) the Agreement to include an\nadditional term not discussed in the document's\nsubstantive provisions. There is no basis for us to conclude\nthat the IRS knew that Bethlehem so intended. As for the\nSteel Companies, the evidence shows that at the time of\ntheir negotiations with the IRS, they were aware of the\npossibility of retroactive amendment in light of the\ndiscrepancy between the statutory language and the\nlegislative intent regarding treatment of 1986 credits, but\nchose not to discuss it.\n\nBethlehem contends that in addition to alerting the IRS\nto its intention to include the 1986 credits, the Claim Form\nprepared by the IRS incorporated this refund-calculation\nmethod into the Closing Agreement. The Claim Form was\ndrafted by the IRS and signed and submitted by Bethlehem\nas part of the same series of negotiations between the IRS\nand the Steel Companies as the Agreement. Pursuant to the\nAgreement, Bethlehem's submission of the Claim Form\ntriggered the IRS's prompt release of Bethlehem's refund.\nTherefore, Bethlehem contends that we must consider the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ncalculation term. Bethlehem makes much of the fact that the Steel\nCompanies did not negotiate for the anti-retroactivity clause, and that\nthe IRS added it to the Closing Agreement unilaterally. Perhaps the\ncompanies' failure to bargain for an anti-retroactivity clause was part of\ntheir strategy not to call to the agency's attention the 1986-credit\ndiscrepancy and the possibility of future technical corrections bills.\nHowever, this failure now undermines Bethlehem's argument that the\nparties understood the Agreement to fix permanently a particular refund-\ncalculation method.\n\n                               13\n\fClaim Form in interpreting the Agreement. See Williams v.\nMetzler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749875\"><a href=\"/opinion/749875/bert-williams-v-cynthia-metzler-acting-secretary-us-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 947 (3d Cir. 1997) (\" `A writing is\ninterpreted as a whole, and all writings that are part of the\nsame transaction are interpreted together.' \") (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts S 202(2) (1981)). Because\nthe Claim Form refers to \"existing carryforwards as defined\nin [TRA S] 212(g)(2),\" App. at 36, the company asserts that\nconsideration of the form demonstrates that the refund-\ncalculation method was a term of the Agreement.\n\nConsideration of the Claim Form does not, however, alter\nour agreement with the District Court's finding that the\nClosing Agreement's overriding purpose was to delineate the\ntiming and procedures for distributing the Steel Companies'\nclaimed S 212 refunds promptly and did not address the\nsubstance of the refunds' amount or calculation. The\nClosing Agreement's requirement that the companies\nsubmit Claim Forms to trigger distribution of their claimed\nrefunds comports with TRA S 212(a)'s requirement that\neach company affirmatively elect to cash out its\ncarryforwards in order to receive such a refund. Moreover,\nthe Claim Form was not signed by the IRS. The parties'\ndecision to exclude the refund calculations from the body of\ntheir Agreement reinforces our understanding of this\ndocument as limited to the three enumerated terms\nexpressly described therein.\n\nBethlehem's remaining arguments, that the District\nCourt's interpretation of the Agreement is inappropriate\nbecause it deprives Bethlehem of any benefit of the\nAgreement and renders the anti-retroactivity clause\nmeaningless, see Arnold M. Diamond, Inc., 180 F.3d at 522\n(\" `[A]n interpretation which gives a[n] . . . effective meaning\nto all the terms is preferred to [one] which leaves a part . . .\nof no effect.' \") (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts\nS 203 (1981)), are unavailing. The Agreement expedited\nBethlehem's receipt of over $140 million.8 Although\nBethlehem argues that this does not constitute a benefit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. McCambridge testified at his deposition that the Steel Companies'\nprimary objective in their negotiations with the IRS was to accelerate the\nrelease of their claimed refunds, due to the time value of money. See\nApp. at 93-94.\n\n                               14\n\fbecause Congress intended the IRS to effectuate a quick\nrelease of the S 212 refunds, the TRA did not specify a\nprocedure or timeline for the refund. The Agreement did\nboth, and there was no guarantee that the IRS would\notherwise have released the money as promptly as it did in\nthe absence of more specific legislative guidance. 9 The\nclause prevents the application of retroactive amendments\naffecting the express terms of the agreement, such as the\nstatute of limitations for challenging the refund and the\nreinvestment deadline. The lack of such amendments in\nthis case does not obviate the effect of the clause.\n\nV.\n\nIn conclusion, the Closing Agreement's substantive\nprovisions discuss only the timeline for issuing, reinvesting,\nand challenging Bethlehem's S 212 refund, and the manner\nof reinvestment of the refund. The document never\nmentions the amount of the refund or the method for\nrefund calculation. In light of the Agreement's self-\nconsciously limited scope, its silence regarding these\nmatters unambiguously demonstrates that they were\nsimply not terms agreed upon by the parties. An\nexamination of the extrinsic evidence of record confirms\nthis interpretation of the Agreement's plain language.\n\nTherefore, we find as a matter of law that the\nAgreement's limited anti-retroactivity clause does not\nprotect Bethlehem from the retroactive TAMRA exclusion of\n1986 credits from the S 212 refund calculation and we will\naffirm the District Court's summary judgment rulings to\nthis effect.10\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. For example, McCambridge's letter summarizing the Steel Companies'\nFebruary 1988 meeting with the IRS stated that \"[t]he first issue [the\nIRS] raised was that [it] did not think[it] had the authority to disburse\nfunds without passage of the technical corrections bill because the\nspecific refund procedure is contained only in the technical corrections\nbill, not in the original statute.\" App. at 77 (Letter from McCambridge to\nArnett of 2/5/88); see also App. at 104 (McCambridge Deposition).\n\n10. In response to inquiry by this court, both parties agree that the\nrecent filing by Bethlehem Steel for bankruptcy has no effect on this\nmatter.\n\n                                15\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                               16\n\f</pre>",
