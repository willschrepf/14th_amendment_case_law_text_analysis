The original plaintiffs were the School District of Kansas City, Missouri, most of its Board of Education members, its School Superintendent, and five minor children who sued by their parents or next friends, all of whom are Kansas City, Missouri, Board of Education members.

These were: (1) denial of the motion to dismiss; (2) dismissal of the Kansas defendants; (3) denial of standing to KCMSD to litigate as party plaintiff, and (4) realignment of KCMSD as a defendant.  Issues two, three and four were presented in appellants' petition for leave to appeal, denied by this court on November 2, 1978.  Our unpublished order stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>The applications for leave to take interlocutory appeals filed herein are denied.

The other two issues raised are closely related to the latter ruling.  They are: (1) whether because of the conflict of interest created by that ruling, the plaintiff-students must obtain new counsel; and (2) whether their present next friends must either resign from the Kansas City, Missouri, Board of Education or be replaced in the litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prior denial of permission to appeal these interlocutory orders pursuant to the district court's section 1292(b) certification precludes a later appeal of the same rulings as final orders under section 1291.  Our prior order reveals that the rulings presently being appealed were clearly considered interlocutory or non-final.  The Supreme Court recently indicated that the primary vehicle for prompt review of non-final orders is 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b).  Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2461, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).  In its prior denial of leave to appeal pursuant to the section 1292(b) certification, in effect this court held that it did not find \"exceptional circumstances (which) justify a departure from the basic policy of postponing appellate review until after the entry of a final judgment.\"  Id. at 2461, Quoting from Fisons Ltd. v.

No Rule 54(b) finding was made by the district court, and this court refused a section 1292 appeal.
