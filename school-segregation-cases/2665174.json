What was the purpose of the enhanced sentence for drug sales\n\nnear schools? It was clearly to create drug-free zones in areas with a high density of\n\nchildren.2 What was the purpose of the procedural methodology enacted therewith?\n\nTo ensure the enhanced penalties were respected and enforced.

The initial\n\nquestion asked by § 1925 is “what would the legislature have done in the absence of the\n\nvoid provisions?” That is, would the legislature still want enhanced penalties for drug\n\nsales near our schools? Obviously it would — that was the whole purpose of the statute\n\nin the first place. It is the manifest goal. The procedure to achieve it was not the goal;\n\nthe procedure, if anything, reinforced the legislative desire to ensure the increased\n\npenalties were not pushed aside.\n\n      The majority suggests we cannot presume the legislature would have enacted the\n\nsubstantive provisions absent the procedural provisions, as it had the alternative of\n\nenhanced sentencing guidelines and chose another course. See Majority Slip Op., at 24\n\nn.5. Abjuring the general discretionary nature of sentencing guidelines, the legislature\n\n2 See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dixon, 53 A.3d 839, 844 (Pa.

Campbell,\n758 A.2d 1231, 1237 (Pa.

Does this reflect a desire to assure the\n\nsubstance is obeyed, or a desire to elevate process over substance?              Establishing\n\nsentencing guidelines would not ensure the imposition of a minimum sentence — a\n\nsituation that the General Assembly repeatedly indicated it wanted to prevent. See 18\n\nPa.C.S. § 6317(a) (establishing minimum sentence “notwithstanding any other provision\n\nof this title, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act or statute to the\n\ncontrary”); id., § 6317(c) (“Sentencing guidelines C shall not supersede the mandatory\n\nsentences provided in this section.”); id. (“There shall be no authority for a court to impose\n\non a defendant to which this section is applicable a lesser sentence than provided for in\n\nsubsection (a)[.]”).\n\n       In other words, the legislature wanted to remove any discretion concerning the\n\nminimum sentence. To propose it would have reinserted discretion into the equation\n\nsimply because Alleyne renders the procedural provisions infirm suggests the General\n\nAssembly “would want those ‘possessing a firearm while trafficking drugs[]’ to serve\n\nhigher sentences if it can be found by a judge by a preponderance, but not if the element\n\nis ... found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.” Commonwealth v. Newman, 99 A.3d\n\n86, 106 (Pa. Super. 2014) (en banc) (Mundy, J., concurring) (alteration in original).\n\nRespectfully, such a conclusion is absurd.        See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1).         Given the\n\nlegislature’s repeated references for the mandatory minimum to trump any provision to\n\nthe contrary, common sense tells us we can safely presume it would have enacted the\n\n\n\n\n                               [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 3\n\fsubstantive provisions absent the statute’s procedural language, had it been prescient\n\nenough to anticipate the Alleyne decision.3\n\n       As for the second exception, the remaining provisions still effectuate the legislative\n\nintent of establishing drug-free school zones. See 18 Pa.C.S. § 6317. The majority\n\nstates special verdicts would not cure § 6317’s notice and appeal provisions, id., § 6317\n\n(b), (d). See Majority Slip Op., at 19. Yet, as found by the majority, those provisions are\n\nper se infirm under Alleyne. See id., at 16-17.\n\n       Citing Commonwealth v. Samuel, 961 A.2d 57 (Pa. 2008), the majority\n\nemphasizes Samuel’s discussion of the legislative intent underlying a similar mandatory\n\nminimum statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9714. However, I find Commonwealth v. Belak, 825 A.2d\n\n1252 (Pa. 2003), more analogous to the instant matter because it addressed § 9714’s\n\nseverability, rather than whether the facts constituted a “crime of violence” under § 9714.\n\nExamining the second severability exception in Belak, we stated: “In enacting section\n\n9714, the legislature sought to punish violent recidivists, and [the valid provision] can\n\naccomplish that goal without reference to the invalid [provision].” Id., at 1257. I would\n\nemploy a similar approach here, focusing on the General Assembly’s intent to create\n\n\n\n3 The majority would make much of the legislature not wanting enhancement to create a\nnew crime or add an element to the crime. I cannot subscribe to the notion that this is a\n“critical statement of the legislature’s intention[.]” Majority Slip Op., at 25 n.6.\nRespectfully, those provisions are about process, not substance.\n\nWhat the legislature wanted was a result, and it tried to accomplish it by a process later\nheld to be violative of the federal constitution. But the process it enacted was not the aim\nof the statute; that process was to facilitate achieving the manifest aim, which is\nsubstantive. The intent of the legislature was not to pass a law such that it does not\ncreate a new crime or element. These provisions to avoid additional hurdles to the\nstatute’s true purpose — these were not provisions that themselves had anything to do\nwith drug-free school zones, which was the purpose of the law. This is why they are\nseverable, not reasons why they are not.\n\n\n\n                              [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 4\n\fdrug-free zones in youth-centric areas — an intent which the substantive provisions can\n\nstill effectuate.\n\n       The majority further notes Samuel’s negative discussion of special verdicts, see\n\nSamuel, at 64, remarking that the proposed amendment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 648, which\n\nwould standardize the use of special verdicts for Alleyne purposes, is “tangential” to a\n\nseverability analysis.   Majority Slip Op., at 21 n.4.      A closer examination of the\n\nCommittee Report reveals using special verdicts to comply with Alleyne has become\n\n“‘commonplace.’”     Commonwealth’s Brief, at 38 (citation omitted).     The proposed\n\namendment would not create a new process — a process already exists. Hence, as the\n\namendment aims to clarify, not create, a process that effectuates § 6317’s intent, I\n\ndisagree that the amendment is tangential to the question of severability. As for the\n\nmajority’s reliance on Samuel’s discussion of special verdicts, we must remember\n\nSamuel cited a footnote from a 40-year-old plurality decision for the proposition that\n\nspecial verdicts are “universally condemned” within the criminal context. Samuel, at 64\n\n(citing Commonwealth v. Campana, 304 A.2d 432, 438 n.27 (Pa. 1973) (plurality\n\nopinion)). As Samuel was decided pre-Alleyne, I do not find its discussion of special\n\nverdicts convincing or dispositive. See Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 39 A.3d 977, 988 (Pa.\n\n2012) (Saylor, J., concurring) (citation omitted) (questioning policy of categorically\n\nprohibiting special verdicts in criminal context).\n\n       Finally, the majority distinguishes the present case from Commonwealth v.\n\nMockaitis, 834 A.2d 488 (Pa. 2003), wherein we concluded the second severability\n\nexception did not apply because there was a pre-existing process, i.e., seeking\n\nrestoration of driving privileges from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, to\n\neffectuate the legislative intent of preventing DUI recidivists from operating a vehicle\n\nwithout a limited license. Id., at 502-03. At the outset, this rationale seems sound;\n\n\n\n\n                               [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 5\n\fhowever, citing to other provisions within the Vehicle Code, we further stated in Mockaitis\n\nthat “enforcement of the legislative purpose will still occur in the ordinary course of\n\nenforcement[.]” Id., at 503 (citations omitted). I see no difference here. Execution of\n\nthe legislative purpose to develop drug-free school zones by imposing a mandatory\n\ntwo-year minimum would still occur in an ordinary manner, i.e., by utilizing our existing\n\nRules — the execution of which does not require the creation of a new procedural\n\nframework. See Newman, at 105 (observing numerous criminal statutes are executed in\n\nordinary manner despite absence of proof-of-sentencing mechanism).\n\n      Again, the law asks two straightforward questions when considering severability:\n\nwhat would the legislature have done in the absence of the void provisions, and can the\n\nremaining provisions effectuate the General Assembly’s intent? Would the legislature\n\nhave wanted increased school-zone penalties if its procedural plan was void? Of course\n\nit would — the procedure was the tail, not the dog. Can the valid portion of the statute\n\neffectuate that intent? A procedure that complies with Alleyne is simple, in place, and\n\nwould achieve the legislative purpose. Accordingly, I would hold the invalid provisions\n\nare severable, and respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                              [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 6\n\f",

I cannot subscribe to the notion that this is a\n“critical statement of the legislature’s intention[.]” Majority Slip Op., at 25 n.6.\nRespectfully, those provisions are about process, not substance.\n\nWhat the legislature wanted was a result, and it tried to accomplish it by a process later\nheld to be violative of the federal constitution. But the process it enacted was not the aim\nof the statute; that process was to facilitate achieving the manifest aim, which is\nsubstantive. The intent of the legislature was not to pass a law such that it does not\ncreate a new crime or element. These provisions to avoid additional hurdles to the\nstatute’s true purpose — these were not provisions that themselves had anything to do\nwith drug-free school zones, which was the purpose of the law. This is why they are\nseverable, not reasons why they are not.\n\n\n\n                              [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 4\n\fdrug-free zones in youth-centric areas — an intent which the substantive provisions can\n\nstill effectuate.\n\n       The majority further notes Samuel’s negative discussion of special verdicts, see\n\nSamuel, at 64, remarking that the proposed amendment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 648, which\n\nwould standardize the use of special verdicts for Alleyne purposes, is “tangential” to a\n\nseverability analysis.   Majority Slip Op., at 21 n.4.      A closer examination of the\n\nCommittee Report reveals using special verdicts to comply with Alleyne has become\n\n“‘commonplace.’”     Commonwealth’s Brief, at 38 (citation omitted).     The proposed\n\namendment would not create a new process — a process already exists. Hence, as the\n\namendment aims to clarify, not create, a process that effectuates § 6317’s intent, I\n\ndisagree that the amendment is tangential to the question of severability. As for the\n\nmajority’s reliance on Samuel’s discussion of special verdicts, we must remember\n\nSamuel cited a footnote from a 40-year-old plurality decision for the proposition that\n\nspecial verdicts are “universally condemned” within the criminal context. Samuel, at 64\n\n(citing Commonwealth v. Campana, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 438 n.27 (Pa. 1973) (plurality\n\nopinion)). As Samuel was decided pre-Alleyne, I do not find its discussion of special\n\nverdicts convincing or dispositive. See Commonwealth v. Jacobs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2293982\"><a href=\"/opinion/2293982/com-v-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 988 (Pa.\n\n2012) (Saylor, J., concurring) (citation omitted) (questioning policy of categorically\n\nprohibiting special verdicts in criminal context).\n\n       Finally, the majority distinguishes the present case from Commonwealth v.\n\nMockaitis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155193/com-v-mockaitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Pa. 2003), wherein we concluded the second severability\n\nexception did not apply because there was a pre-existing process, i.e., seeking\n\nrestoration of driving privileges from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, to\n\neffectuate the legislative intent of preventing DUI recidivists from operating a vehicle\n\nwithout a limited license. Id., at 502-03. At the outset, this rationale seems sound;\n\n\n\n\n                               [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 5\n\fhowever, citing to other provisions within the Vehicle Code, we further stated in Mockaitis\n\nthat “enforcement of the legislative purpose will still occur in the ordinary course of\n\nenforcement[.]” Id., at 503 (citations omitted). I see no difference here. Execution of\n\nthe legislative purpose to develop drug-free school zones by imposing a mandatory\n\ntwo-year minimum would still occur in an ordinary manner, i.e., by utilizing our existing\n\nRules — the execution of which does not require the creation of a new procedural\n\nframework. See Newman, at 105 (observing numerous criminal statutes are executed in\n\nordinary manner despite absence of proof-of-sentencing mechanism).\n\n      Again, the law asks two straightforward questions when considering severability:\n\nwhat would the legislature have done in the absence of the void provisions, and can the\n\nremaining provisions effectuate the General Assembly’s intent? Would the legislature\n\nhave wanted increased school-zone penalties if its procedural plan was void? Of course\n\nit would — the procedure was the tail, not the dog. Can the valid portion of the statute\n\neffectuate that intent? A procedure that complies with Alleyne is simple, in place, and\n\nwould achieve the legislative purpose. Accordingly, I would hold the invalid provisions\n\nare severable, and respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                              [J-78-2014] [MO: Todd, J.] - 6\n\f</pre>",
