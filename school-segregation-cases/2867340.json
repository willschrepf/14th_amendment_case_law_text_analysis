In that regard, the specific\n\nissue we must decide is whether general allegations of\n\nembarrassment and injury to professional reputations and client\n\nrelationships satisfies the \"good cause\" requirement for the\n\nissuance of an umbrella protective order pursuant to our recent\n\ndecision in Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772 (3d Cir.\n\n1994).   The law firm and its client assert that they will be\n\nunable to rectify the harm to their reputations and client\n\nrelationships if the law firm's privileged documents are publicly\n\ndisseminated.\n\n           We find that although they have established that there\n\nare no alternative avenues of appeal for these discovery orders,\n\nthe law firm and the client trust company have failed to\n\nestablish their clear and indisputable right to the writ.     They\n\nfailed to establish \"good cause\" for the protection of all of the\n\nlaw firm's file documents pursuant to the confidentiality\n\nagreement.   Nor have they demonstrated that the district court\n\nerred in determining that the scope of the client's waiver of the\n\nattorney-client privilege, by injecting the client's reliance on\n\fadvice of counsel as an issue in the underlying action, extended\n\nto the entire transaction, including back-up documents.\n\n          Accordingly, we decline to issue the requested writs.\n\f                                I.\n\n           Glenmede Trust Company (\"Glenmede\") is a Pennsylvania\n\ntrust company that serves as the trustee for several charitable\n\ntrusts, including the Pew Charitable Trusts.1   Glenmede also\n\nserves as a trustee for a number of private trusts and acts as an\n\ninvestment advisor pursuant to a written contract for other\n\nclients.   B. Ray Thompson, Jr., several members of his family2\n\nand the trustees3 of five trusts established by B. Ray Thompson,\n\nSr. for the benefit of his five grandchildren (collectively \"the\n\nThompson Family\") were investment advisory clients of Glenmede.\n\nPrior to September 11, 1990, both the Pew Charitable Trusts and\n\nthe Thompson family held substantial shares of Oryx Energy\n\nCompany stock; the Pew family's Oryx holdings totalled in excess\n\nof 25 million shares and the Thompson family's Oryx holdings\n\ntotalled approximately 2.9 million shares.   In mid-1990, Glenmede\n\nbroached, with Oryx management, the subject of a direct buy-back\n\nof Oryx shares held by the Pew Charitable Trusts.   Oryx was\n\nwilling to repurchase a maximum of 18 million shares at a premium\n\nprice per share but requested that buy-back discussions be kept\n\n1\n .        The Pew Charitable Trusts are comprised of the Pew\nMemorial Trust, the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust, the Mabel Pew\nMyrin Trust, the Trust under Paragraph 9 of the Will of J. N.\nPew, Jr., and the Trust under the Will of Ethel Pew.\n2\n .        These include B. Ray Thompson's wife, Juanne J.\nThompson, and his five children, Adella S. Thompson, Sarah\nThompson Tarver, Rebekah L. Thompson, Catherine V. Thompson and\nB. Ray Thompson, III.\n3\n .        The trustees are B. Ray Thompson, Jr., Juanne J.\nThompson and Dale A. Keasling.\n\fconfidential.   Given the limitations on the buy-back, Glenmede\n\nconsulted its counsel, Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz, as to whether\n\nthe Oryx transaction could be extended to include Glenmede's\n\nprivate trust and investment advisory clients.4\n\n          Pepper Hamilton issued an Opinion Letter dated\n\nSeptember 6, 1990 advising Glenmede that the buy-back transaction\n\ncould not be structured to include private clients of Glenmede as\n\nto do so may violate Internal Revenue Code prohibitions on\n\nprivate foundations.5   Pepper Hamilton further advised Glenmede\n\nthat it could not notify its private clients of the buy-back\n\nnegotiations between Oryx and Glenmede acting in its capacity as\n\ntrustee of the Pew Charitable Trusts.   On September 11, 1990,\n\nOryx repurchased through Glenmede 18 million of its common shares\n\nheld by the Pew Charitable Trusts and converted the remaining 7.3\n\nmillion common shares held by the Pew Charitable Trusts to\n\nconvertible preferred shares.   Allegedly, based on the Opinion\n\nLetter from Pepper Hamilton, Glenmede excluded its private\n\nclients with holdings of Oryx stock from the buy-back\ntransaction.\n\n4\n .        Pepper Hamilton had a long-standing relationship with\nGlenmede and the Pew family. It incorporated Glenmede in 1956,\ndrafted the trust instruments for the Pew charitable trusts\nadministered by Glenmede, and attended all meetings of Glenmede's\nBoard of Directors. A partner of Pepper Hamilton always served\nas the secretary and a board member of Glenmede.\n5\n .        The Opinion Letter contained Pepper Hamilton's legal\n\"opinion concerning the inclusion of certain private trusts and\nestates in transactions which may be undertaken by the Glenmede\nTrust Company on behalf of the charitable trusts for which it is\ntrustee.\"\n\f          In September of 1992, the Thompson family brought an\n\naction against Glenmede, its parent Glenmede Corporation, a\n\nnumber of Glenmede officers and directors and the Chairman and\n\nCEO of Oryx, who was dismissed from this action, asserting, inter\n\nalia, claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, breach of\n\ncontract, and negligence, all allegedly arising from Glenmede's\n\nrole in the September 11, 1990 buy-back transaction, in which\n\nOryx repurchased 18 million of its shares from Glenmede as\n\ntrustee of the Pew Charitable Trusts.   Glenmede raised as its\n\nFourteenth affirmative defense to these charges that it \"was\n\nadvised by counsel that it was legally precluded by Internal\n\nRevenue Code prohibitions from including Oryx shares held by\n\nother accounts in the repurchase transaction.\"\n\n          Glenmede concedes that the impact of placing at issue\n\nits reliance on advice of counsel was a waiver of the attorney-\n\nclient privilege limited to the subject matter placed at issue.\n\nGlenmede admitted only to a waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege relating to the subject matter of the Opinion Letter,\n\nwhich it submits is broader than tax advice which is the primary\n\nsubject of the Opinion Letter, but narrower than the totality of\n\nthe advice rendered regarding the buy-back transaction.6    In\n\naccordance with its position, Glenmede produced the Pepper\n\nHamilton Opinion Letter and a draft Opinion Letter in response to\n\ndiscovery requests served by the Thompson family.\n6\n .        Glenmede admitted at oral argument that the waiver was\nbroader than tax advice but narrower than the entire transaction.\nGlenmede, however, did not offer further specificity regarding\nthe scope of its waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\f          In response to the Thompson family's concern regarding\n\nthe production of financial records, the parties stipulated to a\n\n\"Confidentiality Order\" restricting the disclosure of documents\n\nto be produced and establishing measures to maintain\n\nconfidentiality pending an appeal from final judgment.   As\n\nevidenced by the terms of the confidentiality agreement, the\n\nparties contemplated the wholesale adoption of that agreement by\n\nthe district court.   Although it was filed with the district\n\ncourt for approval, it was never endorsed in an order of court.\n\nNevertheless, the parties complied with its terms, including the\n\nfiling of pleadings under seal.\n\n          On July 30, 1993, the Thompson family served a subpoena\n\nduces tecum on Pepper Hamilton, requesting its entire file\n\nconcerning services performed for Glenmede in connection with the\n\nbuy-back transaction.   Pepper Hamilton and Glenmede objected to\n\nthe production of Pepper Hamilton's file on the basis of the\n\nattorney-client privilege.   On October 18, 1993, the Thompson\n\nfamily filed a motion to compel the production of the file,\n\narguing that Glenmede waived the attorney-client privilege\n\nbecause it raised reliance on advice of counsel pertaining to the\n\nbuy-back transaction as an affirmative defense to the Thompson\n\nfamily's claims.   The Thompson family further contended that\n\nGlenmede's concern regarding the production of Pepper Hamilton's\n\nfile was unwarranted given the protection afforded by the\n\nconfidentiality agreement to which the parties stipulated.\n\n          By Memorandum and Order dated December 14, 1993, the\n\ndistrict court granted the Thompson family's motion to compel,\n\fconcluding that Glenmede waived its attorney-client privilege\n\nconcerning all communications, whether written or oral, to or\n\nfrom counsel, regarding the buy-back transaction.    The district\n\ncourt ordered that Pepper Hamilton produce its entire file for\n\nservices performed on behalf of Glenmede pertaining to the buy-\n\nback transaction, including all back-up documents to the Opinion\n\nLetter.   Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton moved for reconsideration\n\nof that Memorandum and Order, challenging the district court's\n\nconclusion that their invocation of the defense of reliance on\n\nadvice of counsel resulted in a waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege encompassing all services Pepper Hamilton performed in\n\nconnection with the buy-back transaction.7    Glenmede asserted\n\nthat its waiver was limited to tax advice embodied in the Opinion\n\nLetter.   By Memorandum and Order dated April 8, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court rejected Glenmede's motion for reconsideration on\n\nthe basis that the Opinion Letter discussed a number of issues in\n\naddition to tax advice, including insider trading and the\n\nfinancial ramifications of the transaction.         The district\n\ncourt also concluded that Pepper Hamilton's involvement in\n\nstructuring and closing the transaction required the production\n\nof back-up documents to the Opinion Letter to permit the Thompson\n\nfamily to analyze the reasonableness of Glenmede's reliance on\n\nthe advice of counsel.\n\n\n\n7\n .        At no time did Pepper Hamilton and/or Glenmede seek an\nin camera inspection of the file documents they sought to\npreclude from discovery.\n\f            Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton did not seek a writ of\n\nmandamus for immediate relief from the district court's orders\n\ncompelling the production of documents; they opted to defer\n\nappellate review of the district court's rulings until final\n\njudgment.    Instead, Pepper Hamilton produced in excess of 13,000\n\ndocuments in compliance with the district court's orders.\n\n            On June 20, 1994, Glenmede and the other defendants\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment under seal, attaching several\n\nPepper Hamilton file documents for which the attorney-client\n\nprivilege had been asserted but deemed waived by the district\n\ncourt.   On June 27, 1994, the Thompson family challenged the\n\n\"confidential\" designation of the Pepper Hamilton file documents\n\nand notified Glenmede of their intent to treat them as non-\n\nconfidential.8   On July 18, 1994, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton\n\nmoved for a Protective Order objecting to the Thompson family's\n\nwholesale challenge to the confidentiality of the documents.      The\n\n\n\n8\n .        The confidentiality agreement provided a mechanism for\nchallenging the designation of documents as \"confidential\" --\nprovide notification to the producing party of challenge to\nconfidentiality, the parties confer in an attempt to resolve the\nchallenge and, if no agreement can be reached, seek court\nintervention. The Thompson family mounted this challenge despite\ntheir representations to the district court that Glenmede and\nPepper Hamilton's concerns regarding public disclosure were\nunwarranted in light of the protection afforded by the stipulated\nconfidentiality agreement. Given our expectation that parties\noperate in good faith during discovery, we note that this\nchallenge closely followed our decision in Pansy v. Borough of\nStroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772 (3d Cir. May 2, 1994), regarding the\nimpropriety of the issuance of broad confidentiality orders,\nwhich signaled a shift from the previous practice of judicial\nendorsement of such stipulations.\n\fThompson family cross-moved to unseal the summary judgment\n\ndocuments filed under seal by Glenmede and the other defendants.\n\n          On October 21, 1994, the district court heard arguments\n\non the pending motions.9   It directed the parties to negotiate\n\nthe issues raised in the motion for protective order and to\n\npresent a motion for the confidential treatment of particular\n\ndocuments or categories of documents.   Glenmede, Pepper Hamilton\n\nand the Thompson family, however, were unable to reach an\n\nagreement regarding the confidential status of the Pepper\n\nHamilton file documents.   By Memorandum and Order dated November\n\n22, 1994, the district court granted the Thompson family's motion\n\nto amend the complaint to assert claims against individual Pepper\n\nHamilton attorneys, quoting from a number of the Pepper Hamilton\n\nfile documents.   By Memorandum and Order dated November 29, 1994,\n\nthe district court denied Glenmede and the other defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n          On November 30, 1994, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton\n\nfiled an emergency motion to seal court records and for\n\nprotective order, seeking to seal both the district court's\n\nNovember 22, 1994 Memorandum and Order and the October 21, 1994\n\nhearing transcript, pending consideration of their motion for\n\nprotective order to keep the Pepper Hamilton documents\n\n\n9\n .        The motions included Glenmede and the other defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment, Glenmede's motion for protective\norder and the Thompson family's motion to add Pepper Hamilton\nattorneys as defendants on the basis of information culled from\nthe Pepper Hamilton file documents, a motion to compel the\nproduction of documents and a motion to unseal the record.\n\fconfidential and for use only in these proceedings.    By\n\nMemorandum and Order dated December 2, 1994, the district court\n\ndenied Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's initial motion for\n\nprotective order and granted the Thompson family's motion to\n\nunseal the record.10   The district court determined that the\n\nconfidentiality agreement did not satisfy Pansy's \"good cause\"\n\nrequirement nor did Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton establish that\n\ndisclosure of the Pepper Hamilton documents would cause them a\n\ndefined and serious harm.\n\n            On December 13, 1994, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton\n\nfiled this petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district\n\ncourt to vacate and reverse its December 14, 1993 and April 8,\n\n1994 Memoranda and Orders compelling the production of the Pepper\n\nHamilton file documents and its December 2, 1994 order denying\n\nconfidentiality protection for those file documents.    In\n\naddition, they seek a writ directing the district court:     to\n\nplace under seal its November 22 and 29, 1994 Memoranda and\n\nOrders, the October 21, 1994 hearing transcript and all briefs\n\nand pleadings that reference the Pepper Hamilton file documents;\n\nto remove all references to those Memoranda and Orders from all\n\npublic access computer databases and district court records; and\n\nto order that the Memoranda and Orders not be published in any\n\nreporter.    Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton contend that the district\n\n\n10\n .        The district court did not dispose of Glenmede and\nPepper Hamilton's emergency motion to seal court records and for\nprotective order until January 12, 1995 when it issued a\nMemorandum and Order denying the unopposed motion.\n\fcourt's denial of the protective order has revealed the Pepper\n\nHamilton file documents to the public, which cannot be remedied\n\non appeal from final judgment.    The public dissemination of the\n\nPepper Hamilton documents is the harm sought to be averted via\n\nthis mandamus petition.\n\n\n\n                                 II.\n\n            This is an appeal from discovery orders which are not\n\nappealable as final decisions within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291.    See Haines v. Liggett Group Inc., 975 F.2d 81 (3d Cir.\n\n1992).    Our jurisdiction is premised upon the All Writs Act,\n\nwhich provides that the federal courts \"may issue all writs\n\nnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions\n\nand agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\"    28 U.S.C.A.\n\n§ 1651(a) (West 1994).    The issuance of the writ must aid some\n\npresent or potential exercise of appellate jurisdiction.     See\n\nWestinghouse v. Republic of the Philippines, 951 F.2d 1414, 1422\n\n(3d Cir. 1991).    Since this diversity action is potentially\n\nwithin our appellate jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction to\n\nconsider the petition for a writ of mandamus.\n\n            Nonetheless, our writ power should be invoked only in\n\nextraordinary situations, see Kerr v. United States Dist. Court\nfor Northern Dist. of California, 426 U.S. 394, 402 (1976), i.e.,\n\nonly in limited circumstances where a party seeking issuance has\n\nno other adequate means to attain the desired relief and\n\nestablishes that the right to the writ is clear and indisputable.\n\fHaines, 975 F.2d at 89.   Once these prerequisites are met, the\n\nissuance of the writ is a matter of discretion.   Id.\n\n          Although mandamus is an appropriate means of immediate\n\nappellate review of orders compelling the production of documents\n\nclaimed to be protected by privilege or other confidentiality\n\ninterest, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton chose not to seek a writ\n\nof mandamus to prevent the production of the privileged Pepper\n\nHamilton documents, instead relying on the protection afforded by\n\nthe stipulated confidentiality agreement.   See Bogosian v. Gulf\n\nOil Corp., 738 F.2d 587, 591 (3d Cir. 1985).   We must ascertain\n\nwhether mandamus is an appropriate means of immediate appellate\n\nreview of an order compelling the production of privileged\n\ndocuments after those documents have been produced to the\n\ndiscovering party.\n\n          Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton properly exercised their\n\nright to oppose the production of the privileged documents;\n\nhowever, when faced with the choice of seeking immediate relief\n\nthrough mandamus or producing the documents pursuant to the\n\nstipulated confidentiality agreement, Glenmede and Pepper\n\nHamilton opted to produce the privileged documents.     They relied\n\non the fact that the Thompson family had adhered to the terms of\n\nthe confidentiality agreement through the time of production and\n\nthe Thompson's representation to the district court that Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton's concerns regarding public disclosure were\n\nunwarranted in light of the protection afforded by that\n\fagreement.11    The district court's subsequent denial of Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton's request for a protective order to enforce\n\nthe umbrella of the confidentiality agreement stripped Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton of all means of appellate review, except this\n\npost-production mandamus petition, to remedy potential damage\n\nfrom the public disclosure of the Pepper Hamilton documents.12\n\nHence, there are no other avenues of appellate review available\n\nto Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton to attempt to protect the\n\nprivileged documents, which they produced in reliance on the\n\nconfidentiality agreement, from widespread dissemination.    It is\n\nin recognition of these unique circumstances that we proceed to\n\nreview whether there is a clear and indisputable right to the\n\nwrit regarding both the protective order and the order compelling\n\nthe production of the Pepper Hamilton files.    See Cipollone, 785\n\nF.2d at 1118.\n11\n .        We appreciate that our decision in Pansy, decided\nshortly after the production occurred, surprised many by our\nquestioning the judicial endorsement of broad confidentiality\nagreements:\n\n          Disturbingly, some courts routinely sign\n          orders which contain confidentiality clauses\n          without considering the propriety of such\n          orders, or the countervailing public\n          interests which are sacrificed by the orders.\n\n23 F.3d at 785.\n12\n .        The protective order sought by Glenmede and Pepper\nHamilton and denied by the district court was to protect the\numbrella of confidentiality established by the confidentiality\nagreement. The district court has not ruled on the\nconfidentiality of individual documents or categories of\ndocuments. Thus, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton may still seek a\nprotective order to maintain the confidentiality of specific\ncategories of documents or individual documents.\n\f                                III.\n\n          The district court's denial of Glenmede and Pepper\n\nHamilton's request for a protective order was an exercise of the\n\ndistrict court's discretion.    Mandamus is not available for abuse\n\nof discretion but we may exercise mandamus jurisdiction regarding\n\nthe denial of a protective order if we find that the district\n\ncourt committed a clear error of law.     Cipollone, 785 F.2d at\n\n1118.   The district court applied Pansy v. Borough of\n\nStroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772 (3d Cir. 1994), and concluded that\n\npublic policy considerations strongly militated against judicial\n\nsanctioning of the broad pre-Pansy confidentiality agreement\n\nproffered by the parties.    The district court did not commit a\n\nclear error of law requiring our issuing a writ of mandamus.\n\n          A party seeking a protective order over discovery\n\nmaterials must demonstrate that \"good cause\" exists for the\n\nprotection of that material.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c); Pansy, 23\n\nF.3d at 786.   \"Good cause\" is established when it is specifically\n\ndemonstrated that disclosure will cause a clearly defined and\n\nserious injury.   Id.   Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated\n\nby specific examples, however, will not suffice.    Id.   Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton bore the burden of establishing \"good cause\"\n\nto protect the umbrella of confidentiality established by the\n\nconfidentiality agreement.\n\n          In Pansy, we recognized several factors, which are\n\nneither mandatory nor exhaustive, that may be considered in\n\nevaluating whether \"good cause\" exists:\n\f          1)   whether disclosure will violate any privacy\n               interests;\n\n          2)   whether the information is being sought for a\n               legitimate purpose or for an improper purpose;\n\n          3)   whether disclosure of the information will cause a\n               party embarrassment;\n\n          4)   whether confidentiality is being sought over\n               information important to public health and safety;\n\n          5)   whether the sharing of information among litigants\n               will promote fairness and efficiency;\n\n          6)   whether a party benefitting from the order of\n               confidentiality is a public entity or official;\n               and\n\n          7)   whether the case involves issues important to the\n               public;\n\n\n23 F.3d at 787-91.   Although we have recognized that the district\n\ncourt is best situated to determine what factors are relevant to\n\nthe dispute, we have cautioned that the analysis should always\n\nreflect a balancing of private versus public interests --\n\n          Discretion should be left with the court to\n          evaluate the competing considerations in\n          light of the facts of individual cases. By\n          focusing on the particular circumstances in\n          the cases before them, courts are in the best\n          position to prevent both the overly broad use\n          of [confidentiality] orders and the\n          unnecessary denial of confidentiality for\n          information that deserves it . . . .\n\n\nId. at 789 (quoting Arthur R. Miller, Confidentiality, Protective\n\nOrders, and Public Access to the Courts, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 427,\n\n492 (1991)).\n\n          We recognize the distinguishable factual context of\n\nPansy, from the facts of this appeal.   In Pansy, a newspaper\n\fsought access to a settlement agreement entered into between the\n\nBorough of Stroudsburg and its former police chief who had sued\n\nthe Borough after being demoted and suspended for allegedly\n\nmishandling parking meter money.    23 F.3d at 776.    The public\n\ninterest in Pansy was \"particularly legitimate\" given that one of\n\nthe parties to the action was a public entity.     Id. at 786.    The\n\npublic interest in access to information under freedom of\n\ninformation laws was the overriding factor that tipped the\n\nbalance in favor of not granting a confidentiality order which\n\nwould prevent disclosure pursuant to freedom of information laws.\n\nId. at 791-92.   Here, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton assert that\n\nthere is no legitimate public interest to be served by widespread\n\ndissemination of the Pepper Hamilton documents.       See Pansy, 23\n\nF.3d at 788 (\"[I]f a case involves private litigants, and\n\nconcerns matters of little legitimate public interest, that\n\nshould be a factor weighing in favor of granting or maintaining\n\nan order of confidentiality.\").    They contend they will be harmed\n\nby the Thompson family's disclosure of the privileged documents\n\nto other Glenmede clients who were excluded from the transaction\n\nand to the media.   They are unable, however, to articulate any\n\nspecific, cognizable injury from that dissemination.\n\n          Under Pansy, \"[b]road allegations of harm,\nunsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning\" do\n\nnot support a good cause showing.    Id. at 786.   Glenmede and\n\nPepper Hamilton do not describe their harm other than in\n\ngeneralized allegations of injury to reputation and to\n\nrelationships with clients.   For instance, Glenmede and Pepper\n\fHamilton assert that the Thompsons' primary goal in reversing\n\ntheir position on confidentiality \"is to publicize their\n\nallegations of a scheme between Glenmede and [Pepper Hamilton] in\n\norder to maximize the embarrassment and potential economic damage\n\nwhich such averments could generate to those institutions'\n\nrelationships with their clients and the public.\"   Petition at\n\n30.   General allegations of injury to reputation and client\n\nrelationships or embarrassment that may result from dissemination\n\nof privileged documents is insufficient to justify judicial\n\nendorsement of an umbrella confidentiality agreement.13    We have\n\n13\n .        Moreover, the record of this case compels us to deny\nthe requested writ despite our recognition of the importance of\nprotecting the attorney-client privilege. See Haines v. Liggett\nGroup Inc., 975 F.2d 81, 90 (3d Cir. 1992). We reiterate that\nthe district court was never asked to perform an in camera\ninspection of any of the documents in conjunction with the\nrequest for protective order. In fact, when the district court\nrequested that the parties segregate the documents into separate\ncategories for consideration of confidentiality, the parties were\nunable to agree. Nor did Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton seek a\nprotective order for specific documents that may prove harmful to\ntheir client relationships and/or reputations. As the district\ncourt noted:\n\n           [Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton] do not seek a\n           Confidentiality Order. Rather they seek to\n           protect the confidentiality agreement\n           stipulated to by the parties. An \"umbrella\"\n           of confidentiality already exists, but now\n           the defendants must show good cause for\n           protecting that confidentiality agreement.\n\nDecember 2, 1994 Memorandum and Order at 5.\n\n          At oral argument, we questioned whether Glenmede and\nPepper Hamilton may seek relief through an independent breach of\ncontract action stemming from the Thompson family's public\ndissemination of the file documents. (The only disclosure to\ndate by the Thompson family of which we are aware was to aid the\nfiling of a separate action by a similarly-situated plaintiff.)\n\ftypically viewed the \"embarrassment\" factor in terms of non-\n\npecuniary harm to individuals; however, the primary measure of\n\nthe well-being of a business is pecuniary.     See Cipollone, 785\n\nF.2d at 1121.   Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton have failed to\n\nsustain their burden of demonstrating they will sustain a\n\nspecific injury from the public dissemination of the privileged\n\ndocuments sufficient to warrant the entry of an umbrella\n\nprotective order.\n\n          In Pansy, we emphasized the strong public interest in\n\nopen proceedings.    See 23 F.3d 772.   See also Miller v. Indiana\n\nHosp., 16 F.3d 549, 551 (3d Cir. 1994) (\"While we have recognized\n\nthat there are certain delineated areas where openness is not the\n\nnorm . . . [citations omitted], these cases are the exception.\").\n\nThe allegations lodged against Glenmede stemming from its\n\ninvolvement in the buy-back transaction impact the claims or\n\npotential claims of other Glenmede clients who were excluded from\n\nthe transaction.    Federal courts should not provide a shield to\n\npotential claims by entering broad protective orders that prevent\n\npublic disclosure of relevant information.     The sharing of\n\ninformation among current and potential litigants is furthered by\n\nopen proceedings.    See Pansy, 23 F.3d at 787 (\"Circumstances\n\n(..continued)\nPepper Hamilton, however, conceded at oral argument that the\nThompson family's challenge to the confidential designation\naffixed to the file documents comported with the literal terms of\nthe agreement, if not with the spirit of the agreement. The\nagreement contemplated challenges to the confidential designation\nof documents; however, neither Pepper Hamilton nor Glenmede\nanticipated a wholesale challenge to confidentiality of the\nPepper Hamilton file.\n\fweighing against confidentiality exist when confidentiality is\n\nbeing sought over information important to public health and\n\nsafety [citation omitted], and when the sharing of information\n\namong litigants would promote fairness and efficiency [citation\n\nomitted].\").   Absent a showing that a defined and serious injury\n\nwill result from open proceedings, a protective order should not\n\nissue.14\n\n           Despite Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's arguments to the\n\ncontrary, the district court was not required to enter a\n\nprotective order merely to preserve for appellate review its\n\ndeterminations that an exception to the attorney-client privilege\n\napplied.   We have previously recognized the importance of\n\npreserving the right to appeal a determination that an exception\n\nto the attorney-client privilege applies prior to public\n\ndisclosure of the privileged information. In Haines we stated:\n          Because of the sensitivity surrounding the\n          attorney-client privilege, care must be taken\n          that, following any determination that an\n          exception applies, the matters covered by the\n          exception be kept under seal or appropriate\n          court-imposed privacy procedures until all\n          avenues of appeal are exhausted.\n\n\n975 F.2d at 97.   We did not intend, however, to establish a\n\nsteadfast rule that protective orders must always issue to\n\nprotect the privileged character of the materials sought in\n\ndiscovery until all avenues of appeal, including appeal from a\n14\n .        Because it is unnecessary to our decision, we do not\ncomment as to whether Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton would succeed\nin obtaining a protective order regarding specific documents\ncontained in the Pepper Hamilton file.\n\ffinal judgment, are exhausted.   Requiring the issuance of a\n\nprotective order in all circumstances where a district court has\n\ndetermined that an exception to the attorney-client privilege\n\napplies thwarts our policy of open proceedings absent a showing\n\nof good cause to close them.   See Pansy, 23 F.3d 772; Miller, 16\n\nF.3d 549.   Such a rule would be tantamount to permitting the\n\nparties to control the use of protective orders.15   This is\n\nespecially evident where, as here, the party asserting the\n\nprivilege chooses to forego, until final judgment, appellate\n\nreview of the district court's determination that an exception to\n\nthe attorney-client privilege applies.\n\n            The unique evolution of events in this case, however,\n\nbids us to review the district court's determination as to the\n\nscope of Glenmede's waiver of the attorney-client privilege.     We\n\nrecognize that the district court's denial of the protective\n\norder subsequent to the production of the Pepper Hamilton file\n\n15\n .        On March 14, 1995, the Judicial Conference of the\nUnited States rejected a proposed amendment to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 26(c) that provides in part that: \"the court . .\n. may, for good cause shown or on stipulation of the parties,\nmake any order that justice requires to protect a party or person\nfrom annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or\nexpense. . . .\" (Emphasis in original). In addition, the\nproposed rule would add a new section 26(c)(3) that provides a\nmeans for modification or dissolution of a protective order on\nmotion of a party, a person bound by it or a person who has been\npermitted to intervene to seek modification or dissolution. The\nJudicial Conference recommitted the proposed amendments to Rule\n26(c) to the Rules Committee for further study. Judicial\nConference of the United States, Preliminary Report Judicial\nConference Actions, March 14, 1995; Committee on Rules of\nPractice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United\nStates, Report of Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, December 13,\n1994.\n\fjeopardized Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's ability to remedy on\n\nappeal from final judgment the harm, if any, they may suffer as a\n\nresult of the public dissemination of the privileged materials.\n\nThis turn of events places Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton in the\n\nunfortunate and unforeseeable position of seeking post-production\n\nmandamus relief from the disclosure of privileged information.\n\n\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          The attorney-client privilege16 may be waived by a\n\nclient who asserts reliance on the advice of counsel as an\n\naffirmative defense.    See Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, 32 F.3d at 863.\n\nUnder such circumstances, the client has made a conscious\n\ndecision to inject the advice of counsel as an issue in the\n\nlitigation.   Id.   Although we recognized these propositions in\n\n16\n .        Communications that may be protected from disclosure\nduring discovery because of the attorney-client privilege possess\nthe following characteristics:\n\n               (1) the asserted holder of the privilege\n          is or sought to become a client; (2) the\n          person to whom the communication was made (a)\n          is a member of the bar of a court, or his or\n          her subordinate, and (b) in connection with\n          this communication is acting as a lawyer; (3)\n          the communication relates to a fact of which\n          the attorney was informed (a) by his client\n          (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for\n          the purpose of securing primarily either (i)\n          an opinion of law or (ii) legal services or\n          (iii) assistance in some legal proceeding,\n          and (d) not for the purpose of committing a\n          crime or tort; and (4) the privilege has been\n          (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.\n\nRhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. v. Home Indemnity Co., 32 F.3d 851, 862\n(3d Cir. 1994).\n\fRhone-Poulenc, our holding in that case -- that a party does not\n\nlose the privilege to protect attorney-client communications from\n\ndisclosure in discovery when his or her state of mind is placed\n\nat issue -- was premised upon the unique facts of that case.     32\n\nF.3d 864.    In Rhone-Poulenc, advice of counsel was not raised as\n\nan affirmative defense nor were there any acts evincing a clear\n\nintent to waive the attorney-client privilege by placing at issue\n\nreliance on the advice of counsel.    Here, Glenmede raised\n\nreliance on the advice of counsel regarding what parties should\n\nbe included in the buy-back transaction as an affirmative defense\n\nto the Thompson family's claims and voluntarily produced the\n\nOpinion Letter and a draft of it in response to discovery\n\nrequests.\n\n            Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton concede that Glenmede\n\nwaived the attorney-client privilege regarding the Opinion Letter\n\nand any communications between itself and Pepper Hamilton\n\npertaining to that letter.    They object, however, to the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Glenmede's waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege encompassed the entire buy-back transaction, including\n\ninternal Pepper Hamilton back-up documents to the Opinion Letter\n\nthat were never communicated to Glenmede.    They submit that it\n\nwas clear error for the district court to expand the waiver\n\nbeyond the confines of the issue addressed in the Opinion Letter\n\nto all communications, whether written or oral, to or from\n\ncounsel concerning the buy-back transaction.17\n\n17\n .        We note that Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton base their\nargument for our finding a limited waiver of the attorney-client\n\f            There is an inherent risk in permitting the party\n\nasserting a defense of its reliance on advice of counsel to\n\ndefine the parameters of the waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege as to that advice.    That party should not be permitted\n\nto define selectively the subject matter of the advice of counsel\n\non which it relied in order to limit the scope of the waiver of\n\nthe attorney-client privilege and therefore the scope of\n\ndiscovery.    To do so would undermine the very purpose behind the\n\nexception to the attorney-client privilege at issue here --\n\nfairness.\n\n            The party opposing the defense of reliance on advice of\n\ncounsel must be able to test what information had been conveyed\n\nby the client to counsel and vice-versa regarding that advice --\n\nwhether counsel was provided with all material facts in rendering\n\ntheir advice, whether counsel gave a well-informed opinion and\n\nwhether that advice was heeded by the client.   See In re ML-Lee\n\nAcquisition Fund II, L.P., 859 F. Supp. 765, 767 (1994).     Here,\n\nthe advice that Glenmede placed at issue related to the structure\n\nof the transaction -- the identity of the parties and how many of\n\ntheir shares would be repurchased by Oryx.    In fact, the Opinion\n\nLetter indicates that Glenmede requested advice \"concerning the\n\ninclusion of certain private trusts and estates in transactions.\"\n\n(..continued)\nprivilege exclusively on the confines of the attorney-client\nprivilege; they do not rely on the separate attorney work product\ndoctrine to prevent the disclosure of Pepper Hamilton's internal\nfile documents. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d\nCir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 903 (1985); Bogosian v. Gulf Oil\nCorp., 738 F.2d 587 (3d Cir. 1984).\n\fTesting the advice of counsel defense regarding why only the Pew\n\nCharitable Trusts were included in the transaction necessarily\n\nencompasses, as Glenmede acknowledges, more than tax advice.    We\n\nagree with the district court that Glenmede waived the attorney-\n\nclient privilege as to all communications, both written and oral,\n\nto or from counsel as to the entire transaction.\n\n          We also agree that Glenmede's waiver encompasses the\n\nback-up documents to the Opinion Letter, which include Pepper\n\nHamilton's internal research and other file memoranda.18   A\n\nreview of these internal documents may lead to the discovery of\n\nadmissible evidence regarding what information had been conveyed\n\nto Glenmede about the structure of the buy-back transaction and\n\nthe advice of counsel in that regard.   Because it is unnecessary\n\nto our holding, we do not determine whether such documents are\n\nrelevant for any purpose other than the fact that they may lead\n\nto the discovery of admissible evidence.19\n\n\n\n                                V.\n\n\n\n18\n .        We again note that Pepper Hamilton has not asserted\nthat these internal file memoranda are protected by the work\nproduct doctrine, which would have required a different analysis\nby the district court.\n19\n .        We again note that Pepper Hamilton and Glenmede may\npossess other means to protect the confidentiality of some of\nthese internal documents. They have never sought a protective\norder respecting specific internal memoranda that, though\nrelevant for discovery purposes, may reveal information, such as\nclients of Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton or financial information\nnot relevant to the dispute, that is not of public import.\n\f           We also deny Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's request for\n\na writ sealing district court opinions and a hearing transcript\n\nand removing all opinions and pleadings referencing the Pepper\n\nHamilton documents from public access.   As we have previously\n\nrecognized, the right of access to judicial records is beyond\n\ndispute.   See Miller, 16 F.3d at 551; Leucadia, Inc. v. Applied\n\nExtrusion Technologies, Inc., 998 F.2d 157 (3d Cir. 1993).   As we\n\nheld above, we find that the district court did not err in its\n\nrulings as to the scope of Glenmede's waiver of the attorney-\n\nclient privilege and the denial of a protective order requesting\n\nan umbrella of confidentiality for the Pepper Hamilton documents.\n\nThus, we must also deny Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's request\n\nfor mandamus relief from the dissemination of the Pepper Hamilton\n\nfile documents through public access to judicial records.\n\n\n\n                               VI.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the requested\n\nwrits of mandamus.\n\n\n_________________________\n\f",

In that regard, the specific\n\nissue we must decide is whether general allegations of\n\nembarrassment and injury to professional reputations and client\n\nrelationships satisfies the \"good cause\" requirement for the\n\nissuance of an umbrella protective order pursuant to our recent\n\ndecision in Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669670\"><a href=\"/opinion/669670/john-a-pansy-v-borough-of-stroudsburg-harold-a-bentzoni-kathryn-mikels/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir.\n\n1994).   The law firm and its client assert that they will be\n\nunable to rectify the harm to their reputations and client\n\nrelationships if the law firm's privileged documents are publicly\n\ndisseminated.\n\n           We find that although they have established that there\n\nare no alternative avenues of appeal for these discovery orders,\n\nthe law firm and the client trust company have failed to\n\nestablish their clear and indisputable right to the writ.     They\n\nfailed to establish \"good cause\" for the protection of all of the\n\nlaw firm's file documents pursuant to the confidentiality\n\nagreement.   Nor have they demonstrated that the district court\n\nerred in determining that the scope of the client's waiver of the\n\nattorney-client privilege, by injecting the client's reliance on\n\fadvice of counsel as an issue in the underlying action, extended\n\nto the entire transaction, including back-up documents.\n\n          Accordingly, we decline to issue the requested writs.\n\f                                I.\n\n           Glenmede Trust Company (\"Glenmede\") is a Pennsylvania\n\ntrust company that serves as the trustee for several charitable\n\ntrusts, including the Pew Charitable Trusts.1   Glenmede also\n\nserves as a trustee for a number of private trusts and acts as an\n\ninvestment advisor pursuant to a written contract for other\n\nclients.   B. Ray Thompson, Jr., several members of his family2\n\nand the trustees3 of five trusts established by B. Ray Thompson,\n\nSr. for the benefit of his five grandchildren (collectively \"the\n\nThompson Family\") were investment advisory clients of Glenmede.\n\nPrior to September 11, 1990, both the Pew Charitable Trusts and\n\nthe Thompson family held substantial shares of Oryx Energy\n\nCompany stock; the Pew family's Oryx holdings totalled in excess\n\nof 25 million shares and the Thompson family's Oryx holdings\n\ntotalled approximately 2.9 million shares.   In mid-1990, Glenmede\n\nbroached, with Oryx management, the subject of a direct buy-back\n\nof Oryx shares held by the Pew Charitable Trusts.   Oryx was\n\nwilling to repurchase a maximum of 18 million shares at a premium\n\nprice per share but requested that buy-back discussions be kept\n\n1\n .        The Pew Charitable Trusts are comprised of the Pew\nMemorial Trust, the J. Howard Pew Freedom Trust, the Mabel Pew\nMyrin Trust, the Trust under Paragraph 9 of the Will of J. N.\nPew, Jr., and the Trust under the Will of Ethel Pew.\n2\n .        These include B. Ray Thompson's wife, Juanne J.\nThompson, and his five children, Adella S. Thompson, Sarah\nThompson Tarver, Rebekah L. Thompson, Catherine V. Thompson and\nB. Ray Thompson, III.\n3\n .        The trustees are B. Ray Thompson, Jr., Juanne J.\nThompson and Dale A. Keasling.\n\fconfidential.   Given the limitations on the buy-back, Glenmede\n\nconsulted its counsel, Pepper, Hamilton & Scheetz, as to whether\n\nthe Oryx transaction could be extended to include Glenmede's\n\nprivate trust and investment advisory clients.4\n\n          Pepper Hamilton issued an Opinion Letter dated\n\nSeptember 6, 1990 advising Glenmede that the buy-back transaction\n\ncould not be structured to include private clients of Glenmede as\n\nto do so may violate Internal Revenue Code prohibitions on\n\nprivate foundations.5   Pepper Hamilton further advised Glenmede\n\nthat it could not notify its private clients of the buy-back\n\nnegotiations between Oryx and Glenmede acting in its capacity as\n\ntrustee of the Pew Charitable Trusts.   On September 11, 1990,\n\nOryx repurchased through Glenmede 18 million of its common shares\n\nheld by the Pew Charitable Trusts and converted the remaining 7.3\n\nmillion common shares held by the Pew Charitable Trusts to\n\nconvertible preferred shares.   Allegedly, based on the Opinion\n\nLetter from Pepper Hamilton, Glenmede excluded its private\n\nclients with holdings of Oryx stock from the buy-back\ntransaction.\n\n4\n .        Pepper Hamilton had a long-standing relationship with\nGlenmede and the Pew family. It incorporated Glenmede in 1956,\ndrafted the trust instruments for the Pew charitable trusts\nadministered by Glenmede, and attended all meetings of Glenmede's\nBoard of Directors. A partner of Pepper Hamilton always served\nas the secretary and a board member of Glenmede.\n5\n .        The Opinion Letter contained Pepper Hamilton's legal\n\"opinion concerning the inclusion of certain private trusts and\nestates in transactions which may be undertaken by the Glenmede\nTrust Company on behalf of the charitable trusts for which it is\ntrustee.\"\n\f          In September of 1992, the Thompson family brought an\n\naction against Glenmede, its parent Glenmede Corporation, a\n\nnumber of Glenmede officers and directors and the Chairman and\n\nCEO of Oryx, who was dismissed from this action, asserting, inter\n\nalia, claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, breach of\n\ncontract, and negligence, all allegedly arising from Glenmede's\n\nrole in the September 11, 1990 buy-back transaction, in which\n\nOryx repurchased 18 million of its shares from Glenmede as\n\ntrustee of the Pew Charitable Trusts.   Glenmede raised as its\n\nFourteenth affirmative defense to these charges that it \"was\n\nadvised by counsel that it was legally precluded by Internal\n\nRevenue Code prohibitions from including Oryx shares held by\n\nother accounts in the repurchase transaction.\"\n\n          Glenmede concedes that the impact of placing at issue\n\nits reliance on advice of counsel was a waiver of the attorney-\n\nclient privilege limited to the subject matter placed at issue.\n\nGlenmede admitted only to a waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege relating to the subject matter of the Opinion Letter,\n\nwhich it submits is broader than tax advice which is the primary\n\nsubject of the Opinion Letter, but narrower than the totality of\n\nthe advice rendered regarding the buy-back transaction.6    In\n\naccordance with its position, Glenmede produced the Pepper\n\nHamilton Opinion Letter and a draft Opinion Letter in response to\n\ndiscovery requests served by the Thompson family.\n6\n .        Glenmede admitted at oral argument that the waiver was\nbroader than tax advice but narrower than the entire transaction.\nGlenmede, however, did not offer further specificity regarding\nthe scope of its waiver of the attorney-client privilege.\n\f          In response to the Thompson family's concern regarding\n\nthe production of financial records, the parties stipulated to a\n\n\"Confidentiality Order\" restricting the disclosure of documents\n\nto be produced and establishing measures to maintain\n\nconfidentiality pending an appeal from final judgment.   As\n\nevidenced by the terms of the confidentiality agreement, the\n\nparties contemplated the wholesale adoption of that agreement by\n\nthe district court.   Although it was filed with the district\n\ncourt for approval, it was never endorsed in an order of court.\n\nNevertheless, the parties complied with its terms, including the\n\nfiling of pleadings under seal.\n\n          On July 30, 1993, the Thompson family served a subpoena\n\nduces tecum on Pepper Hamilton, requesting its entire file\n\nconcerning services performed for Glenmede in connection with the\n\nbuy-back transaction.   Pepper Hamilton and Glenmede objected to\n\nthe production of Pepper Hamilton's file on the basis of the\n\nattorney-client privilege.   On October 18, 1993, the Thompson\n\nfamily filed a motion to compel the production of the file,\n\narguing that Glenmede waived the attorney-client privilege\n\nbecause it raised reliance on advice of counsel pertaining to the\n\nbuy-back transaction as an affirmative defense to the Thompson\n\nfamily's claims.   The Thompson family further contended that\n\nGlenmede's concern regarding the production of Pepper Hamilton's\n\nfile was unwarranted given the protection afforded by the\n\nconfidentiality agreement to which the parties stipulated.\n\n          By Memorandum and Order dated December 14, 1993, the\n\ndistrict court granted the Thompson family's motion to compel,\n\fconcluding that Glenmede waived its attorney-client privilege\n\nconcerning all communications, whether written or oral, to or\n\nfrom counsel, regarding the buy-back transaction.    The district\n\ncourt ordered that Pepper Hamilton produce its entire file for\n\nservices performed on behalf of Glenmede pertaining to the buy-\n\nback transaction, including all back-up documents to the Opinion\n\nLetter.   Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton moved for reconsideration\n\nof that Memorandum and Order, challenging the district court's\n\nconclusion that their invocation of the defense of reliance on\n\nadvice of counsel resulted in a waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege encompassing all services Pepper Hamilton performed in\n\nconnection with the buy-back transaction.7    Glenmede asserted\n\nthat its waiver was limited to tax advice embodied in the Opinion\n\nLetter.   By Memorandum and Order dated April 8, 1994, the\n\ndistrict court rejected Glenmede's motion for reconsideration on\n\nthe basis that the Opinion Letter discussed a number of issues in\n\naddition to tax advice, including insider trading and the\n\nfinancial ramifications of the transaction.         The district\n\ncourt also concluded that Pepper Hamilton's involvement in\n\nstructuring and closing the transaction required the production\n\nof back-up documents to the Opinion Letter to permit the Thompson\n\nfamily to analyze the reasonableness of Glenmede's reliance on\n\nthe advice of counsel.\n\n\n\n7\n .        At no time did Pepper Hamilton and/or Glenmede seek an\nin camera inspection of the file documents they sought to\npreclude from discovery.\n\f            Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton did not seek a writ of\n\nmandamus for immediate relief from the district court's orders\n\ncompelling the production of documents; they opted to defer\n\nappellate review of the district court's rulings until final\n\njudgment.    Instead, Pepper Hamilton produced in excess of 13,000\n\ndocuments in compliance with the district court's orders.\n\n            On June 20, 1994, Glenmede and the other defendants\n\nfiled a motion for summary judgment under seal, attaching several\n\nPepper Hamilton file documents for which the attorney-client\n\nprivilege had been asserted but deemed waived by the district\n\ncourt.   On June 27, 1994, the Thompson family challenged the\n\n\"confidential\" designation of the Pepper Hamilton file documents\n\nand notified Glenmede of their intent to treat them as non-\n\nconfidential.8   On July 18, 1994, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton\n\nmoved for a Protective Order objecting to the Thompson family's\n\nwholesale challenge to the confidentiality of the documents.      The\n\n\n\n8\n .        The confidentiality agreement provided a mechanism for\nchallenging the designation of documents as \"confidential\" --\nprovide notification to the producing party of challenge to\nconfidentiality, the parties confer in an attempt to resolve the\nchallenge and, if no agreement can be reached, seek court\nintervention. The Thompson family mounted this challenge despite\ntheir representations to the district court that Glenmede and\nPepper Hamilton's concerns regarding public disclosure were\nunwarranted in light of the protection afforded by the stipulated\nconfidentiality agreement. Given our expectation that parties\noperate in good faith during discovery, we note that this\nchallenge closely followed our decision in Pansy v. Borough of\nStroudsburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669670\"><a href=\"/opinion/669670/john-a-pansy-v-borough-of-stroudsburg-harold-a-bentzoni-kathryn-mikels/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. May 2, 1994), regarding the\nimpropriety of the issuance of broad confidentiality orders,\nwhich signaled a shift from the previous practice of judicial\nendorsement of such stipulations.\n\fThompson family cross-moved to unseal the summary judgment\n\ndocuments filed under seal by Glenmede and the other defendants.\n\n          On October 21, 1994, the district court heard arguments\n\non the pending motions.9   It directed the parties to negotiate\n\nthe issues raised in the motion for protective order and to\n\npresent a motion for the confidential treatment of particular\n\ndocuments or categories of documents.   Glenmede, Pepper Hamilton\n\nand the Thompson family, however, were unable to reach an\n\nagreement regarding the confidential status of the Pepper\n\nHamilton file documents.   By Memorandum and Order dated November\n\n22, 1994, the district court granted the Thompson family's motion\n\nto amend the complaint to assert claims against individual Pepper\n\nHamilton attorneys, quoting from a number of the Pepper Hamilton\n\nfile documents.   By Memorandum and Order dated November 29, 1994,\n\nthe district court denied Glenmede and the other defendants'\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n          On November 30, 1994, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton\n\nfiled an emergency motion to seal court records and for\n\nprotective order, seeking to seal both the district court's\n\nNovember 22, 1994 Memorandum and Order and the October 21, 1994\n\nhearing transcript, pending consideration of their motion for\n\nprotective order to keep the Pepper Hamilton documents\n\n\n9\n .        The motions included Glenmede and the other defendants'\nmotion for summary judgment, Glenmede's motion for protective\norder and the Thompson family's motion to add Pepper Hamilton\nattorneys as defendants on the basis of information culled from\nthe Pepper Hamilton file documents, a motion to compel the\nproduction of documents and a motion to unseal the record.\n\fconfidential and for use only in these proceedings.    By\n\nMemorandum and Order dated December 2, 1994, the district court\n\ndenied Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's initial motion for\n\nprotective order and granted the Thompson family's motion to\n\nunseal the record.10   The district court determined that the\n\nconfidentiality agreement did not satisfy Pansy's \"good cause\"\n\nrequirement nor did Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton establish that\n\ndisclosure of the Pepper Hamilton documents would cause them a\n\ndefined and serious harm.\n\n            On December 13, 1994, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton\n\nfiled this petition for a writ of mandamus directing the district\n\ncourt to vacate and reverse its December 14, 1993 and April 8,\n\n1994 Memoranda and Orders compelling the production of the Pepper\n\nHamilton file documents and its December 2, 1994 order denying\n\nconfidentiality protection for those file documents.    In\n\naddition, they seek a writ directing the district court:     to\n\nplace under seal its November 22 and 29, 1994 Memoranda and\n\nOrders, the October 21, 1994 hearing transcript and all briefs\n\nand pleadings that reference the Pepper Hamilton file documents;\n\nto remove all references to those Memoranda and Orders from all\n\npublic access computer databases and district court records; and\n\nto order that the Memoranda and Orders not be published in any\n\nreporter.    Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton contend that the district\n\n\n10\n .        The district court did not dispose of Glenmede and\nPepper Hamilton's emergency motion to seal court records and for\nprotective order until January 12, 1995 when it issued a\nMemorandum and Order denying the unopposed motion.\n\fcourt's denial of the protective order has revealed the Pepper\n\nHamilton file documents to the public, which cannot be remedied\n\non appeal from final judgment.    The public dissemination of the\n\nPepper Hamilton documents is the harm sought to be averted via\n\nthis mandamus petition.\n\n\n\n                                 II.\n\n            This is an appeal from discovery orders which are not\n\nappealable as final decisions within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291.

Once these prerequisites are met, the\n\nissuance of the writ is a matter of discretion.   Id.\n\n          Although mandamus is an appropriate means of immediate\n\nappellate review of orders compelling the production of documents\n\nclaimed to be protected by privilege or other confidentiality\n\ninterest, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton chose not to seek a writ\n\nof mandamus to prevent the production of the privileged Pepper\n\nHamilton documents, instead relying on the protection afforded by\n\nthe stipulated confidentiality agreement.   See Bogosian v. Gulf\n\nOil Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 (3d Cir. 1985).   We must ascertain\n\nwhether mandamus is an appropriate means of immediate appellate\n\nreview of an order compelling the production of privileged\n\ndocuments after those documents have been produced to the\n\ndiscovering party.\n\n          Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton properly exercised their\n\nright to oppose the production of the privileged documents;\n\nhowever, when faced with the choice of seeking immediate relief\n\nthrough mandamus or producing the documents pursuant to the\n\nstipulated confidentiality agreement, Glenmede and Pepper\n\nHamilton opted to produce the privileged documents.     They relied\n\non the fact that the Thompson family had adhered to the terms of\n\nthe confidentiality agreement through the time of production and\n\nthe Thompson's representation to the district court that Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton's concerns regarding public disclosure were\n\nunwarranted in light of the protection afforded by that\n\fagreement.11    The district court's subsequent denial of Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton's request for a protective order to enforce\n\nthe umbrella of the confidentiality agreement stripped Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton of all means of appellate review, except this\n\npost-production mandamus petition, to remedy potential damage\n\nfrom the public disclosure of the Pepper Hamilton documents.12\n\nHence, there are no other avenues of appellate review available\n\nto Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton to attempt to protect the\n\nprivileged documents, which they produced in reliance on the\n\nconfidentiality agreement, from widespread dissemination.    It is\n\nin recognition of these unique circumstances that we proceed to\n\nreview whether there is a clear and indisputable right to the\n\nwrit regarding both the protective order and the order compelling\n\nthe production of the Pepper Hamilton files.    See Cipollone, 785\n\nF.2d at 1118.\n11\n .        We appreciate that our decision in Pansy, decided\nshortly after the production occurred, surprised many by our\nquestioning the judicial endorsement of broad confidentiality\nagreements:\n\n          Disturbingly, some courts routinely sign\n          orders which contain confidentiality clauses\n          without considering the propriety of such\n          orders, or the countervailing public\n          interests which are sacrificed by the orders.\n\n23 F.3d at 785.\n12\n .        The protective order sought by Glenmede and Pepper\nHamilton and denied by the district court was to protect the\numbrella of confidentiality established by the confidentiality\nagreement. The district court has not ruled on the\nconfidentiality of individual documents or categories of\ndocuments. Thus, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton may still seek a\nprotective order to maintain the confidentiality of specific\ncategories of documents or individual documents.\n\f                                III.\n\n          The district court's denial of Glenmede and Pepper\n\nHamilton's request for a protective order was an exercise of the\n\ndistrict court's discretion.    Mandamus is not available for abuse\n\nof discretion but we may exercise mandamus jurisdiction regarding\n\nthe denial of a protective order if we find that the district\n\ncourt committed a clear error of law.

The district court did not commit a\n\nclear error of law requiring our issuing a writ of mandamus.\n\n          A party seeking a protective order over discovery\n\nmaterials must demonstrate that \"good cause\" exists for the\n\nprotection of that material.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c); Pansy, 23\n\nF.3d at 786.   \"Good cause\" is established when it is specifically\n\ndemonstrated that disclosure will cause a clearly defined and\n\nserious injury.   Id.   Broad allegations of harm, unsubstantiated\n\nby specific examples, however, will not suffice.    Id.   Glenmede\n\nand Pepper Hamilton bore the burden of establishing \"good cause\"\n\nto protect the umbrella of confidentiality established by the\n\nconfidentiality agreement.\n\n          In Pansy, we recognized several factors, which are\n\nneither mandatory nor exhaustive, that may be considered in\n\nevaluating whether \"good cause\" exists:\n\f          1)   whether disclosure will violate any privacy\n               interests;\n\n          2)   whether the information is being sought for a\n               legitimate purpose or for an improper purpose;\n\n          3)   whether disclosure of the information will cause a\n               party embarrassment;\n\n          4)   whether confidentiality is being sought over\n               information important to public health and safety;\n\n          5)   whether the sharing of information among litigants\n               will promote fairness and efficiency;\n\n          6)   whether a party benefitting from the order of\n               confidentiality is a public entity or official;\n               and\n\n          7)   whether the case involves issues important to the\n               public;\n\n\n23 F.3d at 787-91.   Although we have recognized that the district\n\ncourt is best situated to determine what factors are relevant to\n\nthe dispute, we have cautioned that the analysis should always\n\nreflect a balancing of private versus public interests --\n\n          Discretion should be left with the court to\n          evaluate the competing considerations in\n          light of the facts of individual cases. By\n          focusing on the particular circumstances in\n          the cases before them, courts are in the best\n          position to prevent both the overly broad use\n          of [confidentiality] orders and the\n          unnecessary denial of confidentiality for\n          information that deserves it . . . .\n\n\nId. at 789 (quoting Arthur R. Miller, Confidentiality, Protective\n\nOrders, and Public Access to the Courts, 105 Harv. L. Rev. 427,\n\n492 (1991)).\n\n          We recognize the distinguishable factual context of\n\nPansy, from the facts of this appeal.   In Pansy, a newspaper\n\fsought access to a settlement agreement entered into between the\n\nBorough of Stroudsburg and its former police chief who had sued\n\nthe Borough after being demoted and suspended for allegedly\n\nmishandling parking meter money.    23 F.3d at 776.    The public\n\ninterest in Pansy was \"particularly legitimate\" given that one of\n\nthe parties to the action was a public entity.     Id. at 786.    The\n\npublic interest in access to information under freedom of\n\ninformation laws was the overriding factor that tipped the\n\nbalance in favor of not granting a confidentiality order which\n\nwould prevent disclosure pursuant to freedom of information laws.\n\nId. at 791-92.   Here, Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton assert that\n\nthere is no legitimate public interest to be served by widespread\n\ndissemination of the Pepper Hamilton documents.       See Pansy, 23\n\nF.3d at 788 (\"[I]f a case involves private litigants, and\n\nconcerns matters of little legitimate public interest, that\n\nshould be a factor weighing in favor of granting or maintaining\n\nan order of confidentiality.\").    They contend they will be harmed\n\nby the Thompson family's disclosure of the privileged documents\n\nto other Glenmede clients who were excluded from the transaction\n\nand to the media.   They are unable, however, to articulate any\n\nspecific, cognizable injury from that dissemination.\n\n          Under Pansy, \"[b]road allegations of harm,\nunsubstantiated by specific examples or articulated reasoning\" do\n\nnot support a good cause showing.    Id. at 786.   Glenmede and\n\nPepper Hamilton do not describe their harm other than in\n\ngeneralized allegations of injury to reputation and to\n\nrelationships with clients.   For instance, Glenmede and Pepper\n\fHamilton assert that the Thompsons' primary goal in reversing\n\ntheir position on confidentiality \"is to publicize their\n\nallegations of a scheme between Glenmede and [Pepper Hamilton] in\n\norder to maximize the embarrassment and potential economic damage\n\nwhich such averments could generate to those institutions'\n\nrelationships with their clients and the public.\"   Petition at\n\n30.   General allegations of injury to reputation and client\n\nrelationships or embarrassment that may result from dissemination\n\nof privileged documents is insufficient to justify judicial\n\nendorsement of an umbrella confidentiality agreement.13    We have\n\n13\n .        Moreover, the record of this case compels us to deny\nthe requested writ despite our recognition of the importance of\nprotecting the attorney-client privilege. See Haines v. Liggett\nGroup Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590904\"><a href=\"/opinion/590904/susan-haines-as-administratrix-ad-prosequendum-and-of-the-estate-of-peter/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90 (3d Cir. 1992). We reiterate that\nthe district court was never asked to perform an in camera\ninspection of any of the documents in conjunction with the\nrequest for protective order. In fact, when the district court\nrequested that the parties segregate the documents into separate\ncategories for consideration of confidentiality, the parties were\nunable to agree. Nor did Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton seek a\nprotective order for specific documents that may prove harmful to\ntheir client relationships and/or reputations. As the district\ncourt noted:\n\n           [Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton] do not seek a\n           Confidentiality Order. Rather they seek to\n           protect the confidentiality agreement\n           stipulated to by the parties. An \"umbrella\"\n           of confidentiality already exists, but now\n           the defendants must show good cause for\n           protecting that confidentiality agreement.\n\nDecember 2, 1994 Memorandum and Order at 5.\n\n          At oral argument, we questioned whether Glenmede and\nPepper Hamilton may seek relief through an independent breach of\ncontract action stemming from the Thompson family's public\ndissemination of the file documents. (The only disclosure to\ndate by the Thompson family of which we are aware was to aid the\nfiling of a separate action by a similarly-situated plaintiff.)\n\ftypically viewed the \"embarrassment\" factor in terms of non-\n\npecuniary harm to individuals; however, the primary measure of\n\nthe well-being of a business is pecuniary.     See Cipollone, 785\n\nF.2d at 1121.   Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton have failed to\n\nsustain their burden of demonstrating they will sustain a\n\nspecific injury from the public dissemination of the privileged\n\ndocuments sufficient to warrant the entry of an umbrella\n\nprotective order.\n\n          In Pansy, we emphasized the strong public interest in\n\nopen proceedings.

Federal courts should not provide a shield to\n\npotential claims by entering broad protective orders that prevent\n\npublic disclosure of relevant information.     The sharing of\n\ninformation among current and potential litigants is furthered by\n\nopen proceedings.    See Pansy, 23 F.3d at 787 (\"Circumstances\n\n(..continued)\nPepper Hamilton, however, conceded at oral argument that the\nThompson family's challenge to the confidential designation\naffixed to the file documents comported with the literal terms of\nthe agreement, if not with the spirit of the agreement.

Absent a showing that a defined and serious injury\n\nwill result from open proceedings, a protective order should not\n\nissue.14\n\n           Despite Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's arguments to the\n\ncontrary, the district court was not required to enter a\n\nprotective order merely to preserve for appellate review its\n\ndeterminations that an exception to the attorney-client privilege\n\napplied.   We have previously recognized the importance of\n\npreserving the right to appeal a determination that an exception\n\nto the attorney-client privilege applies prior to public\n\ndisclosure of the privileged information. In Haines we stated:\n          Because of the sensitivity surrounding the\n          attorney-client privilege, care must be taken\n          that, following any determination that an\n          exception applies, the matters covered by the\n          exception be kept under seal or appropriate\n          court-imposed privacy procedures until all\n          avenues of appeal are exhausted.\n\n\n975 F.2d at 97.

Requiring the issuance of a\n\nprotective order in all circumstances where a district court has\n\ndetermined that an exception to the attorney-client privilege\n\napplies thwarts our policy of open proceedings absent a showing\n\nof good cause to close them.

Such a rule would be tantamount to permitting the\n\nparties to control the use of protective orders.15   This is\n\nespecially evident where, as here, the party asserting the\n\nprivilege chooses to forego, until final judgment, appellate\n\nreview of the district court's determination that an exception to\n\nthe attorney-client privilege applies.\n\n            The unique evolution of events in this case, however,\n\nbids us to review the district court's determination as to the\n\nscope of Glenmede's waiver of the attorney-client privilege.     We\n\nrecognize that the district court's denial of the protective\n\norder subsequent to the production of the Pepper Hamilton file\n\n15\n .        On March 14, 1995, the Judicial Conference of the\nUnited States rejected a proposed amendment to Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 26(c) that provides in part that: \"the court . .\n. may, for good cause shown or on stipulation of the parties,\nmake any order that justice requires to protect a party or person\nfrom annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or\nexpense. . . .\" (Emphasis in original). In addition, the\nproposed rule would add a new section 26(c)(3) that provides a\nmeans for modification or dissolution of a protective order on\nmotion of a party, a person bound by it or a person who has been\npermitted to intervene to seek modification or dissolution.

In Rhone-Poulenc, advice of counsel was not raised as\n\nan affirmative defense nor were there any acts evincing a clear\n\nintent to waive the attorney-client privilege by placing at issue\n\nreliance on the advice of counsel.    Here, Glenmede raised\n\nreliance on the advice of counsel regarding what parties should\n\nbe included in the buy-back transaction as an affirmative defense\n\nto the Thompson family's claims and voluntarily produced the\n\nOpinion Letter and a draft of it in response to discovery\n\nrequests.\n\n            Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton concede that Glenmede\n\nwaived the attorney-client privilege regarding the Opinion Letter\n\nand any communications between itself and Pepper Hamilton\n\npertaining to that letter.    They object, however, to the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that Glenmede's waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege encompassed the entire buy-back transaction, including\n\ninternal Pepper Hamilton back-up documents to the Opinion Letter\n\nthat were never communicated to Glenmede.    They submit that it\n\nwas clear error for the district court to expand the waiver\n\nbeyond the confines of the issue addressed in the Opinion Letter\n\nto all communications, whether written or oral, to or from\n\ncounsel concerning the buy-back transaction.17\n\n17\n .        We note that Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton base their\nargument for our finding a limited waiver of the attorney-client\n\f            There is an inherent risk in permitting the party\n\nasserting a defense of its reliance on advice of counsel to\n\ndefine the parameters of the waiver of the attorney-client\n\nprivilege as to that advice.    That party should not be permitted\n\nto define selectively the subject matter of the advice of counsel\n\non which it relied in order to limit the scope of the waiver of\n\nthe attorney-client privilege and therefore the scope of\n\ndiscovery.    To do so would undermine the very purpose behind the\n\nexception to the attorney-client privilege at issue here --\n\nfairness.\n\n            The party opposing the defense of reliance on advice of\n\ncounsel must be able to test what information had been conveyed\n\nby the client to counsel and vice-versa regarding that advice --\n\nwhether counsel was provided with all material facts in rendering\n\ntheir advice, whether counsel gave a well-informed opinion and\n\nwhether that advice was heeded by the client.

Because it is unnecessary\n\nto our holding, we do not determine whether such documents are\n\nrelevant for any purpose other than the fact that they may lead\n\nto the discovery of admissible evidence.19\n\n\n\n                                V.\n\n\n\n18\n .        We again note that Pepper Hamilton has not asserted\nthat these internal file memoranda are protected by the work\nproduct doctrine, which would have required a different analysis\nby the district court.\n19\n .        We again note that Pepper Hamilton and Glenmede may\npossess other means to protect the confidentiality of some of\nthese internal documents. They have never sought a protective\norder respecting specific internal memoranda that, though\nrelevant for discovery purposes, may reveal information, such as\nclients of Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton or financial information\nnot relevant to the dispute, that is not of public import.\n\f           We also deny Glenmede and Pepper Hamilton's request for\n\na writ sealing district court opinions and a hearing transcript\n\nand removing all opinions and pleadings referencing the Pepper\n\nHamilton documents from public access.
