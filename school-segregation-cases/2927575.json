In\n\nthree issues, Davenport Meadows generally contends (1) the evidence shows the Dobrushkins\n\ncommitted fraud, and (2) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the award of\n\nattorney’s fees. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n       In August 2006, Jacob and Galina Dobrushkin entered into a “New Home Contract,”\n\nagreeing to purchase a townhome from Davenport Meadows that had yet to be constructed. The\n\ncontract required the Dobrushkins to deposit $5,000 as earnest money and provided for a\n\nDecember 31, 2007 closing date. The house was not completed until October 30, 2008, and the\n\nparties orally agreed to extend the closing date.       According to Davenport Meadows, the\n\nDobrushkins specifically agreed to a December 5, 2008 closing date.\n\f       The Dobrushkins did not, however, close on the house. At trial, Jacob Dobrushkin\n\ntestified that he had still wanted to purchase the house and that he tried to “till the very end,” but\n\nhis financial condition had changed considerably during the economic downturn of 2008, and he\n\ncould no longer afford to do so. Davenport Meadows presented evidence that the Dobrushkins\n\ncould have purchased the house had they borrowed from a home equity line of credit for the\n\ndown payment.\n\n       Regardless, in December 2008, the Dobrushkins sent Davenport Meadows notice they\n\nwere terminating the contract and demanded their earnest money back because Davenport\n\nMeadows had not completed the townhome on time. Davenport Meadows sent the Dobrushkins\n\na letter stating if the Dobrushkins did not close, it would agree to termination of the contract in\n\nexchange for retention of their earnest money and another $5,000 in damages due to the\n\nDobrushkins’ “default and failure to communicate their intention not to close in a timely\n\nmanner.”\n\n       When the Dobrushkins did not respond, Davenport Meadows sent them notice it was\n\nterminating the contract and electing to receive the earnest money as liquidated damages.\n\nDavenport Meadows stated it was not, however, releasing them from the additional damages\n\ncaused by Dobrushkins misrepresenting their intent to close on the property.\n\n       Davenport Meadows subsequently sued the Dobrushkins for breach of contract and fraud.\n\nThe jury found against Davenport Meadows on its breach of contract claim, concluding it had\n\nelected to receive the Dobrushkins’ earnest money as its remedy for that claim. The jury also\n\nfound against Davenport Meadows on its fraud claim. The jury awarded the Dobrushkins $9,675\n\nin attorney’s fees pursuant to a provision in the New Home Contract that the prevailing party\n\nrecover reasonable attorney’s fees in any legal proceeding related to the contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 –2–\n\f           In its first issue, Davenport Meadows contends “[t]he evidence demonstrates that [the\n\nDobrushkins] committed fraud against [it], in contrast to the jury’s findings.”           Davenport\n\nMeadows does not specify whether it is raising a legal or factual sufficiency of the evidence\n\ncomplaint or direct us to any standard of review. Indeed, although the trial court’s judgment is\n\nbased on a jury verdict, Davenport Meadows does not identify the particular findings the jury\n\nmade and it relies on statements in pleadings and affidavits filed in the trial court, but not\n\nadmitted before the jury, as “evidence” to support its contention.\n\n           To comply with rule 38.1(f) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, an appellant must\n\narticulate the issue we will be asked to decide. Bolling v. Farmers Branch Indep. Sch. Dist., 315\n\nS.W.3d 893, 896 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.). If the issue is identified, then rule 38.1(i)\n\nrequires an appellant to provide direct citations to the record to support its factual assertions. Id.\n\nIf record references are not made or are inaccurate, misstated, or misleading, the brief fails. Id.\n\nAn appellant must also provide legal authority to support the legal questions we are asked to\n\ndecide. Id.\n\n           Here, Davenport Meadows generally challenges the trial court’s judgment, but does not\n\nproperly attack the jury findings on which the judgment was based. Nor does it properly attack\n\nthe judgment in light of the evidence actually presented to the jury under the proper standard of\n\nreview. Its complaint is not, therefore, a proper attack on the judgment. We conclude this issue\n\nis improperly and inadequately briefed and presents nothing to review. See TEX. R. APP. P.\n\n38.1(i).\n\n           In its second and third issues, Davenport Meadows contends the evidence of attorney’s\n\nfees is legally and factually insufficient. At trial, Davenport Meadows first offered testimony to\n\nsupport its claim for attorney’s fees in the event the jury found in its favor. Its counsel, Barton\n\nReeder, testified his billing rate was $225 and that he spent 123 hours in the course of trial\n\n                                                 –3–\n\fpreparation, including preparation of pleadings, motions, and discovery requests and responses.\n\nIn support of their award of attorney’s fees, the Dobrushkins’ counsel, J.J. Hopkins, referenced\n\nReeder’s testimony stating he spent “approximately the same amount of time” as Reeder and that\n\nthe issues had been very similar for both, preparing discovery, motions, et cetera. He said his\n\ntypical billing rate was $250, which was “very conservative.” He said to “make matters easy for\n\nthe jury” he had spent about the same amount of time on the case as Mr. Reeder, at $225. He\n\nsaid of the 123 hours, eighty hours was attributable to the breach of contract claim and forty-\n\nthree to the fraud claim. He indicated that he needed to separate out the hours spent on the\n\nbreach of contract claim because that was the Dobrushkins “only avenue of recovery.”\n\nAccording to Hopkins, $20,000 would compensate the Dobrushkins for having to defend the\n\nbreach of contract claim. 1 Davenport Meadows did not object to Hopkins’ testimony. 2 Nor did\n\nit question Hopkins about whether or how he documented his hours or question whether the\n\nhours expended were reasonable and necessary.\n\n           Instead, on cross-examination, Davenport Meadows questioned Hopkins only about what\n\nfees he had segregated. In particular, it questioned Hopkins about whether he deducted the hours\n\nhe spent drafting and nonsuiting a breach of contract claim that the Dobrushkins had initially\n\nbrought against Davenport Meadows, but nonsuited. Hopkins responded that he had, but that he\n\nhad spent very little time on that claim, “literally maybe an hour.” Davenport Meadows also\n\nquestioned Hopkins about whether he segregated the fees expended on unsuccessful motions for\n\nsummary judgment that related to the Dobrushkins’ defense of the breach of contract case.\n\nHopkins said he did not segregate those fees because they were spent defending that claim.\n\n     1\n       How Hopkins arrived at the $20,000 figure is unclear and his testimony regarding the calculation is incorrect. He testified “if you do the\nmath there, 80 times 225 is 1600 plus -- $20,000.” We note, however, that eighty times Hopkins typical billing rate of $250 equals $20,000.\n     2\n       When a party complains about the reliability of the basis of a scientific expert’s opinion, a timely objection is required to give the offering\nparty an opportunity to cure any defect that may exist. Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 409 (Tex. 1998). Here, had\nDavenport Meadows sought further specificity, Hopkins would have had the opportunity to provide more specific testimony or documentation.\n\n\n\n                                                                        –4–\n\f       In the charge, the jury was asked “What is a reasonable fee for the Dobrushkins’ attorney\n\nin this case, stated in dollars and cents, if any?” The jury found $9,675 was a reasonable fee for\n\npreparation and trial, but it awarded no fees for any subsequent appeals. The trial court entered\n\njudgment on the verdict.\n\n       According to Davenport Meadows, the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport the attorney’s fee award. The only authority it cites is El Apple, Ltd v. Olivas, 370\n\nS.W.3d 757 (Tex. 2012). In El Apple, the Texas Supreme Court stated:\n\n                       Under the lodestar method, the determination of what constitutes a\n               reasonable attorney's fee involves two steps. First, the court must determine the\n               reasonable hours spent by counsel in the case and a reasonable hourly rate for\n               such work. The court then multiplies the number of such hours by the applicable\n               rate, the product of which is the base fee or lodestar. The court may then adjust\n               the base lodestar up or down (apply a multiplier), if relevant factors indicate an\n               adjustment is necessary to reach a reasonable fee in the case.\n\nId. at 760 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court concluded the plaintiff in that case failed to\n\npresent legally sufficient evidence for a lodestar calculation because it failed to prove the number\n\nof hours reasonably expended on the litigation. See id. at 763-64. Here, in asserting El Apple\n\nrequires the attorney fee’s award be set aside, Davenport Meadows ignores that it must\n\nchallenge, and we must review, a jury determination of attorney’s fees.\n\n       In reviewing a jury finding, we review the evidence in light of the charge actually given.\n\nBarker v. Eckman, 213 S.W.3d 306, 312 (Tex. 2006). Here, the jury was given no definitions\n\nwith respect to reasonable attorney’s fees. In particular, the jury was not instructed it was\n\nrequired to make a lodestar calculation by first specifically determining the reasonable hours\n\nspent by counsel and the reasonable hourly rate. Additionally, Davenport Meadows’ specific\n\ncomplaints focus largely on the lack of specificity with respect to Hopkins’ testimony with\n\nrespect to segregation. But it fails to discuss the contractual provision that authorized the award\n\nof attorney’s fees and fails to provide any argument or authority that Hopkins was required to\n\n                                                –5–\n\fsegregate any fees in the first instance. 3 See Rich v. Olah, 274 S.W.3d 878, 888 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2008, no pet.) (party entitled to recover attorney’s fees for defending fraud claim related\n\nto contract where the contract provided for an award of an attorney’s fees to the “prevailing party\n\nin any legal proceeding related to this contract.”). Moreover, the jury charge did not require the\n\njury to segregate fees. See Green International, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389–90 (Tex.\n\n1997).\n\n           Davenport Meadows has failed to cite pertinent authority regarding a challenge to a jury\n\nfinding on attorney’s fees, has failed to discuss the evidence in light of the actual jury charge\n\ngiven or the contract that authorized such fees, and has failed to provide argument or analysis\n\nexplaining how El Apple should be applied to the jury finding in this case. We conclude these\n\nissues have not been adequately briefed and are waived. 4 See TEX. R. APP. P 38.1(i); Shaw v.\n\nCounty of Dallas, 251 S.W.3d 165, 172 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied).\n\n           We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             /Michael J. O'Neill/\n                                                                             MICHAEL J. O'NEILL\n                                                                             JUSTICE\n\n121471F.P05\n\n\n\n\n           3\n            We recognize that Hopkins testified that he would have to “separate out” the hours spent defending the fraud claim because their\nonly avenue of recovery was under the breach of contract claim. The jury, however, was properly instructed that “in matters of law, [it] must be\ngoverned by the instructions in [the] charge.” Further, that counsel may have requested less than he was entitled to does not impact a sufficiency\nanalysis. See City of Fort Worth v. Zimlich, 29 S.W.3d 62, 73 (Tex. 2000) (jury may award more damages than requested if supported by the\nevidence).\n           4\n           Hopkins’ testimony, including all of the hours worked and multiplying it by his typical billing rate, would result in a “lodestar” of\n$30,750. The jury awarded Davenport Meadows $9,675.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      –6–\n\f                                         S\n                               Court of Appeals\n                        Fifth District of Texas at Dallas\n                                       JUDGMENT\n\nDAVENPORT MEADOWS, LP, Appellant                      On Appeal from the County Court at Law\n                                                      No. 6, Collin County, Texas\nNo. 05-12-01471-CV         V.

Its counsel, Barton\n\nReeder, testified his billing rate was $225 and that he spent 123 hours in the course of trial\n\n                                                 –3–\n\fpreparation, including preparation of pleadings, motions, and discovery requests and responses.\n\nIn support of their award of attorney’s fees, the Dobrushkins’ counsel, J.J. Hopkins, referenced\n\nReeder’s testimony stating he spent “approximately the same amount of time” as Reeder and that\n\nthe issues had been very similar for both, preparing discovery, motions, et cetera. He said his\n\ntypical billing rate was $250, which was “very conservative.” He said to “make matters easy for\n\nthe jury” he had spent about the same amount of time on the case as Mr. Reeder, at $225. He\n\nsaid of the 123 hours, eighty hours was attributable to the breach of contract claim and forty-\n\nthree to the fraud claim. He indicated that he needed to separate out the hours spent on the\n\nbreach of contract claim because that was the Dobrushkins “only avenue of recovery.”\n\nAccording to Hopkins, $20,000 would compensate the Dobrushkins for having to defend the\n\nbreach of contract claim. 1 Davenport Meadows did not object to Hopkins’ testimony. 2 Nor did\n\nit question Hopkins about whether or how he documented his hours or question whether the\n\nhours expended were reasonable and necessary.\n\n           Instead, on cross-examination, Davenport Meadows questioned Hopkins only about what\n\nfees he had segregated. In particular, it questioned Hopkins about whether he deducted the hours\n\nhe spent drafting and nonsuiting a breach of contract claim that the Dobrushkins had initially\n\nbrought against Davenport Meadows, but nonsuited. Hopkins responded that he had, but that he\n\nhad spent very little time on that claim, “literally maybe an hour.” Davenport Meadows also\n\nquestioned Hopkins about whether he segregated the fees expended on unsuccessful motions for\n\nsummary judgment that related to the Dobrushkins’ defense of the breach of contract case.\n\nHopkins said he did not segregate those fees because they were spent defending that claim.\n\n     1\n       How Hopkins arrived at the $20,000 figure is unclear and his testimony regarding the calculation is incorrect. He testified “if you do the\nmath there, 80 times 225 is 1600 plus -- $20,000.” We note, however, that eighty times Hopkins typical billing rate of $250 equals $20,000.\n     2\n       When a party complains about the reliability of the basis of a scientific expert’s opinion, a timely objection is required to give the offering\nparty an opportunity to cure any defect that may exist.

Here, had\nDavenport Meadows sought further specificity, Hopkins would have had the opportunity to provide more specific testimony or documentation.\n\n\n\n                                                                        –4–\n\f       In the charge, the jury was asked “What is a reasonable fee for the Dobrushkins’ attorney\n\nin this case, stated in dollars and cents, if any?” The jury found $9,675 was a reasonable fee for\n\npreparation and trial, but it awarded no fees for any subsequent appeals. The trial court entered\n\njudgment on the verdict.\n\n       According to Davenport Meadows, the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\n\nsupport the attorney’s fee award. The only authority it cites is El Apple, Ltd v. Olivas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">757</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2012). In El Apple, the Texas Supreme Court stated:\n\n                       Under the lodestar method, the determination of what constitutes a\n               reasonable attorney's fee involves two steps. First, the court must determine the\n               reasonable hours spent by counsel in the case and a reasonable hourly rate for\n               such work. The court then multiplies the number of such hours by the applicable\n               rate, the product of which is the base fee or lodestar. The court may then adjust\n               the base lodestar up or down (apply a multiplier), if relevant factors indicate an\n               adjustment is necessary to reach a reasonable fee in the case.\n\nId. at 760 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court concluded the plaintiff in that case failed to\n\npresent legally sufficient evidence for a lodestar calculation because it failed to prove the number\n\nof hours reasonably expended on the litigation. See id. at 763-64. Here, in asserting El Apple\n\nrequires the attorney fee’s award be set aside, Davenport Meadows ignores that it must\n\nchallenge, and we must review, a jury determination of attorney’s fees.\n\n       In reviewing a jury finding, we review the evidence in light of the charge actually given.\n\nBarker v.

Here, the jury was given no definitions\n\nwith respect to reasonable attorney’s fees. In particular, the jury was not instructed it was\n\nrequired to make a lodestar calculation by first specifically determining the reasonable hours\n\nspent by counsel and the reasonable hourly rate. Additionally, Davenport Meadows’ specific\n\ncomplaints focus largely on the lack of specificity with respect to Hopkins’ testimony with\n\nrespect to segregation. But it fails to discuss the contractual provision that authorized the award\n\nof attorney’s fees and fails to provide any argument or authority that Hopkins was required to\n\n                                                –5–\n\fsegregate any fees in the first instance. 3 See Rich v.
